[DAN, a considerable river of N. Carolina, which unites with the Staunton, and forms the Roanoke. In May 1795, a boat 53 feet long, and about seven tons burden, passed from Upper Saura town to Halifax, about 200 miles above Halifax, under the direction of Mr. Jeremiah Wade. She  brought about nine hogsheads from the above place, six of which she discharged at St. Taminy, 40 miles above Halifax, to which place the river has been cleared by the donations of individuals. From St. Taminy to Halifax she brought about 5000 weight through the falls, which hitherto had been deemed impassable. Mr. Wade thinks, safe navigation for boats of a larger burden may be made at a small expence. The famous Bursted hill stands on the bank of the Dan in Virginia, near the borders of N. Carolina. It appears to have been an ancient volcano. There are large rocks of the lava or melted matter, from 1000 to 1500 weight, lying on the summit of the hill.

[DANISH America. In the W. Indies the Danes possess the islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix,  or Santa Cruz, and St. John's ; which are described under their respective names. The Danish policy, in respect to their islands, is wise, and deserving of imitation. These islands were ill managed, and of little consequence to the Danes, whilst in the hands of an exclusive company ; but since the late king bought up the company's stock, and laid the trade open, the islands have been greatly improved. By an edict of the Danish king, no slaves were to be imported into his islands after the year 1802 ; till then their importation was encouraged by a law operating as a bounty. Many of the inhabitants of Greenland, and Negroes of the Danish W. India islands, have embraced Christianity under the Moravian missionaries, who are unwearied in their humane exertions. See Santa Cruz, &c]

==[[Daribazana|DARIBAZANA]]==, a settlement of the missions, which belong to the religious order of the Carmelites of Portugal, in the province and country of Las Amazonas ; situate on the shore of the river Negro. 
==[[Darien|DARIEN]]==, a province of the kingdom of Tierra Firme, one of the three, and the larger of those which compose the government of this kingdom. It is bounded n. and s. by the two seas, e. by the province of Tierra Firme, and w. by that of Choco. It is 68 leagues long e. as. and not 100, according to the Exjesuit Coleti, and about 50 wide n. s. at the broadest part. It is a mountainous and rugged country, but not without its llanuras orplains, where it is very fertile, though deserted and uncultivated, producing only a small proportion of cacao and tdbacco; both of which are of an excellent quality. It is watered by an infinite number of rivers, some of which enter the S. sea, and others the N. in the sands of which are found a certain portion of gold washed down from the many mines of this metal found here ; the largest of which was the mine of Santa Cruz de Cana, from which in former times infinite wealth had been extracted. This province was the first in Tierra Firme in which the Spaniards established themselves, when it was conquered by the president Vasco Nunez de Balboa ; here also Francisco Pizarro, the conqueror of Peru^ manifested incredible feats of valour. The climate is very moist and unhealthy ; for which reason the settlements that it had were abandoned, a small one only of Spaniards remaining, with a little fort, which was furnished by a detachment that came every month from Panama, for the sake of guarding the gold mines. Its natives, according to the calculation made in 1747 by its governor Don Joaquin Valcarcel de Miranda, amounted to 5000 families. They are valoroUs and hardy, but cruel, stupid, and faithless, incapable of being reduced to the b 2   DARIEN.  dictates of religion, or the laws of civil society. At this time, however, they appear to have made several attempts, but were as often drawn back to their idolatrous ways, and retired into their native mountains. They live by fishing and the chase, in which latter they are very dexterous, and extremely skilful in the use of the bow and arrow : their bows are made of a very strong but flexible kind of wood, called chorda ; and their arrows of a species of light cane called viruli, the point being of fishbones, or of the same chonta roasted or burnt. Their favourite food is the flesh of monkeys, and there are an incredible variety of these animals here. They are much addicted to inebriety and sensual gratifications ; for the former, they make use of a Kind of drink called mazato, which is a fermentation of maize and plantains : they go almost naked, and wear only a cloth which serves to cover them in front, and which they call panequiri. They all deck themselves for dressornaments with some small golden rings pendant from the nose, the gristle of which is bored for this purpose directly after their children are born : no less care is observed in cultivating the growth of the hair, and of permitting it to flow down unconfined. The women adorn both their legs and arms with strings of coral, beads of glass and of gold. The priests, who are called Leres, and to whom singular respect is shown, paint their faces of various colours, making incisions to insert the bitumen that they use, and which never leaves them, but renders them for ever after horrible and deformed. It has been affirmed by some that these priests have communication with the Devil, and that they are, upon this account, confirmed in their unnatural and beastly customs. The advantageous situation of this province, communicating as it does with the two seas, its fertility, were it cultivated, and its riches, have excited a desire amongst the English and the French of establishing themselves in it. The former effected this in 1699 in the port of Caledonia, from whence they were ejected by the Spaniards. These also began to establish themselves here in 1740, and first made the plantations of tobacco ; but they were put to the sword in 1754 by the Indians, who were abetted by the English; these having given them arms, and instructed them in the use of the musket, so that they became as dexterous in the use of this weapon as in their bows and arrows. These Indians are at war with the Chocoes, keeping up an enmity which is handed down from father to son, and arising from the circumstance of the Indians of Darien having put to death a curate, who was held in high reverence by ihem } about the end of the last century ; and from  that time, each of them carry a skull of an Indian of Darien, who has met his fate at their hands, out of which he regularly drinks. These animosities, together with the frequent ravages of the smallpox, may be considered the causes why their number has been much diminished. The enmity, likewise, which they manifest towards the Spaniards, is not less ; for they rose against them in a body in 1719, committing incredible cruelties, until 1740, when a peace was entered into with them, by the Lieutenantgeneral D. Dionisio Martinez de la Vega, president, governor, and captaingeneral of the kingdom ; the articles being, that they should forthwith be reduced to settlements, and that they should admit amongst them missionaries, who might instruct them in the Catholic religion. To effect this, the viceroy of Santa Fe, who was then Don Sebastian de Eslaba, sent two Jesuits of the province of Cartagena with a mission towards the n. part, namely, the fathers Salvador Grande and Pedro Fabro, and towards the s. the president of Panama sent the fathers Matias Alvarez and Glaudio Escobar, who with the greatest zeal formed the settlements of Morineca, Balzas, Tucuti, Ghucunaque, Cupa, and Yabiza. But when they thought to have reaped the fruits of their labour, these Indians abandoned the settlements, returning to their errors of idolatry, and revisiting their native mountains. The fathers were indeed preserved in a miraculous manner, owing their lives to the information imparted to them by an old Indian woman. They became after this quite desperate as to the object of their wishes, and it was then proposed by an individual of some authority, that the Indians of Clioco should be for a time freed from the tribute, so that the Spaniards might in the mean time procure their extermination. This plan, however, was thought too cruel by the government, and consequently rejected. In the last year, 1786, their conquest was attempted by force of arms by the viceroy, and archbishop of Santa Fe, Don Antonio Caballero y Gongora, who entrusted an expedition to the charge of the brigadier Don Antonio de Arevalo, and he succeeded in forming different establishments and settlements ; but the badness of the climate, combined with the ferocity of the natives, did not permit the object of his wishes to be realized. Darien, with the dedicatory title of Santa Maria, a small settlement, which is the residence of the governor. It has a fort for its defence against the invasions of the Indians, which is garrisoned by a detachment of troops of the fortified place of Panama, and which is changed monthly. This was the first settlement that was made on the continent    D A R of America, having been founded, in 1509, by the Licentiate Enciso, by the order of Pedrarias Davila, when it obtained tlie name of a city and head of a bishopric ; this being erected here in 1531, and being afterwards translated to Panama. It has since that time been dwindling away by degrees, owing to the badness of its climate, and it is now actually reduced to nothing but a miserable hamlet : and even this has been many times invaded by the Indians, who put to the sword its inhabitants, as was particularly the case in the years 1724 and 1750. The Emperor Charles V. gave it for its arms a golden castle upon a red field ; above the castle a sun of the same metal; and on the sides of it a lion rampant and a crocodile. It is nine leagues from the S. sea, and 25 from Panama, but by land much farther.

[Dartmouth, a town in Elbert county, Georgia ; situate on the peninsula formed by the confluence of Broad and Savannah rivers, two miles from fort James, Dartmouth, which is a mile below Charlotte Fort, which see. The town and fort derive their names from James Earl of Dartmouth, whose influence in the British councils obtained from the king a grant and powers to the Indian trading company in Georgia to treat with the Creeks, for the territory called the New Purchase,   I ceded in discharge of debts due to the traders. This tract contains about 2,000,000 of acres, lying upon the head of the Great Ogechee, between the banks of the Savannah and Alatamaha, touching on the Oconee, including all the waters of Broad and Little rivers. This territory comprehends a body of excellent, fertile land, well watered by innumerable rivers, creeks, and brooks.]

From all the above, as well also from the birds of the chase which abound in its swamps and lakes, such as ducks, geese, peahens, guacharacas, paugies, ringdoves, partridges, pheasants, herons, and pachaes, it not only amply supplies with luxuries this district, but also the other districts, and particularly the capital. On every Friday there is held, on the banks of the river, a regular market throughout the year, and the number of people that come to traffic on these occasions is incredible. It is governed by a lieutenant, who was formerly entitled governor of the province, and afterwards the viceroy of Sante Fe ; and as relates to its ecclessiastical functions, by a schoolmaster and curate, <who was of the religious order of St. Dominic, also by two or three assistants to administer the sacraments in the settlements of Daule, Santa Lucia, and Balsar, as well as in the countryhouses and estates ; the inhabitants altogether amounting to 4000 whites, without mentioning the slaves and people of colour. The capital of this district maintains the same name. Daule, a large and navigable river of the same province, which runs from n. to w. and then turns s. It has its origin in the country and mountains of the Colorados, (coloured Indians); its shores are rendered delightful by the plantains which abound upon them, as well as by the number of estates and gardens belonging to the inhabitants of Guayaquil, and in which are found great quantities of cacao,and all kinds of fruits, of the most      6 D A U excellent quality, the same being carried to that capital. Near the settlement called Balsar, and upon the w. coast, dwell the Mangaches, who are Zambos, (that is to say, descended from a Mulatto man and woman), of cape Pasao, and of the province of Esmeraldas, who have retired here.

It is bounded e. by the river and bay of the same name, and the Atlantic ocean ; on the y. by a line from Fenewick's island, in lat. 38° 29' 30" n. drawn w. till it intersects what is commonly called  

DELAWARE.  [the tangent line, dividing it from the state of Maryland ; on the w. by the said tangent line, passing n. up the peninsula, till it touches the w. part of & the territorial circle ; and thence on the n. by the said circle, described with a radius of 12 miles about the town of Newcastle, which divides this state from Pennsylvania. This state derived its name from Lord De-La- War, who was instrumental in establishing the first settlement of Virginia. It is divided into three counties, Newcastle, Kent, and Sussex ; whose chief towns are Wilmington, Newcastle, Dover, and Lewis. Dover is the seat of government. The number of inhabitants, in 1790, was 59,094, of whom 887 were slaves ; and by the census of 1810, the population amounted to 75,674 souls. 
The e. side of the state is indented with a large number of creeks, or small rivers, which generally have a short course, soft banks, numerous shoals, and are skirted with very extensive marshes, and empty into the river and bay of Delaware. In the _9. and w. parts of this state spring the head waters of Pocomoke, Wicomico, Nanticoke, Choptank, Chester, Sassafras, and Bohemia rivers, all falling into Chesapeak bay ; some of them are navigable 20 or SO miles into the country, for vessels of 50 or 60 tons. 
The state of Delaware, the upper parts of the county of Newcastle excepted, is, to speak generally, low and level. Large quantities of stagnant water, at particular seasons of the year, overspreading a great proportion of the land, render it equally unfit for the purposes of agriculture, and injurious to the health of the inhabitants. The spine or highest ridge of the peninsula runs through the state of Delaware, inclining to the e. or Delaware side. It is designated in, Sussex, Kent, and part of Newcastle county, by a remarkable chain of swamps, from which the waters descend on each side, passing on the e. to the Delaware, and on the zb. to the Chesapeak. Many of the shrubs and plants growing in these swamps are similar to those found on the highest mountains. 
Delaware is chiefly an agricultural state. It includes a very fertile tract of country ; and scarcely any part of the United States is better adapted to the different purposes of agriculture, or in which a great -variety of the most useful productions can be so conveniently and plentifully reared. The soil along the Delaware river, and from eight to 10 miles into the interior country, is generally a rich clay, producing large timber, and well adapted to the various purposes of agriculture. From thence to the swamps above menVOL. II.  tioned the soil is light, sandy, and of an inferior quality. 
The general aspect of the country is very favourable for cultivation. Excepting some of the upper parts of the county of Newcastle, the surface of the state is very little broken or irregular. The heights of Christiana are lofty and commanding f some of the hills of Brandy wine are rough and stony ; but descending from these, and a few others, the lower country is so little diversified as almost to form one extended plain. Jn the county of Newcastle the soil consists of a strong clay ; in Kent there is a considerable mixture of sand ; and in Sussex the quantity of sand altogether predominates. Wheat is the staple of this state. It grows here in such perfection as not only to be particularly sought by the manufacturers of flour throughout the Union, but also to be distinguished and preferred for its superior qualities in foreign markets. This wheat possesses an uncommon softness and whiteness, very favourable to the manufactures of superfine flour, and in other respects far exceeds the hard and flinty grains raised in general on the higher lands. Besides wheat, this state generally produces plentiful crops of Indian corn, barley, rye, oats, flax, buckwheat, and potatoes. It abounds in natural and artificial meadows, containing a large variety of grasses. Hemp, cotton, and silk, if properly attended to, doubtless would flourish very well. 
The county of Sussex, besides producing a con 7 siderable quantity of grain, particularly of Indian corn, possesses excellent grazing lands. Tins county also exports very large quantities of lumber, obtained chiefly from an extensive swamp, called the Indian River or Cypress Swamp, lying partly within this state, and partly in the state of Maryland. This morass extends six miles from e. to w. and nearly 12 from ?t. to s. including an area of nearly 50,000 acres of land. The whole of this swamp is a high and level bason, very wet, though undoubtedly the highest land between the sea and the bay, whence the Pocomoke descends on one side, and Indian river and St. Martin's on the other. This swamp contains a great variety of plants, trees, wild beasts, birds, and reptiles. 
Almost the whole of the foreign exports of Delaware are from Wilmington : the trade from this state to Philadelphia is great, being the principal source whence that city draws its staple commodity. No less than 265,000 barrels of flour, 500,000 bushels of wheat, 170,000 bushels of Indian corn, besides barley, oats, flaxseed, paper^ slitiron, snuff, salted provisions, &c. &c. to a very] c    

DELAWARE.  
[considerable amount, are annually sent from the -waters of the Delaware state ; of which the Christiana is by far the most productive, and probably many times as much so as any other creek or river of like magnitude in the Union ; 245,000 barrels of flour, and other articles, to the amount of 80,000 dollars more, being exported from this creek ; of which, to the value of 550,000 dollars are manufactured on its n. bank, within two or three miles of the navigation. Among other branches of industry exercised in and near Wilmington, is a cotton manufactory, (lately howcver~burnt) ; a bolting cloth manufactory has lately been established by an ingenious European ; both of which have promised fair to be a lasting advantage to the country. In the county of Newcastle are several fullingmills, two snuffmills, one slittingmill, four papermills, and sixty mills for grinding grain, all of which are turned by water. But though Wilmington and its neighbourhood are probably already the greatest seat of manufactures in the United States, yet they are capable of being much improved in this respect, as the country is hilly, and abounds with running water; the Brandy wine alone might, with a moderate expence, when compared with the object, be brought to the top of the hill upon which Wilmington" is situated, whereby a fall sufficient for 40 mills, in addition to those already built, would be obtained. The heights near Wilmington afford a number of agreeable prospects; from some of which may be seen the town, the adjacent meadows, and four adjoining states. No regular account of the births and burials has been kept, but the place is healthy. The number of children under 16 Is probably equal to that of any town which is not more populous, and, according to an accurate account taken the year 1794, there were upwards of 1G0 persons above 60 years old. The legislature of this state, in 1796, passed an act to incorporate a bank in this town. 
There is no college in this state. There is an academy at Newark, incorporated in 1769. The legislature, during their session in January 1796, passed an act to create a fund for the establishment of schools throughout the state. 
Wheat is the staple commodity of this state. This is manufactured into flour, and exported in large quantities. The exports from the port of Wilmington, where a number of squarerigged vessels are owned, for the year 1786, in the^article of flour, was 20,783 barrels superfine, 457 do. common, 256 do. middling, and 346 do. ship stuff. The manufacture of flour is carried to a higher  degree of perfection in this state than in any other in the Union. Besides the well constructed mills on Redclay and Whiteclay creeks, and other streams indifferent parts of the state, the celebrated collection of mills at Brandy wine merit a particular description. Here are to be seen, at one view, 12 merchant mills, (besides a saw mill), having double the number of pairs of stones found in the others, all of superior dimensions and excellent construe, tion. These mills are three miles from the mouth of the creek on which they stand, half a mile from Wilmington, and 27 from Philadelphia, on the post road from the e. to the s. states. They are called the Brandy wine Mills, from the stream on which they are erected. This stream rises near the Welch mountains in Pennsylvania, and after a winding course of 30 or 40 miles through falls, which furnish numerous seats (ISO of which are already occupied) for every species of water works, empties into Christiana creek, near Wilmington. The quantity of wheat manufactured at these mills annually is not accurately ascertained. It is estimated, however, by the best informed on the subject, that these mills can grind 400,000 bushels in a year. But although they are capable of manufacturing this quantity yearly, yet from the difficulty of procuring a permanent supply of grain, the instability of the flour market, and other circumstances, there arc not commonly more than from about 290 to 300,000 bushels of wheat and corn manufactured here annually. In the fall of J 789, and spring of 1790, there were made at the Brandy wine mills 50,000 barrels of superfine flour, 1354 do. of common, 400 do. middling, as many of ship stuff, and 2000 do. corn meal. The quantity of wheat and corn ground, from which this flour, &c. was made, was 308,000 bushels, equal to the export of those articles from the port of Philadelphia for the same year. 
These mills give employ to about §00 persons, viz. about 40 to tend the mills, from 50 to 70 coopers to make casks for the flour, a sufficient number to man 12 sloops of about 30 tons each,, which are employed in the transportation of the wheat and flour, the rest in various other oecupa-; tions connected with the mills. The navigation, quite to these mills is such, that a vessel carrying 1000 bushels of wheat may belaid alongside of any . of these mills ; and beside some of them the wafer. is of sufficient depth to admit vessels of twice the above size. The vessels are unloaded with astonishing expedition. There have been instances of 1000 bushels being carried to the height of four stories in four hours. It is frequently the case]  

DE L  II  
[that vessels with 1000 bushels of wheat come up with flood tide, unlade, and go away the succeeding ebb with 300 barrels of flour on board. In consequence of the machines introduced by the ingenious Mr. Oliver Evans, three quarters of the manual labour before found necessary is now sufficient for every purpose. By means of these machines, when made use of in the full extent proposed by the inventor, the wheat will be received on the shallop's deck, thence carried to the upper loft of the mill, and a considerable portion of the same returned in flour on the lower floor, ready for packing, without the assistance of manual labour but in a very small degree, in proportion to the business done. The transportation of flour from the mills to the port of Wilmington does not require half an hour ; and it is frequently with ease that a cargo is taken from the mills and delivered at Philadelphia the same day. The situation of these mills is very pleasant and healthful. The first mill was built here about 50 years since. There is now a small town of 40 houses, principally stone and brick, which, together with the mills and the vessels loading and unloading beside them, furnish a charming prospect from the bridge, from whence they are all in full view. 
Besides the wheat and flour trade, this state exports lumber and various other articles. The amount of export;? from the year ending September 30th, 1791, was 119,878 dollars, 93. cents; ditto 1792, 133,972 dollars, 27 cents ; ditto 1793, 93,559 dollars, 45 cents; ditto 1794, 207,985 dollars, 33 cents ; ditto 1795, 158,041 dollars, 21 cents. 
In this state there is a variety of religious denominations. Of the Presbyterian sect there are 24 churches ; of the Episcopal 14 ; of the Baptist 7 ; of the Methodists, a considerable number, especially in the two lower counties of Kent and Sussex : the number of their churches is not exactly ascertained. Besides these there is a Swedish church at Wilmington, which is one of the oldest churches in the United States. 
There are few minerals in this state except iron ; large quantities of bog iron ore, very fit for castings, are found in Sussex county, among the branches of Nanticoke river. Before the revolution this ore was worked to a great amount ; but this business has since declined. Wheat and lumber are the staple commodities of this state. The other articles of produce and manufacture, are Indian corn, barley, oats, flaxseed, salted provisions, paper, slitiron, snuff, &c. 
Settlements were made here by (he Dutch about the year 1623, and by the Swedes about the year  
1627. Their settlements were comprehended in the grant to the Duke of York; and William Penn united them to his government by purchase. They were afterwards separated, in some measure, from Pennsylvania, and denominated the Three Lower Counties. They had their own assemblies, but the governor of Pennsylvania used to attend, as he did in his own proper government. At the late revolution, the Three Counties were erected into a sovereign state ; and have established a republican constitution.] 
[Delaware County, in Pennsylvania, is s. ay. of Philadelphia county, on Delaware river. It is about 21 miles in length, and 15 in breadth, containing 115,200 acres, and subdivided into ^townships, the chief of which is Chester. The number of inhabitants is 9483. The lands bordering on the Delaware are low, and afford excellent meadow and pasturage ; and are guarded from inundations by mounds of earth or dikes, which are sometimes broken down in extraordinary freshes in the river. If this happens before cutting the grass, the crop of hay is lost for that season, and the reparation of the breaches is expensive to the proprietors.

==[[Delfin|DELFIN|Dauphin]]==, a small island in the gulf of Mexico, near the coast of W. Florida, 20 miles to the e. of the entrance or mouth of the river Chicasawhay, and in that of the Mobile. It is five miles long and very narrow. In one half of it there are no trees, and in the other but very few. The only fort and settlement that it contains is situate in the w. part of it. Between this island and another about a league's distance, called Del Cuerno, the water is very shallow, and at the extremity of the last mentioned island is another small one, which should rather be looked upon as a rock. This is called Redonda, from its round figure. The rock Delfin was formerly called Massacre, and had upon it many storehouses and small buildings ; in as much as its port offered a greater convenience for the French established here to unlade their merchandise than to carry it on in small craft as far as the Mobile. In a short, time it became well peopled ; and a few years after the French built a fort, so that it became the principal place of the colony ; maintaining this title, not only by virtue of the assistance it received from France, but likewise by the successful'resistance exhibited against the native savages; although these afterward were made (o manifest a very friendly disposition. Some of these Indians established themselves upon the river Mobile, where they cultivated a piece of ground, and lived in amity with the French, preferring them to the Spaniards, with whom they had lived some  time, and notwithstanding that the latter had established a misson amongst them for the purpose of instructing them in religion. The other Indians, bent upon nothing more than enhancing the prosperity of the colony, and thinking that it was not advantageous to raise corn, set about making some plantations of tobacco, which succeeded admirably ; and, indeed, they had an idea that this article was preferable to any found in Virginia. Some time alter an English pirate destroyed and burnt their storehouses, committing, at the same time, incredible cruelties amongst the inhabitants, in the hopes of forcing them to communicate where they might have hidden treasure. The loss sustained on this occasion, which was by far less serious to the king than to individuals, amounted to 80,000 francs ; and after this it was deecmed expedient to fortify the island. The fruits of all the industry and labour manifested on this occasion were entirely lost, owing to a hurricane which happened, and which filled up the entrance of the port by a mountain of sand ; the whole of the island was nearly inundated, and the numbers of cattle that perished were very great. In 1719, the Spaniards endeavoured, for four days following, to take it by surprise, but they found themselves obliged to desist from their undertaking. It is in lat. 30° 18' n. Long. 88° 12' w.

==[[Demerara|DEMERARA]]==, a large river of the province of Guayana and government of Cumana, in the part occupied by the Dutch. Its origin is not for certain known, hut it runs n. between the rivers Essequebo and Corentin, and enters the sea five leagues from the former, having a fort at its mouth. It is navigable only by rafts and canoes. Its shores are covered with plantations and country houses, and the habitations of certain English delinquents and refugees, who pay a tribute to the Dutch for the possession they enjoy. The productions of these estates are sugar, coffee, and cotton, which were sent to Europe under the same regulations as were the productions of the colony of Essequebo : two ships arrive here annually, laden at the charge and risk of the company, in which the inhabitants send back their productions, paying to the same company the expences of freight. This medium is resorted to principally by such inhabitants as cannot risk a vessel upon their own account : the same plan is adopted equally in the other colonies, though there are no inconsiderable number of small vessels used as private traders. [The river Demerara is about two miles wide at its mouth, opposite the fort, on the e. bank of the river, and about 45 miles distant from Abary creek. It is scarcely a mile wide, 12 miles above the fort ; and its course is from s. to 72. It is navigable upwards of 200 miles for vessels which can pass the bar at its mouth, which is a mud bank, not having above 24 feet at the highest tides. The difference between high and low water mark is from 10 to 12 feet. The fort, if properly supplied with men and ammunition, is able effectually to guard its entrance. Staebroeck,  ment, and have the same 4 : court of police, but each has a separate court of justice. The two districts contain about 3000 whites and 40,000 slaves. Demerara river, which gives name to the district, passes through it, and is usually visited by 40 or 50"* large ships from Holland, who often make two voyages in a year, besides upwards of 250 smaller vessels, under the Dutch and other flags. The plantations are regularly laid out in lots along the seashore, called facades, about a quarter of a mile wide, and extending -Jths of a mile back into the country. Each lot contains about 250 acres each ; and when fully cultivated, the proprietor may obtain a similar tract back of the first, and so on in progression. Each lot will contain 120,000 cotton trees, averaging usually half a pound a tree. Such a plantation is reckoned well stocked to have 1^0 Negroes. The shores of the rivers and creeks are chiefly planted with coffee, to the distance of about SO miles from the sea ; thence SO miles farther up, the soil becomes clayey and more fit for sugarcanes. Beyond this, the finest kinds of wood for building, furniture, &c. are cut. The estates on the river have greatly increased and extended themselves since 1796, as well as those on the coast ; and where there was one sugarplantation, there are five now. Pinckard has, therefore, given an erroneous idea about these estates being abandoned. The land on the seacoast is unfit for the produc-- tion of sugar, coffee, and plantains, from the soil being too saline. See Dutch America.

It is 14 or 15 leagues in circumference, lofty, mountainous, and full of woods, abounding in trees of great bulk and height, and having upon its coast many cacao trees. In the mountainous part it has many plantations, and the soil is of an obscure red colour. The figure of this island is very irregular, owing to its having many points running into the sea, and being full of shoals and sandbanks. The centre of it is in lat. 3° 10' s. It is well peopled, and its natives are very dark, bold, and robust. They have large and round heads with short and curly hair, which they dress in various forms, and paint of different colours : their faces are wide and round, and the nose very flat. They are not altogether ugly, although they disfigure themselves with paint, and various things which they hang through their noses and their ears. They are active and very dexterous in the management, of their vessels, which are ingeniously built. These are large and straight, the poop being loftier than any other part, and the whole being adorned with figures of birds, fishes, human heads, either painted or engraved, which, although rudely designed, serve to shew a fanciful invention : it is not known what instruments they employ, iron not being in use amongst them. These vessels or canoes they manage in a very dexterous manner by a species of oars. Their principal arms are lances, swords, darts, and some bows and arrows. The Indians spoken of by William Dampiere, as having come upon him to attack him, resemble these. Their language is clear and distinct, and the token of friendship is manifested by carrying a lar^c stick or bough of a tree upon the head. It is in lat. 30° 10' n. and long. 36° 10' zv.

[==[[Dismal|DISMAL]]==, a swamp in the township of Milton, Lincoln county, district of Maine.] [Dismal Swamp, called the Great Dismal, to distinguish it from another swamp, called Dismal, in Currituck county, is a very large bog extending from n. to s. near SO miles, and from e. to w. at a medium about 10 miles, partly in Virginia, and partly in N. Carolina. No less than five navigable rivers, besides creeks, rise out of it ; whereof two run into Virginia, viz. the s. branch of Elizabeth, and the 5. branch of Nansemond river, and three into N. Carolina, namely, North river, North- West river, and Perquimons ; all these hide their heads, properly speaking, in the Dismal, there being no signs of them above ground. For this reason there must be plentiful subterraneous stores of water to feed so many rivers, or else the soil is so replete with this element, drained from the high lands that surround it, that it can abundantly afford these supplies ; this is most probable, as the ground of the swamp is a mere quagmire, trembling under the feet of those that walk upon it, and every impression is instantly filled with water. The skirts of the swamp, towards the e. are overgrown with reeds, 10 or 12 feet high, interspersed every where with strong bamboo briars ; among these grow here and there a cypress or white cedar, which last is commonly mistaken for the juniper. Towards the s. end of it is a large tract of reeds, which being constantly green, and waving in the    wind, is called the green sea ; in many parts, especially on the borders, grows an evergreen shrub, very plentifully, called the gall bush ; it bears a berry which dyes a black colour like the gall of an oak, whence it has its name. Near the middle of the Dismal, the trees grow much thicker, both - cypress and cedar ; these being always green, and loaded with very large tops, are much exposed to the wind, and easily blown down, the boggy ground affording but a slender hold to the roots. Neither beast, bird, insect, or reptile, approach the heart of this horrible desert; perhaps deterred by the everlasting shade, occasioned by the thick shrubs and bushes which the sun can never penetrate, to warm the earth ; nor indeed do any birds care to fly over it, any more than they are said to do over the lake Avernus, for fear of the noisome exhalations that rise from this vast body of filth and nastiness; these noxious vapours infect the air round about, giving agues and other distempers to the neighbouring inhabitants. On the w. border of the Dismal is a pine swamp, above a mile in breadth, great part of which is covered with water knee deep ; the bottom, however, is firm, and the pines grow very tall, and are not easily blown down by the wind. With all these disadvantages, the Dismal is, in many places, pleasing to the eye, though disagreeable to the other senses. 
This dreadful swamp was judged impassable till the line dividing Virginia from N. Carolina was carried through it, in lat. 36° 28' n. in the year 1728, by order of King George 11. ; although it happened then to be a very dry season, the men who were employed in pushing the line were not altogether free from apprehensions of being starved, it being 10 whole days before the work was accomplished, though they proceeded with all possible diligence and resolution, and besides had no disaster to retard them. 
This swamp is chiefly owned by two companies ; the Virginia company, of which General Washington is one, owns 100,000 acres ; the N. Carolina company owns 40,000 acres. In the midst of the swamp is a lake, about seven miles long, called Drummond's pond, whose waters discharge themselves to the s. into Pasquotank river, which empties into Albemarle sound ; on the n. into Elizabeth and Nansemond rivers, which fall into James river. A navigable canal has been lately dug to connect the navigable waters of the Pasquotank and Elizabeth rivers ; the distance about 14 miles. This canal will pass about a,mile e. of Drummond's pond, and will receive water from it. The canal company are incorporated by the concurring laws of] d 2   DOC   Virginia and N. Carolina. This canal is intended to open an inland navigation from the head of Chesapeak bay, including all the rivers in  
Virgin  to Georgetown in S. Carolina ; and  when the short canal from Elk river to Christiana creek is opened, the communication will extend to Philadelphia and the other ports connected with Delaware river. Such an extensive inland communication must be beneficial in time of peace, and in time of war will be essentially serviceable.] ==[[Dividiban|DIVIDIBAN]]==, an arm of the river Apure, one of the three large streams in which this river divides itself to enter by as many mouths into the Orinoco.

DOGS Island, in Dutch Hondenesland, and so called by William Showten, who discovered it in the S. sea. It is small, low, unfertile, and desert; he gave it this name from finding upon it only two dogs, and a wild herb resembling in taste garden cresses ; it has no other water than the rain, and some brackish marshes discovered in its centre ; it is said in the high tides to be inundated. Some are persuaded that this is the same island that was discovered by Jacob le Mairc in 1616, when he gave it the name of Tiburones. It is in lat. 15° 13' s. and long. 138° 20' aa.

==[[Domingo|DOMINGO]]==, St. or Hispaniola, a large island of the N. sea, one of the two largest of the Antilles, being 170 leagues in length, SO in width at its middle part, and 360 in circumference. It was discovered by Admiral Don Christopher Columbus in his first voyage, in 1492 ; it had at that time, amongst the Indians, the name of Hayti ; and a capital having been built, which was called St. Domingo, all that part of the island near which it was founded was called by the same title, which was afterwards taken by the whole of the island, instead of that of Isabella, which had been given it in honour of Isabel queen of Spain. It is situate in the midst of the islands of Cuba, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico, and separated from the latter merely by a channel ; it extends from 17° 37' to 20° lat. and from 67° 35' to 74° 15' long. Some geographers assert it to be 400 leagues in circumference ; the climate is very hot, but the effect is much moderated by the winds and frequent heavy falls of rain, which render it so damp that most things become putrescent in a very short time ; but though tmsalutary for Europeans, they, when they accustom themselves to it, not only enjoy good health, but longevity, many of them reaching the age of 80 years, and some even to the advanced period of 100. This island, which, after that of Cuba, is the largest of any in America, is also the most fertile and delightful ; is covered with extensive forests of exquisite sorts of wood : of these are the caobas, fustetes, oaks, hacanas, guat/acanes, candefones, capaes, laurels, cedars, oranges, thorns, cavimas, savines, marias, pines, ceibas, mamej/es, copez/es, higuillos, jobos, abnacigos, higueros, ebonytrees, granadillos, cateis, nazarenos, gua- •conejos, and cuernos de buey, and a great number of palms and other trees which produce fine and delicious fruits, such as ananas, bananas, grapes, citrons, lemons, limes, dates, apricots, and others in an infinite variety, and superior to any of the same sort found in the other islands. It also abounds in many kinds of birds, curious for their plumage and note ; and the infinite number of cattle found in the meadows, or, as they are  
DOM 21 here called, the savanas, is incredible ; the hides of these cattle have ever been one of the principal articles of the commerce of this island, and were exported to Europe alone, in the year 1587, to the number of 35,444 ; horses, mules, and asses are not less numerous. It likewise produces an infinite quantify of sugar, indigo, tobacco, cotton, ginger, coffee, tea, amber, &c. with various kinds of medicinal drugs and dyes. The whole of this island is watered and fertilized by many rivers, the principal of which are Ozama, Haina, Nigua, Villegas, Nissao, Ocoa, and Yane ; in short, there can scarcely be found a country so well irrigated^ these rivers are productive of a great quantify of tortoises and other fish. It has many mines of gold, silver, copper, crystal, and talc, which in former times produced great riches, especially those of Ciboo among the most excellent, and from one of which a large piece of gold, weighing 3600 castellanos, was extracted, but lost in the fleet that was so unfortunately wrecked. In 1645, amine of quicksilver was also discovered. The Spaniards, On establishing themselves here, found the Indians so numerous that the bishop of Chiapa, Fr. Barlolome de las Casas, related, (if his account be not exaggerated), that they amounted to upwards of 3,000,000, who being assisted in their labours by the Negro slaves in working at the mines anil cultivating the fruits of the earth, helped to enrich, in the early period, not only those persons who established themselves here, but many other Europeans, to whom the emperor had granted certain possessions. The population after a time decreased, by reason of the influence of the smallpox and measles, which laid waste the settlements in 1666, and which period is still remembered here by the appellation of la tragedia de los seisisy (the tragedy of the sixes) ; thisdecrease of population had, of course, an effect upon a commerce which was otherwise greatly favoured by a multitude of convenient and safe ports found on the coasts throughout the island. The French being driven by the Spaniards from the island of St. Christopher, and being aided by many pirates and adventurers of various nations, who were known by the name of Flibustiers, established themselves here, and were continually persecuted and harassed by the legitimate masters and conquerors, until the king of France, acknowledging them as vassals, nominated a governor, and obtained for them in the peace of Riswick, in J697, that the king of Spain, Charles II. should cede to them that part of the island in which they had established themselves, and which was in fact the  DOMINGO.    V  best and most fertile of the whole. It extended 400 miles in length, and 140 in width, being for the most part mountainous, yet fertile and full of beautiful woods and mines of gold, silver, copper, and iron : these mines are not worked at the present day, the French having rather devoted themselves to agriculture, and the high cultivation of wheat, maize, and other seeds. This part of the island is likewise fertilized by various rivers, some of which are navigable; the principal of its productions is sugar, 60,000 load of which, of 500 lbs. each, are made annually ; indigo is produced in a somewhat less proportion, as also cotton, cacao, ginger, and coffee, these being in the same ratio as those produced in the parts in possession of the Spaniards. In 5726, in the French division there were 100,000 Negro slaves, and 30,000 white colonists; its greatest commerce at that time was in tobacco, with which from 60 to 100 vessels were laden annually. The king of France ceded a part of this territory to a commercial company, their charter having been revoked in 1720, and Ferdinand VI. king of Spain, granted the privilege of trading in this island to a company of Catalonians, with the title of Nuestra Senora de Monserrat, who there made a very lucrative traffic ; but the French having been found gradually to encroach upon the Spanish territory, it was thought fit to draw a line of demarcation to determine the limits of their possessions ; and this accordingly ran from cape Frances to the point Beata, and different detachments of infantry and cavalry were appointed by the President Don Joseph Solano to guard against any future invasions. Wemustomitmuchthatmight be added to this article, a£we wish to confine it within the proportionate limits of a dictionary ; and we therefore refer our readers to those who have written upon the subject, such as the Chronicler Antonio de Herrera, Gonzalo Fernandes de Oviedo, the Father Pedro Xavier de Charlevoix, the French Dominican missionaries, Du Tetre and Labat, and lately the Licenciate Don Antonio Sanchez Valverde, who undertakes to show the value and importance of the part of the island called Hispaniola. The capital of the last mentioned division bears the name of St. Domingo, and that part in the possession of the French, the name of Cape Francois or Frances.

1. General history. — St. Domingo, when first discovered, formed five kingdoms, each, governed by sovereigns called Caciques. The names of these kingdoms were Maqua Marien, Higuay, Maguana, and Xaraguay. The Spaniards had possession of the whole of the island for 120 years. At last, about the year 1630, a handful of English, French, and other Europeans, came and forced them to fight in its defence, and after repeated wars for 50 years, they were forced to divide the island with the French. These latter, being the only survivors of the first freebooters or buccaniers, or having insensibly acquired an ascendancy among them, had, so early as 1640, formed this assembly of individuals, born under the domination of almost all the powers of Europe, into a French colony, under the direction of the general government, first established at St. Christopher's, and afterwards at Martinico. The Spanish part is by far the most extensive and the most fertile ; that of the French the best cultivated. The whole island was ceded to the French republic in the treaty of 1795, but was evacuated by the French troops, and surrendered to the English, under the command of Majorgeneral Hugh Lyle Carmichael, by a convention signed 7th. July 1809. 
2. Physical state. — The following particulars relating to this famous island are founded on the best authority, and many circumstances require a separate view of the two artificial divisions of the island, viz. the French and Spanish territories before they were united under one head. They are both alike in possessing the various productions common to the W. Indies. The European cattle are so multiplied here that they run wild in the woods ; few of these are in the French part, in comparison with the Spanish. 
The two great chains of mountains, which extend from e. to ze. and their numerous spurs, give the island an aspect, at a distance, not so favourable as it deserves. They are, however, the cause of the fertility of the island. .They give source to innumerable rivers, repel the violence of the winds, vary the temperature of the air, and multiply the resources of human industry. They abound with excellent timber, and mines of iron, lead, copper, silver, gold, some precious stones, and even mercury. With respect to the vegetable class in this island, it woald be difficult, even in a work de-]  

DOMINGO.  ("voted to the subject, to express or paint all their majesty. Here arc the mountains of Cibao, Selle, and Hotte, reckoned 1000 fathoms above the level of the sea. In the plains, in the Spanish part, the heat is nearly uniform, but varies in proportion to their distance from the mountains. In the plains the thermometer is sometimes at 99°. In the mountains it rarely rises above 72° or 77°.. There the nights are cool enough to render a blanket not unwelcome ; and there are mountains where even a fire is a very agreeable companion in some evenings. The contrast of violent heats and heavy rams renders St. Domingo humid ; hence the tarnished appearance of almost all metals, however brilliant the polish they may originally have had. This is particularly observable on the seashore, which is more unhealthy than the interior parts of the island. The s. part of the island is pretty much subject to hurricanes, called here southern gales, because they are not attended with such dreadful consequences as the hurricanes in the Windward islands. 
The roads are nothing but paths passable only on foot and on horseback ; and eight leagues a day is very great work, in which space the traveller often does not meet with a single habitation, and must consequently carry with him every necessary for nourishment and lodging. Such is the low state of commerce in the Spanish part, that Don Antonio de Valverde, a native Creole, goes so far as to assert, in his account of the territory, that the commerce in cattle, with the French part, is its only support. The whole island is in general well watered by rivers and brooks without number, but certain spaces are deprived of this advantage. From the formation of the island, their courses are but short, and few of them navigable to any distance. It is generally impossible to conceive, from the tranquil aspect that these rivers usually wear, what they become when they overflow their banks. A river that but now hardly covered the pebbles on its bed, or wet the foot of the traveller, is changed by one tempestuous shower into a flood, menacing all that it approaches ; and should its banks give way, it spreads its watery devastation over the plains. Many of these are infested with alligators. The, only lakes or ponds worth notice are those of Henriquelle and Salt pond ; the former is a great curiosity. See Henriquelle. 
The chief of the islands which surround St. Domingo, part of which belonged to the Spanish part, are Altavele, Saone, Beate, St. Catherine, on the s. side from w. to e. ; Moneand Monique, on the s. e. j Caymite and Gonave, on the w, be*  tween the two peninsulas, and La Tortue, on the n. side, towards the w. end of the island, and that of Avache on the s. side of the s. peninsula. 
3. Ancient divisional line.— The ancient division line which separated the French from the Spanish part of the island extended from the river: Des Anses a Pitre or Pedernales on the s. side, to that of Massacre on the n. side, at the head of the bay of Mancenille, which, together with the large bay which sets up from the w. between cape St, Nicholas and cape Dame Marie, s. w. of the former, and 43 leagues apart, moulds this division of the island into such a figure as can be best comprehended by a view of the map; suffice it to say, that it contains 2,500,000 acres of land, of an extremely fertile soil, presenting an agreeable variety of hills, valleys, woods, and streams. 
4. Spanish jurisdictions.— The cantons or jurisdictions, beginning at the westernmost point of the Spanish frontiers, on the s. coast or narrows, are, Baharuco, possessed by the brigands or fugitive Spanish and French Negroes, who inhabit the mountain of Baharuco, Neyve, Azua, Bani '-or Vani, the city of St. Domingo, and territory dependent thereon, St. Laurent des Mines, Samana, Cotuy, La Vega, St. Yago, Daxabon, St. Raphael, Hinche, Banique, and St. John of Maguana. 
5. Population of Spanish division. — The population of the Spanish part is composed of whites, freed people^ and slaves. There are also a few Creoles resembling the Indians, having long, straight, and black hair, who pretend to be descendants of the ancient natives. They are, however, thought to be descended from a mixture of the aborigines and the Spaniards. There were, however, in 1744, several Indians at Banique, who proved their descent from the subjects of the unfortunate Cacique Henri ; although historical authority afiirms that the whole race was exterminated. 
The freed people are few in number, if compared with the whites, but considerable in proportion to the number of the slaves. The people of colour are excluded from almost all employments, civif as well as military, as long as the colour of the skin betrays its origin ; but the political constitution of the country admits of no distinction between the civil rights of a Avhite inhabitant and those of a free person. Indeed the major part of the Spanish colonists are of a mixed race : this an African feature, and sometimes more than one, often betrays ; but its frequency has silenced a prejudice that would otherwise be a troublesome remembrancer. People of colour are admitted to]  
?A  

OMINGO    [the priesthood without difficulty ; but the Spaniards have not yet brought themselves to make Negro priests and bishops like the Portuguese. Slaves are treated with extreme mildness, and are usually fed as well as their masters. 7V religious principle and an illicit affection tend to their emancipation. A slave can redeem himself at a price fixed by law. Thus the fate of the slave is softened by the hope of freedom, and the authority of the master by the habit of being confounded, in some sort, with those who were the other day in slavery. The laws against slaves are much neglected; those in their favour are very exactly observed. Few of the Creoles can either read or write ; hence the want of social intercourse, which is also augmented by the badness of the roads. Over the whole of the Spanish part of the island, mountains and plains, were spread, in 1798, 125,000 inhabitants; of whom 110,000 were free, and 15,000 slaves ; which does not amount to 40 individuals to one square league. The Spanish Creoles are insensible of all the treasures which surround them, and pass their lives without wishing to change their lot ; while the French portion furnishes threefifths of the produce of all the French West India colonies put together, or more than 10 millions sterling. The dress and mode of living of the Spanish Creoles indicate pride, laziness, and poverty. The capital of itself indicates decay ; little insignificant towns are 1 be seen here and there, with a few colonial settlements, for which the name of manufactories would be too great an honour ; also immense possessions, called hattes, where beasts and cattle are raised with little care, in different degrees of domestication ; as the domestic, the gentle, and the shy. Those called wild or mountaineers, as also the shy, cost the herdsmen, called pioneers and lancers, immense labour and danger in the chase. The hattes are the most numerous sort of Spanish settlements, and of an extent far disproportioned to their utility. Some are several square leagues, and do not contain above 500 head of cattle, great and small. Some are called horsehattes, others cattlehattes, according to the name of the animals they contain ; others used in breeding pigs are called coral's. A small piece of woodland, called venerie, frequently serves as a boundary between the hattes, common to those on both sides of it, and also shelters the cattle from the heat of the sun. The woodland likewise attracts the wild animals, and lessens the labours of the huntsman. In these hattes, the people lodge miserably, and have but poor subsistence. The small provision farms, called canacos, fall generally to the lot of the poorer 2  colonists, or most commonly people of colour, or freed people. 
6. Territorial extent of ditto. — Many circumstances conspired to render this island a place of importance to the Spaniards. It was a key to the gulf of Mexico, a convenient place for their shipping to touch at, an excellent rendezvous for their squadrons and fleets, and an important hold for naval operations of all sorts ; but from the impolitic measures of the government, and the restraints on commerce, it proved rather a burden than an advantage to Hie mother country. 
The Spanish part is computed to contain about 90 leagues in its greatest length from e. to w. 60 leagues in its greatest breadth ; having a surface of about 3200 square leagues. About 400 square leagues of this surface are in mountains, which are generally more capable of cultivation than those in the French part, and have sometimes a soil that disputes the preference with that of the valleys. There remains therefore a fine fertile surface of more than 2700 square leagues, divided into valleys and plains of various lengths and breadths. 
7. Commerce and productions of ditto. — The supply of horned cattle to the French part of the island could not be estimated at less than 15,000 head annually : of which the Spaniards furnished fourfifths. These, at SO dollars a head, and bring* ing them by the Spaniards, could not be less than 450,000 dollars. This formed three quarters of the produce of the colony ; and the impost paid to government was 10 per cent. The number of 200,000 head of cattle is the number in the general census taken by order of the president, in 1780 ; and if we count the cattle exempted from the tribute, they may amount to 250,000, without comprehending horses, mules, and asses, which, with an augmentation estimated since 1780, would make a stock of 300,000 head, and an annual production of 60,000 ; and suppose a fifth part of the young ones perish accidentally, there still remains 48,000. The resources of the colonists are very confined, and their few establishments all below mediocrity. There are but 22 sugar manufactories of any consequence ; the rest being not worth naming ; and even these 22 have altogether but about 600 Negroes. Of these six produce syrup, and some sugar; but the others, which are called trapiches t where animals are employed to turn the mills and press the canes, without shelter in the open air, make nothing but syrup. The whole of this produce is generally used in the colony : small quantities are sometimes sent to Puerto Rico, or to Old Spain ; and the goodness of the sugar has proved that of the soil, but nothing in favour of the ma-]  

DOMIN GO.  fnufacturer. The coffee raised here is excellent ; each tree in a state of bearing will produce, on an average, a pound weight, and sometimes of a quality equal to that of Mocha, yet chocolate is preferred to it. Cotton grows naturally at St. Domingo, of an excellent quality, even without care in stony land, and in the crevices of the rocks. The numerous roots of indigo are only obstacles to the feeble cultivation of the fields, where it grows spontaneously. All these valuable productions have shared the fate of depopulation. Tobacco, says Valverdc, has here a larger leaf than in any other part of America; it grows every where, and equals sometimes that of Cuba or the Havannah. It is as much esteemed as this latter, in the manufactures of Seville, and is even preferable to it in segars. Its cultivation has lately become more general. The kernel of the cocoa nut of St. Domingo is more acidulated than that of (he cocoa nut of Venezuela and Caracas, to which it is not inferior; and experience proves, that the chocolate made of the two cocoas has a more delicate flavour than that made of the cocoa of Caracas alone. 
8, Statistical accounts of the French division. — The French part of St. Domingo, containing 2,500,000 acres, of which 1,500,000 were under high cultivation in 1739, was then divided into 10 jurisdictions, which were subdivided into 52 parishes. The w. jurisdictions are, Port au Prince, St. Mark, Le Petite Goave, and Jeremie ; the n. Cape Francois, Fort Dauphin, and Port de Paix; and those in the s. Les Cayes, St. Louis, and Jacmel. Before the late revolution there were in these parishes about 42,000 white people, 44,000 free people of colour, and 600,000 slaves. Other accounts make them considerably less ; the above, however, is from good authority. The number of deaths during 1789, according to the bills of mortality, were 7121 ; the number of births the same year, 4232. The excess of deaths, 2889, will be the less astonishing, when it is considered, that in the years 1787 and 1788, there had been imported into the colony nearly 60,000 new Negroes. The exports from Jan. 1, 1789, to Dec. 31, of the same year, were 47,516,531 lbs. white sugar ; 93,573,300 brown sugar; 76,835,2191bs. coffee ; 7,004,274 lbs. cotton; 758,628 lbs. indigo; and other articles, as tanned hides, molasses, spirits, &c. to the value of 46,873 livres. The total value of duties on the above exportations amounted to 770,801 dollars, 3 cents. 
9. Chief towns. — Port au Prince is the seat of the French government in this island in time of peace, and a place of considerable trade. Cape 

VOL. II.  
Francois exceeds Portau Prince in the value of its productions, the elegance of its buildings, and the advantageous situation of its port. It is the governor's residence in time of war. The mole, though inferior to these in other respects, is the first port in the island for safety in time of war, being by nature and art strongly fortified. The other towns and ports of any note are, Fort Dauphin, St. Mark, Leogane, Petit Goave, Jeremie, Les Cayes, St. Louis, and Jacmel, which see under their different names. The most ancient town in this island, and in all America, built by Europeans, is St. Domingo, of which an account is given under its proper head. 
10. A summary account of the revolution of the blacks. — The Negroes in the French division of this island have, for several years past, been in a state of insurrection. In the progress of these disturbances, which have not yet subsided, the planters and others have sustained immense losses. We shall here give a summary account of this insurrection. 
The situation of the French colonies early attracted the attention of the constituent assembly ; though at this time all was as tranquil as such a state of oppression would permit. 
The first interference of the national assembly in the affairs of the colonies was by a decree of the 8th of March 1790, which declared, that all free persons, who were proprietors and residents of two years standing, and who contributed to the exigencies of the state, should exercise the rights of voting, which constitute the quality of French citizens. 
This decree, though in fact it gave no new rights to the people of colour, was regarded with a jealous eye by the white planters, who evidently saw that the generality of the qualification included all descriptions of proprietors ; they affected, however, to impose a different construction upon it. The people of colour appealed to common justice and common sense ; it was to no purpose ; the whites repelled them from their assemblies ; some commotions ensued, in which they mutually fell a sacrifice to their pride and resentment. * 
These disturbances again excited the vigilanceof the national assembly : a decree was passed on the 12th day of October 1790, by which the assembly declared, as a constitutional article, " That they would establish no regulations respecting the internal government of the colonies, without the precise and formal request of the colonial assemblies." 
Peace, however, was not the consequence ofj 
E    :*;.,  DOMINGO.  
[this decree. The proprietors, it is true, had obtained a legal right of tyrannizing ; but the unfortunate question still recurred, who should be permitted to exercise that right ? On this head the decree was silent. New dissensions arose; each of the parties covered, under a factious patriotism, the most atrocious designs. Assassination and revolt became frequent. Mauduit, a French officer of rank, lost his life by the hands of his own countrymen. The unfortunate Oge, a planter of colour, who had exerted himself in France in the cause of his brethren, resolved to support by force their just pretensions. He landed in the Spanish territory of St. Domingo, where he assembled about 600 Mulattoes. Before he proceeded to hostilities, he wrote to the French general, that his desire was for peace, provided the laws were enforced. His letter was absurdly considered as a declaration of war. Being attacked and vanquished, lie took, refuge among the Spaniards, who delivered him up to his adversaries. These disturbances still increasing, the national assembly found it necessary, at length, to decide between the contending parties. 
On the 15th of May 1791, a decree was made, consisting of two articles, by the first of which the assembly confirmed that of the 12th of October, so far as respected the slaves in their islands. It is true, that the word slave was cautiously omitted in this document, and they are only characterised by the negative description of " men not free," as if right and wrong depended on a play of words, or a mode of expression. 
This part of the decree met with but little opposition, though it passed not without severe reprehension from a few enlightened members. The second article, respecting the people of colour, was strongly contested : those who were before known by the appellation of patriots divided npon it. It was, however, determined in the result, that the people of colour, born of free parents, should be considered as active citizens, and be eligible to the offices of government in the islands. 
This second article, which decided upon a right that the people of colour had been entitled to for upwards of a century, iifsiead of restoring peace, may be considered as the cause, or rather the pretext, of all the subsequent evils that the colony of St. Domingo has sustained. They arose not indeed from its execution, but from its counteraction by the white colonists. Had they, after the awful warnings they had aln ady experienced, obeyed the ordinances of an assembly they pretended to revere ; had they imbibed one drop of the true spirit of that eenstitutkn to which they  had vowed an inviolable attachment ; had they even suppressed the dictates of pride in the suggestions of prudence; the storm that threatened them had been averted, and in their obedience to the parent state they had displayed an act of patriotism, and preserved themselves from all possibility of danger. 
But the equalization of. the people of colour stung the irritable nerves of the white colonists. The descendants of slaves might have lost the resentments of their fathers; but the hatred of a despot is hereditary. The European maxim allows, " That they never pardon who have done the wrong ; but in the colonies this perversity attains a more monstrous growth, and the aversion to African blood descends from generation to generation. No sooner had the decree passed than deputies from the islands to the national assembly withdrew their attendance : the colonial committee, always under the influence of the planters, suspended their labours. Its arrival in the island struck the whites with consternation : they vowed to sacrifice their lives rather than suffer the execution of the decree. Their rage bordered upon phrenzy : they proposed to imprison the French merchants then in the island, to tear down the national flag, and hoist the British standard in its place. Whilst the joy of the Mulattoes was mingled with apprehensions and with fears, St. Domingo reechoed with the cries of the whites, with their menaces, with their blasphemies against the constitution. A motion was made in the streets to fire upon the people of colour, who tied from the city, and took refuge in the plantations of their friends in the woods : they were at length recalled by a proclamation ; but it was only to swear subordination to the whites, and to be witnesses of fresh enormities. Amidst these agitations the slaves had remained in their accustomed subordination. Nor was it till the month of August 1791, that the symptoms of the insurrection appeared; amongst them. 
A considerable number, both of whites and people of colour, had lost their lives in these commotions before the slaves had given indications of disaffection ; they were not, however, insensible of the opportunities of revolt afforded by the dissensions of their masters : they had learnt that no alleviation of their miseries was ever to be expected from Europe ; that in the struggle for colonial dominion, their humble interests had been equally sacrificed or forgotten by all parties. They felt their curb relaxed by the disarming and dispersion of their Mulatto masters, who had been accustomed to keep them under rigorous discipline.]  

DOMINGO.  f Hopeless of relief from any quarter, they rose in different parts, and spread desolation over the island. If the cold cruelties of despotism have no bounds, what shall be expected from the paroxysms of despair ? 
On the 11th of September 1791, a convention took place, Avhich produced the agreement called the Concordat, by which the white planters stipulated, that they would no longer oppose the law of the 15th of May, which gave political rights to the people of colour. The colonial assembly even promised to meliorate the situation of the people of colour, born of parents not free, and to whom the decree of the 15th of May did not extend. An union was formed between the planters, which, if it had sooner taken place, had prevented the insurrection. The insurgents were every where dispirited, repulsed, and dispersed; and the colony itself preserved from total destruction. By a detree of the national assembly, the 24th of September, the people of colour were virtually excluded from all right of colonial legislation, and expressly placed in the power of the white colonists. 
If the decree of the 15th of May could instigate the white colonists to the frantic acts of violence before described, what shall we suppose were the feelings of the people of colour on that of the 24th of September, which again blasted those hopes they had justly founded on the constitutional law of the parent state, and the solemn ratification of the white colonists ? No sooner was it known in the islands, than those dissensions, which the revolt of the Negroes had for a while appeased, broke out with fresh violence. The apprehensions entertained from the slaves had been allayed by the effects, of the concordat: but the whites no sooner found themselves relieved from the terrors of immediate destruction, than they availed themselves of the decree of the 24th of September ; they formally revoked the concordat, and treacherously refused to comply with an engagement to which they owed their very existence. The people of colour were in arms ; they attacked the whites in the s. provinces ; they possessed themselves of fort St. Louis, and defeated their opponents in several engagements. A powerful body surrounded Port au Prince, the capital of the island, and claimed the execution of the concordat. At three different times did the whites assent to the requisition, and as often broke their engagement. Gratified with the predilection for aristocracy, which the constituent assembly had in its dotage avowed, they affected the appellation of patriots, and had the address to transfer the popular odium to the people of colour, who were contending for  their indisputable rights, and to the few white colonists who had virtue enough to espouse thei r cause. Under this pretext, the municipality of Port au Prince required M. Grimoard, the captain of the Boreas, a French line of battle ship, to bring his guns to bear upon, and to cannonade the people of colour assembled near the town : he at first refused, but the crew, deluded by the cry of patriotism, enforced his compliance. No sooner was this measure adopted, than the people of colour gave a loose to their indignation ; they spread over the country, and set fire indiscriminately to all the plantations : the greatest part of the town of Port au Prince soon after shared the same fate. Nothing seemed to remain for the white inhabitants but to seek their safety in quitting the colony. In the n. parts the people of colour adopted a more magnanimous, and perhaps a more prudent conduct. a They begun," says Mr. Verniaud, " by offering their blood to the whites. ' We shall wait,' said they, ' till we have saved you, before we assert our own claims." They accordingly opposed themselves to the revolted Negroes with unexampled courage: they endeavoured to soothe them by attending to their reasonable requisitions; and if the colony of St. Domingo had ever been preserved to the French na<- tion, it would have been by the exertions of the people of colour. 
After this recital of authentic and indisputable facts, it will not be difficult to form a clear idea of the nature of the insurrection : it is at the present moment far from being concluded, and we refer such readers as would wish to consider it in a more detailed view, to the History of Bryan Edwards and Walton's Hispaniola.

1. The Adelantado Dori Bartolome Columbus, brother to the celebrated Admiral Christopher Columbus, founder of the city of St. Domingo, and which was the first city of the kings of Spanish America, in 1496 ; he governed a short time,- since the changes made by the aJcaldia. mayor Francisco Roldan obliged the Catholic kings to nominate, 
2. Don Francisco Bobadilla, a knight and comendador of the order of Calatrava, nominated  

DOMINGO.  
£9  governorgeneral of the Indies in 1500 ; bis authority was but of short date, since the vexations suffered by the Spaniards and Indians gave tliem sufficient motive for desiring his renunciation ; and in his room was elected, 
3. Don Nicolas de Ovando, native of Caceres in Estremadura, knight and comendador of Lares in the order of Alcantara, a man noted for his virtue, justice, and merit; he came to the government in 1501, but the many complaints raised against him, and which tended to publish the fickleness of his character, with the circumstance of the Queen Isabel having sworn to chastise him for having put to death the Ocique Anacoana, and she having left her decree in charge to Ferdinand, this king divested him of the government in 1508, and commanded him to return to Spain. 
4. The Admiral Don Diego Colon, son of the celebrated Christopher, nominated through the importunities that he had made in order that the situation might be offered to his father ; he succeeded to Nicolas de Ovando as governorgeneral, but not in character of viceroy, as his father was, in 1508. 
5. Rodrigo de Alburquerque, sent with the title of distribudor in the different divisions of Indians to Hispaniora, through the influence of the rivals of the Admiral Don Diego Colon, in 1514; but the vexations he endured were such as to cause him to quit the government in the following year, in 1515.

The opportune and well ordered functions of holy men, thus encharged with the care of new establishments, did credit to their election ; and their government, which lasted till 1518, was deserving of the greatest commendations ; this they were commanded to resign in the same year, and they were succeeded by, 
8. The Licentiate Rodrigo de Figueroa, with  the title of administrator ; but, having begun to show signs of an insatiable avarice, and clamours being raised against him from the extortions practisedagainst the poor Indians as well as against the Spaniards, he was removed from his situation in 1521, and carried as prisoner to Spain. 
9. The Admiral Don Diego Colon, for the second time, until the year 1523.

12. Don Luis Colon, viceadmiral of the Indies, grandson of the former and much renowned Christopher Columbus, who, pleading his rights at court, was declared captaingeneral of Hispaniola, in 1540 ; this dignity he exercised but for a short time, from having ceded it to the crown, in exchange for the dukedom of Veragua and marq'uisate of Jamaica.

Domingo, St. the capital of the former island, is of the same name ; lies in the part possessed by the Spaniards, and was founded by Don Bartolome Colon (or Columbus) in 1494 ; he having given it this name, as it is asserted, in honour of his father ; or, as others are of opinion, from his having arrived here on a Sunday. A great part of this city having been destroyed by a violent hurricane which occurred here, it was removed in 1504 to the spot where it now stands, by the Governor Nicolas de Ovando, cornendador mayor of Alcantara, and founded upon the shore of the river Ozama, where there is a good port, though only fit for small vessels and frigates. The city is large, has many handsome buildings, is of a benign temperature, fertile, and abounding in cattle, and a place of great commerce, though nothing like what it was formerly, it having at one time been the principal colony of America, and the place from whence issued nearly all the great conquerors and settlers who went over to the continent, as likewise the residence of the governorsgeneral. It is the head of an archbishopric, founded by Paul III. in 1547, and previous to that had been a bishopric, established by Julius II. from 1512: it has as suffragans those of Cuba and Puerto Rico. The cathedral church, though small, is a fine piece of architecture, and in it are deposited the bones of the discoverer of this island, the celebrated Admiral Christopher Columbus. It has besides the parish church of Santa Barbara, with two other assistant parish chapels in the suburbs, of the names of San Miguel and San Andres, some convents of the religious orders of St. Francis, St. Domingo, La Merced, a college which belonged to the regulars of the society of Jesuits, a good hospital, and two monasteries of nuns, the one of Santa Clara, the other of Santa Catalina. It is the residence of the president and captaingeneral of the island, and of the tribunal of the royal audience, founded in 151 1. It had once a mint, for the purpose of coining the infinite abundance of metals extracted from its mines ; but this was immediately abolished. It is  DOMING O.  
S3  so beautiful, and has an air of such grandeur, that "Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo had the boldness to gay to the Emperor Charles V. that " there was not a city even in Spain preferable to it, either for the advantage of soil, agreeableness of situation, beauty and disposition of the public places and streets, and pleasantness of its surrounding country ;" lie further added, that " his Imperial Majesty often lodged in palaces far inferior in conveniences, size, and grandeur, to those met with at St. Domingo." This city is situate n. s. on the shore of the river Ozama, as has already been observed ; so that on the s. it is terminated by the sea, on the e. by the river, and on the w. and n. by beautiful and well cultivated fields. The streets are wide and straight, crossing each other at right angles, and the houses are well proportioned, and some of them of a species of marblestone found in the neighbourhood, and others of a mortar, which by the influence of the air and time, becomes as bard as any brick. The ground is sufficiently raised above the level of the sea, and this affords it as it were an impregnable barrier. It is completely surrounded by a wall, which was begun by the archbishop and president Don Alonso de Fuen- Bfayor ; and at a small distance from it is the castle of San Geronimo, which is of a square figure, and a very good fortification. Its arms are a*shield divided horizontally ; in the superior half a key ; in the inferior the cross of St. Domingo, sustained by two lions rampant ; and above is the imperial crown. In 1551, the English, commanded by William Gauson, attempted to take it with a strong squadron, and with upwards of 2000 men, who disembarked here. But appearing off the back of the city, they were espied by a battery, which had been built thereto guard against a similar invasion ; and this playing upon tiie English troops with very heavy shot, caused immense havoc ; it is asserted also that the crawfish, with which the island is overrun, being alarmed at the noiseof the firing, made such a clamour that the English being persuaded that it was evidently the troops of the garrison that were coming out against them, immediately betook themselves to flight, and readily reembarked, though with very great loss, especially as they were at the same time attacked by a body of cavalry. In 1586, however, the English succeeded in their attempts of sacking it ; and in 1591, the greater part of it was destroyed by the shock of a tremendous earthquake. It is the native place of many illustrious men, and amongst the rest, of the Friar Alonso de Espinosa, of the order of St. Domingo, a celebrated writer.  
70L. II.  
The city lies 42 leagues from the head of the island, called Saona. 
[St. Domingo is situated on the w. bank of the Ozama, a league below the mouth of Isabella river, in which distance it is 24 feet deep, having a bottom of mud or soft sand, and banks 20 feet perpendicular height ; but ??. of the city this height is reduced to four feet. The Ozama is navigable for 9 or 10 leagues, and has several sugar manufactories, tile kilns, and provision farms on its banks. The road before the mouth of the Ozama is very indifferent, and lies exposed from w. s. w. to e. it is impossible to anchor in it in the time of the s. winds ; and the n. winds drive the vessels from their moorings out into the sea, which here runs extremely high. The port of St. Domingo is magnificent in every respect ; a real natural bason, with a great number of careenings for the vessels that can get at them. There is a rock at the entrance, which will only admit vessels drawing 18 or 20 feet water ; which it is asserted might be removed without great difficulty. 
The plan of the city is a trapezium of about 54© fathoms on the e. side, along the Ozama ; near 500 fathoms on the s. bordering on the sea ; and of about 1800 fathoms in circumference. To the w. and to the n. of the city, the land is rough and rocky for about half a league, but after that it becomes good, and the country delightful. Towards the sea the site of the city lies very high, which forms an insurmountable dike against the fury of the waves. It is surrounded with a rampart eight feet in diameter, and about 10 feet high. There is a great deal of ordnance at St. Domingo, particularly cast ordnance, but the fortifications are not strong; and the height of the Ileignes commands it entirely ; and its efown is not more than 250 fathoms from the ditch. The streets are spacious, and straight as a line, Avhich gives it a pleasing appearance. Ten of these streets run from n. to s. and 10 others from e. to w. The greatest part of the houses, first built, are of a sort of marble found in the vicinity, and in the style of the ancient towns of Spain and Italy : those of a more recent construction are of tapia, a sort of pise. To erect these buildings, a case is made of planks, between pillars of masonry: this case is filled by degrees with a reddish clay, which is rammed down as it is thrown in, until it forms a solid, or sort of wall between the pillars. The clay thus pressed together acquires an amazing hardness, and the walls are sometimes so solid and strong, that the pillars of masonry are useless. 
The houses of St. Domingo are tolerably hand-] 
F   34  [some, in a simple style, and nearly uniform. A considerable part of these, built within these 15 years, are of wood, covered with the leaves or taclies of palm trees. The roofs are generally platformed, being shaped so as to conduct the rainwater to the cisterns. The climate of the capital is, happily, very temperate. The nights of those months which answer to the winter in Europe, are even found to be cold. 
Among a number of public edifices that merit attention in this declining city, we may reckon the ruins of the house that Diego, son of Christopher Columbus, had begun, entirely of hewed stone. The walls are yet remaining, and some of the sculpture round the windows. The roof and ceilings are fallen in, the lower floor is become a penn for cattle, and a Latin inscription over the portal is now hidden by the hut a of herdsman. The cathedral, of the same sort of stone as the house of Diego Columbus, stands on the s. e. Opposite its entrance is a fine spacious oblong square, at the 5. w. end of which is the townhouse. The cathedral is a noble Gothic pile, begun in 1512 and finished in 1540, and was constructed after the model of a church at Rome. It merits admiration on account of the boldness of its vault, which, notwithstanding the ravages of earthquakes in its neighbourhood, has never, till within these 15 or 20 years, had a single flaw. The dust of Columbus rested within this pile until 1796, when it was removed . 
The population of the city of St. Domingo, is not very considerable, yet it is extraordinarily augmented since the year 1780. The census lately taken amounted to 20,000, of every age and sex : but this is far below the exact number. The census is taken by the Spanish priests or vicars, and who go from house to house to verify those who do not perform their paschal duties. This list does not comprehend children under seven years of age, nor heads of families absent from their home or from the city. But the principal cause of the inexactness is, one half of the parochial territory of the city is on the outside of the walls. 
This territory comprehends the part called the Plains, a great part of the Monte de Plate, and again, as well to the e. as to the w. of the city, a very considerable number of country seats and provision habitations, where there are a great many families of blacks, of people of colour, and white cultivators ; so that there are always 5 or G000 not included in the census. 
Notwithstanding the declining situation of the Spanish territory of the island, it is far mpre pros-   perous than it was 70 years ago. A census of 1737 shows, that the total population at that time did not surpass 6000 souls, and the capital contained hardly 500. 
The Spanish capital is 70 leagues e. by s. of Port au Prince ; the road runs half the way along the seacoast, through Bany, Azua, and Neybeji and thence by the lakes Henriquelle and Brackishpond. In this route you have to cross two large rivers, Nisai and Ney be, besides 1 ] smaller streams. It is 90 leagues s. e. of cape Francois, going by the road through St. Raphael, Azua, &c. and about 100 leagues by that of Dahabon, St. Yague, and La Vega. Lat. 18° 28' ». Long. 69° 50' w.

==[[Dominguillo|DOMINGUILLO]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Loxa in the kingdom of Quito. ^ ==[[Dominica|DOMINICA]]==, an island of the N. sea, one of the Smaller Antilles, called thus from its having been discovered on a Sunday by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage. It is the last of the Caribes, lying to the leeward, and 15 leagues to the e. of those islands. It is 13 leagues in breadth, nearly the same in length, and 30 in circumference; although the Father Labat allows it to be no more than 30. It is divided, as are the islands of Guadalupe and Martinique, into Cabesterre and Basseterre. It is, generally speaking, mountainous ; so much so that the author just mentioned doubts whether in the part of Cabesterre there can be found three leagues of plain territory. In the roads, however, of the mountains are most beautiful trees, and all kinds of European fruits and vegetables ; so that it is fertile in every thing produced in the Caribes. Rochefort says, that there are in its centre inaccessible rocks, inhabited by vipers and venomous insects, and snakes of a frightful size. In the part of Cabesterre are many rivers of delicious water, abounding with excellent fish, also a mountain or mine of sulphur. In the part of Basseterre are only two or three scanty villages, the principal of which is called La Gran Sabana,. situate in the centre, and where are produced maize, bananas, some cotton, indigo, cacao, and tobacco ; and in greater abundance partridges, pigeons, turkeys, and pigs of two sorts, the one brought from France, the other from Spain. In the waters here are found some very large and well tasted eels ; but these are not eaten by the Caribes Indians, who are the inhabitants of this village, and who having retired from the other islands in flying from the Spaniards, have rendered this well peopled. Indeed, in 1700, the Father Labat said that the number of Indians here amounted to 2000, including women and children. The French, who more than any other nation, have frequented f2    DOMINICA.  this island, experience a better reception from the natives than do any other foreigners ; but they have nevertheless not been able to establish themselves here but with considerable difficulty, and after a great lapse of time. All around tiiis island the anchorage is good, but there is neither port nor bay, and the only protection for vessels is here and' there behind a cape. The French have ever been uneasy lest the English should establish themselves here, since in wartime they might thus lose the communication between Martinique and Guadalupe ; and notwithstanding that they, the English, have desired it much, and that the governor of Barbadoes calls himself also governor of Dominica, they have no establishment whatever here, and only come here to cut wood and take in water, and are even then much harassed by the  Caribes Indians. These, in 1640, formed a treaty with the French, and held the former in perfect abhorrence, in as much as they pretended to land here with a large fleet under the pretext of friendship, and carried away their people for slaves. These Indians had anciently a cacique or ruler of the whole island ; and when they came to be on good terms with the French, the same ruler was Captain Bucon. This chief made many incursions against the English inhabiting the other islands. In this island, says the Father Labat, are found amongst the sands some small stones, which are called eyestones, from their quality of cleaning any dirt from those organs; but they gain this title not for any chemical virtue, but through their figure, which is of a very small and smooth lens, which, being put under the eyelid, and moved gently round, causes whatever is in the eye to drop out. mominica lies between lat. 15° 10' and 15° 36' 30f *. and between long. 61° 17' and 61° 32' w. ; being about 29 miles in length from Crab point s. to the n. w. cape of Agusha bay on the n. and nearly 16 miles broad from Raymond bay e. to Couhnaut on the w. ; and contains 186,436 acres of land, and is divided into 10 parishes, viz. St. John, St. Andrew. St. Peter, St. Joseph, St. Paul, St. David, St. George, St. Patrick, St. Luke, and St. Martin. The island contains many high and rugged mountains, interspersed with fertile valleys, and is watered by upwards of 30 rivers, beside a number of rivulets. Several of the mountains' contain unextinguished volcanoes, which frequently discharge vast quantities of burning sulphur. Here are several hot springs, esteemed efficacious in removing tropical disorders. Some of the waters are said to be hot enough to coagulate an egg. Here are vast swarms of bees, which produce a great quantity ot wax and honey ; they hive in the trees, and are  thought to have been transported from Europe the native bee of the W.Indies being a smaller species, unprovided with stings, and very different in its manners from the European. The forests afford an inexhaustible quantity of rose wood, so esteemed by cabinetmakers. The fruits and other productions are similar to those in the jieighbouring islands ; but the soil being generally thin, is more adapted to the rearing of cotton than sugar. Dominica, from its local situation, between Martinico and Guadalupe, is the best calculated of all the British possessions in that part of the world, for securing to her the dominion of the Charaibean sea. 4 A few ships of Avar in Prince Rupert's bay would effectually stop all intercourse of the French settlements with each other, as not a vessel can pass but is liable to capture, by ships cruising off that bay, and to windward of the island. It is a separate government and a free port. The legislative authority is vested in the commander in chief, a council of twelve gentlemen, and an assembly of 19 members. The governor's salary, exclusive of his fees of office, is 1300/. sterling, payable out of the four and a half per cent, duties. 
Dominica was discovered Nov. 3, 1493; was ceded to the British crown in 1763 ; was taken by the French in the late war, and restored to Britain at the peace of 1783. Previous to its cession in 1763, it was deemed a neutral land, but was in fact occupied and settled by many French intruders, who, to the number of about 800, were permitted to remain ; 343 Frenchmen then becoming lessees, and holding 10,541 acres of the British crown. These lessees were generally engaged m coffeeplantations, which, in 1787, returned 18,149 cwt. of coffee, and which have been since extended to the produce of 40,000 cwt. and may be further so in this great island to a considerable amount. The country is so rugged and the soil generally (but with exceptions) so unfit for sugar, that although 90,346 acres were sold and apportioned, on Dominica coming under British sovereignty, it had not in 30 years reached to the average produce of above 6000 hogsheads of sugar yearly. In the report of the privy council on the slave trade, in 1788, the British property vested here is estimated at 100,000 taxed acres of patented estates, and the number of Negroes is computed at 22,083, at 50/. each Negro. The value of exports, according to the current London prices in 1788, amounted to 302,987/. 155. sterling, including exports to the American states, value 7164/. 5s. The cargoes in 162 vessels consisted of 7 1,302 cwt. 1 qr. 21 lbs. of sugar ; 63,392 gallons of rum ; 16,803 gallons ot molasses; 1194 cwt. 3 qrs. 21bs. cacao; 18, 149 cwt.]

==[[Dorado|DORADO]]==, a spacious province and country, called also Coropa, or Nueva Estremadura. All that is said by others concerning it, of its riches and mountains of gold, as well as of the grand city of Manoa, founded on the shore of the lake Parime, are merely fables taken from the imaginary relations of Juan Martinez, and from whom the Spaniards have borrowed them, and from the latter strange historians, who have borne testimony to them in their histories and geographical charts. In this spacious and unknown country dwell many barbarous nations of Indians, amongst which some place Las Amazonas, but of all of them there is but little certain information. Here are large rivers which flow down from the mountains, and run from n. to w. many of which together form the great lake of Parime, which is not imaginary, as was formerly thought ; and from this lake run out some other rivers on the n. e. and e. side, and others on the s. and s. e. and there enter the Maranon or Amazonas, the former running into the Atlantic. This fable of the Dorado, or Golden Land, has made many anxious to find it, and it has been the cause of the loss of very many individuals ; first of Gonzalo Pizarro, who, for the sake of discovering it, left Peru with a fine army in 1541, and who, after a long and tedious peregrination returned only by a miracle with a very few of his companions. Its discovery was successively attempted by Pedro Ordaz from Quito, Antonio Berrio, sent from the Nueva Reyno de Granada, by Gonzalo Ximenez de Quesada, Francisco de Orellana, Felipe de litre, Pedro de Ursua, all of whom met with the 2  same disastrous fate as the former ; these being succeeded with no better fortune by the English under Waller Raleigh in 1545, as also by another person, called Reimisco, in the following year, 1516: all these repeated misfortunes began at last to make people believe that there was really no such thing as the Dorado, or Golden Land, in existence ; and although the Father Joseph Gumilla, of the extinguished company of the Jesuits, corroborates its existence in the history he has written of the Orinoco, no doubt of its falsity at present remains ; since the journeys made into the country by the Dutch colonists of Berbice and Surinam, and by the Capuchin missionaries of Guayana, by the religious Franciscans of the missions of Piritu, as also made by several officers, who under instructions for the purpose arrived as far as the lake Parime, bear witness to the same assertion; and since, moreover, the truth may be easily seen by reference to the history of Nueva Andalucia, written by the Father Fr. Antonio Caulin, and printed in 1779. Dorado, a river of the province and government of Tucuman, in the jurisdiction of Salta. It runs n. forming a curve, and enters the river Del Valle. 

==[[Dorchester|DORCHESTER]]==, a county of the province and colony of Maryland in N. America ; one of the five which compose this province. It is situate to the s. of the Talbot. The parish and capital, where also is held the assembly, bear the same name. This is a small town, having little more than a dozen houses. The territory which lies to the n. of the river Nantilkoke, from the mouth of that of Chickacoan up to its source, and from there to the arm of the Anderton, as far as the wastewater or arm which it throws out to the n. w. and to the mouth of the aforesaid Chickacoan, was declared by an act of the assembly, in 169S, to belong to Panquash and Annatouquem, two caciques or Indian chiefs, and to their heirs and successors, with the condition of paying annually one castorskin by way of tribute. In this country are more settlements of Indians than in any other.

[Durango, Intendancy of. This intendancy, better known under the name of New Biscay, belongs, as well as Sonora and Nuevo Mexico, to the JProvincias Internets Occidentales. It occupies a greater extent of ground than the three united kingdoms of Great Britain, and yet its total population scarcely exceeds that of the two towns of Birmingham and Manchester united. Its length from s. to n. from the celebrated mines of Guarisamey to the mountains of Caraay, situated to the n. w. of the Presidio de Yanos, is 232 leagues; its breadth is very unequal, and near Parral is scarcely 58 leagues. 
The province of Durango, or Nueva Biscaya, is bounded on the s. by La Nueva Galicia, that is to say, by the two intendancies of Zacatecas and Guadalaxara ; on the s. e. by a small part of the intendancy of San Luis Potosi, and on the w. by the intendancy of Sonora ; but towards the n. and especially the e. for more than 200 leagues, it is bounded by an uncultivated country, inhabited by warlike and independent Indians. 
The struggle with these Indians, which has lasted for centuries, and the necessity in which the colonist, living in some lonely farm, or travelling through arid deserts, finds himself of perpetually watching after his own safety, and defend ing his flock, his home, his wife, and his children against the incursions of wandering Indians; and, in short, that state of nature which subsists in 'the midst of the appearance of an an-  cient civilization, have all concurred to give to the character of the inhabitants of the n. of New Spain, an energy and temperament peculiar to themselves. To these causes we must, no, doubt, add the nature of the climate, which is temperate, an eminently salubrious atmosphere, the necessity of labour in a soil by no means rich or fertile, and the total want of Indians and slaves who might be employed by the whites for the sake of giving themselves up securely to idleness and sloth. In the Provincias Internas the development of physical strength is favoured by a life of singular activity, which is, for the most part, passed on horseback. This way of life is essentially necessary, from the care demanded by the numerous flocks of horned cattle, which roam about almost wild in the savannas. To this strength of a healthy and robust body, we must join great strength of mind, and a happy disposition of the intellectual faculties. Those who preside over seminaries of education in the city of Mexico, have long observed that the young people who have most distinguished themselves for their rapid progress in the higher sciences were, for the most part, natives of the most n. provinces of New Spain. 
The intendancy of Durango comprehends the n. extremity of the great tableland of Anahuac, which declines to the n. e. towards the banks of the Rio Grande del Norte. The environs of the city of Durango are still, however, according to the barometrical measurement of Don Juan Jose d'Oteyza, more than 2000 metres, or 6561 feet, elevated above the level of the ocean : this great elevation appears to continue til! towards Chihuahua, for it is the central chain of the Sierra Madre, which near San Jose del Parral runs in a direction n. n. w. towards the Sierra Verde and the Sierra de las Grullas, 
The population, in 1803, amounted to 159,700, and the extent of surface in square leagues was 16,873. 
There are reckoned in La Nueva Biscaya one city, (Durango), six towns, (Chihuahua, San Juan del Rio, Nombre de Dios, Papasquiaro, Saltillo, and Mapimi), 199 villages or settlements, 75 parishes, 152 farms, 37 missions, and .400 cottages or ranchos. 
The most remareablc places are, Durango, Chihuahua, San Juan del Rio, Nombre de Dios, Pasquiaro, Saltillo, Mapimis, Parras, San Pedro tie Batopilas, San Jose del Parral, Santa Rosa de Cosiguiriachi, Guarisamey, which see.]

[DUTCH America. The only possession which the Seven United Provinces, lately called the Batavian Republic, held on the continent of America, was the province called Dutch Guayana. The islands in the W. Indies which belonged to the republic were St. Eustatius and Curacoa, the small island of Saba near St. Eustatius, and the islands Bonaire and Aruba ; which are appendages to Curacao, and chiefly improved in raising cattle and provisions for that island. 
Dutch Guayana, in South America, is bounded n. by the Atlantic ocean; e. by Cayenne; s. by an unexplored country, called Amazonia; w. by Orinoco, a Spanish settlement. It lies between l?tt, 5° and 7° n. extending along the coast from the mouth of Orinoco river to the river Marowyne. These settlements were esteemed by Admiral Rodney, who captured them in 17S0, as an acquisi-   tion of more value to the British empire than all their West India islands. It is divided into three distinct governments, viz. Surinam, Berbice, Essequebo, and Demerara. The two last are two districts, forming one government. A number of fine rivers pass through this province ; the chief of which are Essequebo, Surinam, Demerara, Berbice, and Canya. Essequebo is 21 miles wide at its mouth, and is more than 300 miles in length. The others are navigable, and are described under their different names. The chief towns are Paramabiro and Staebroeck. 
In the months of September, October, and November, the climate is unhealthy, particularly to strangers. The common diseases are putrid and other fevers, the dry bellyache, and the dropsy. One hundred miles back from the sea you come to quite a different soil, a hilly country, a pure, dry, wholesome air, where a fire sometimes would not be disagreeable. Along the seacoast the water is brackish and unwholesome; the air damp and sultry. The thermometer ranges from 75° to 90° through the year. A n. e. breeze never fails to blow from about nine o'clock in the morning through the day in the hottest seasons. As the days aud nights throughout the year are very nearly of equal length, the air can never become extremely heated, nor the inhabitants so greatly incommoded by the heat, as those who live at a greater distance from the equator. The seasons were formerly divided regularly into rainy and dry ; but of late years so much dependence cannot be placed upon them, owing probably to the country's being more cleared, by which means a free passage is opened for the air and vapours. The water of the lower parts of the rivers is brackish and unfit for use ; and the inhabitants are obliged to make use of rain water, which is here uncommonly sweet and good. 
About 70 miles from the sea, on the river Surinam, is a village of about 40 or 50 houses, inhabited by Jews. This village, and the town* above mentioned, with the intervening plantations, contain all the inhabitants of this colony, which amount to 32Q0 whites aud 43,000 slaves. The buildings on the plantations are many of them costly, convenient, and airy. The country around is thinly inhabited with the native Indians, a harmless, friendly set of beings. They are, in general, short of stature, but remarkably well made, of a light copper colour, straight black hair, without beards, high cheekbones, and broad shoulders. 
In their ears, noses, and hair, the women wear ornaments of silver, &c. Both men and women go naked. One nation or tribe of them tie the lower]  

DUTCH AMERICA  
{"part of the leg of tbe female children, when young, with a cord bound very tight, for the breadth of six inches above the ancle, which cord is never afterward? taken off but to put on a new one ; by which means the flesh, which should otherwise grow on that part of the leg, increases the calf to a great size, and leaves the bone below nearly bare. This, though it must render them very weak, is reckoned a great beauty by them. The language of the Indians appears to be very soft. They are mortal enemies to every kind of labour ; but nevertheless manufacture a few articles, such as very fine cotton hammocs, earthen waterpots, baskets, a red or yellow dye, called roucau, and some other trifles, all of which they bring to town, and exchange for such articles as they stand in need of. They paint themselves red, and some are curiously figured with black. Their food consists chiefly of fish and crabs and cassava, of which they plant great quantities, and this is almost the only produce they attend to. They cannot be said to be absolutely wandering tribes ; but their huts being merely a few cross sticks, covered with branches, so as to defend them from the rain and sun, they frequently quit their habitations, if they see occasion, and establish them elsewhere. They do not shun the whites, and have been serviceable against the runaway Negroes. 
On each side of the rivers and creeks„are situated the plantations, containing from 500 to 2000 acres each, in number about 550 in the whole colony, producing at present annually about 16,000 hhds. of sugar, 12,000,000 lbs. coffee, 700,000 lbs. cocoa, 850,000 lbs. cotton: all which articles (cotton excepted) have fallen off of late years, at least onethird, owing to bad management, both here and in Holland, and to other causes. Of the proprietors of these plantations not above 80 reside here. In the woods are found many kinds of good and durable timber, and some woods for ornamental purposes, particularly a kind of mahogany, called copic. The soil is perhaps as rich and as luxuriant as any in the world ; it is generally a rich, fat, clayey earth, lying in some places above the level of the rivers at high water, (which rises about eight feet), and in most places below it. Whenever, from a continual course of cultivation for many years, a piece of land becomes impoverished, (for manure is not known here), it is laid under water for a certain number of years, and thereby regains its fertility, and in the meantime a new piece of woodland is cleared. This country has never experienced those dreadful scourges of the West Indies, hurricanes ; and   droughts, from the lowness of the land, it has not to fear; nor has the produce ever been destroyed by insects or by the blast. In short, this colony, by proper management, might become equal to Jamaica or any other. Land is not wanting; it is finely intersected by noble rivers and abundant creeks ; the soil is of the best kind, it is well situated, and the climate is not very unhealthy, and is growing better, and will continue so to do, the more the country is cleared of its woods and cultivated. 
The rivers abound with fish, some of which are good ; at certain seasons of the year there is plenty of turtle. The woods abound with plenty of deer, hares, and rabbits, a kind of buffalo, and two species of wild hogs, one of which (the peccary) is remarkable for having something like its navel on the back. 
The woods are infested with several species of tigers, but with no other ravenous or dangerous animals. The rivers are rendered dangerous by alligators from four to seven feet long, and a man was a short time since crushed between the jaws of a fish, but its name is not known. Scorpions and tarantulas are found here of a large size and great venom, and other insects without number, some of them very dangerous and troublesome ; the torporific eel also, the touch of which, by means of the bare hand or any conductor, has the effect of a strong electrical shock ; serpents also, some of which are venomous, and others, as has been asserted by many credible persons, are from 25 to 50 feet long. In the woods are monkeys, the sloth, and parrots in all their varieties ; also some birds of beautiful plumage, among others the flamingo, but few or no singing birds. 
The river Surinam is guarded by a fort and two redoubts at the entrance, and a fort at Paramaribo but none of them of any strength, so that one or two frigates would be sufficient to make themselves masters of the whole colony ; and never was there a people who more ardently wished for a change of government than the inhabitants of this colony. The interior government eonsists of a governor and a supreme and inferior council; the members of the latter are chosen by the governor from a double nomination of the principal inhabitants, and those of the former in the same manner. By these powers, and by a magistrate presiding over all criminal affairs, justice is executed, and laws are enacted, necessary for the interior government of the colony ; those of a more general and public nature are enacted by the directors, and require no approbation here by the court. 
The colony is guarded farther by about 1G00 re-1   48    
[gular troops, paid by the directors. These troops, together with a corps of about 250 free Negroes, paid by the court here, and another small corps of chasseurs, and so many slaves as the court thinks fit to order from the planters from time to time, are dispersed at posts placed at proper distances on a cordon, surrounding the colony on the land side, in order, as far as possible, to defend the distant plantafions, and the colony in general, from the attacks of several dangerous bands of runaway slaves, which from very small beginnings have, from the natural prolificacy of the Negro race, and the continual addition of fresh fugitives, arrived at such an height as to have cost the country very great sums of money and much loss of men, without being able to do these Negroes any effectual injury. 
This colony was first possessed by the French as early as the year 1630 or 40, and was abandoned by them on account of its unhealthy climate. In the year 1650 it was taken up by some Englishmen, and in 1662 a charter was granted to Charles II. About this time it was considerably augmented by the settlement of a number of Jews, who had been driven out of Cayenne and the Brazils, whose descendants (with other Jews) compose at present one half of the white inhabitants of the colony, and are allowed great privileges. In 1667 it was taken by the Dutch, and the English having got possession about the same time of the then Dutch colony of New York, each party retained its conquest ; the English planters most of them retired to Jamaica, leaving their slaves behind them, whose language is still English, but so corrupted as not to be understood at first by an Englishman. At present this colony is in the possession of the British.] 

[DUTCHESS County, in New Nork, is on the e. side of Hudson river. It has the state of Connecticut on the e. West Chester on the si and Columbia county on the n. It is about 48 miles long and 23 broad, and contains 15 townships, of which Poughkeepsie and Fishkill are the chief. It contains 45,266 inhabitants ; of these 6013 are qualified to be electors, and 1856 are slaves. Dutchess county sends seven representatives to the assembly of the state. In the year 1792, a remarkable cavern was discovered in this county, at a place called by the Indians Sepascot, at Rhynbeck. A lad, by chance, passing near its entrance, which lies between two huge rocks, on the declivity of a steep hill, on prying into the gloomy recess, saw the top of a ladder, by which he descended about 10 feet, and found himself in a subterraneous apartment, more capacious than he  chose to investigate. He found, however, that it had been the abode of persons, who probably during the war had taken shelter here, as bits of cloth and pieces of leather were scattered about its floor. It since appears to be divided by a narrow passage into two apartments ; the first being about 17 feet in length, and so low that a child of eight years old could but just walk upright in it; the breadth is about eight or ten feet. The second between 12 and 14 feet in length, but much higher and broader than the first. Like many other caverns in the United States, it possesses a petrifying quality; and the water, which is constantly percolating through the roofs of its apartments, has formed a variety of transparent and beautiful stalactites. They have the appearance of icicles, and may be broken off by the hand, if not more than two inches in circumference. But what is most to bs admired is the skeleton of a large snake turned into solid stone by the petrifying quality of the water before mentioned. It was with some difficulty torn up with an axe from the rock it lay upon, and is now in the possession of the gentleman who explored the cavern. A want of free air was experienced in the inmost recesses of the cavern, by a difficult respiration, though the candles burnt very clear. The air also was very warm.]

It abounds in excellent fish, and in its district live some Indians, Airicos, Achaguas, and Chitanos.

==[[Elena|ELENA]]==, S. Point of, a district of the province and government of Guayaquil in the kingdom of Quito. It is a long strip of land or point of the coast which runs into the sea for half a league, and is thus called from having been discovered by Francis Pizarro on the day of this saint, in 1525. It is of the most benign, mild, and healthy temperature of any district in the province, and is resorted to for the cure of infirmities ; it abounds, in flesh and fish, but it wants both fruits and vegetables, and the only water it has, is extracted from some very deep wells, save that which flows from a stream out of a rock ; the one and the other are, however, well tasted and salutary ; and it is to this that is attributed the very advanced period of life to which the natives arrive, the same being in general 80 years ; indeed in 1735, no less than seven persons of quality were living at the great  a<re of 100 years, and one who had completed ISO. They are for the most part robust, agile, and dexterous in hunting. This district produces much salt, neat cattle, and mules, wax and thread of caracol, from all which productions it carries on a great commerce ; it likewise produces and trades largely in black sealingwax, which is made of a resin called cascol. Here is also found bitumen of Copey, with which ismixedaAjrwftranornaptha, translucent or sparkling lime, used for giving a lustre to walls : the way of taking the wax is as follows : Some liquid honey is smeared upon the branches of trees in some dark mountain groves on some fine sunshiny day, and the odour is sure to entice the bees, who come to sip it; thus the natives are enabled to watch and follow them back to their hives, whether they be in the ground, when they are called amonanas, or whether they be on the branches of trees, when they are called moquinganas; thus they take the wax, exposing it immediately to the sun and air, to purge it of all dross, though at the same time making turpentine of the useless matter. The thread caracol consists of cotton dyed with a white juice expressed by the hands from some snails or insects called caracolitlos, which are found in the hollows of the rocks ; it thus takes immediately a most beautiful purple colour, and which, however washed, will never fade, although it will in time get somewhat lighter : the said insect being replaced in the hollow of the rock, regains its former properties, but after frequent using, at last dies. There is a tradition that this district was inhabited by giants, and there are found some vast sepulchres, out of which have been taken some bones of an astonishing size, all of which bore evident symptoms of having belonged to the human frame; and in 1735, Don Juan del Castillo a serjeantmajor of the batallion of militia of the city of Guayaquil, brought to Quito a perfect human tooth weighing five pounds, and which, according to the certificate which he made, was extracted from a jaw of three quarters of a yard in length ; he brought also a piece of bone, which to all appearance was that which unites the arm to the wrist, the same being twothirds of a yard in thickness.

The island is extremely narrow at this place, having the unfathomable Atlantic ocean on the one side, and a shallow, smooth, and white sea on the other. The scenery near this part of the island is of a most magnificent description. The storms of the Atlantic have forced their way through a large arch in the rock, and have carried towards the opposite side of the island, fragments of rock of a great magnitude. The view of the Atlantic ocean through this tremendous opening, and the whole of the wild scenery about it, is of a description seldom to be met Avith. There is no approaching it on the e. side, and from its difficult access and remote situation, it is seldom visited. Upon the b. side of Eleuthera is the settlement of Wreck Sound, containing, 1803, about 400 inhabitants, including Negroes; to the n. of this, (and on the same side of the' island), there is another small settlement at Governor's harbour ; and at the n. zo. extremity of the island is the settlement of Spanish Wells, which contained at the same period about 120 inhabitants, including blacks. But the largest settlement belonging to Eleuthera, and where the parish church is situated,        £6    is at Harbour island, at the n. extremity : this island has been long settled by a race of people of a description and manners considerably distinct from those of the inhabitants who removed to the Bahamas about the close of the American war ; they live chiefly upon fish ; their village, containing in 1803 about 560 whites and 330 blacks,, is "beautifully situated upon the s. side of the island, in front of the harbour, to which there is an entrance at each end, but only for vessels of small draft of water. 
The mainland of Eleuthera is upon the opposite side of the harbour, and the inhabitants repair to that side for the purpose of cultivating fruit, and other vegetable productions, the soil there being better adapted for it than upon Harbour island : this latter island is considered to be the most healthy of all the Bahamas, and a small barrack was on that account erected there in 1803, for the convalescents of the garrison from New Providence. 
The number of acres granted by the crown for the purpose of cultivation, previous to May 1803, amounted to 12,785. It is contained between lat. 24° 39' and 25° 31' n. and between long. 76° 22' and 76° 56' a>.]

Esmeraldas, or Atacames, a province and government of the kingdom of Quito; situate between the two jurisdictions of Guayaquil and Barbacoas, on the coast of the S. sea ; bounded by the province of Popayan at the settlement of Usmal, which is the line of division which on the s. separates it from the district of Guayaquil; on the w. by the provinces of Quito and Ibarra, it is 56 leagues in length, enjoys different temperatures, is very fertile, and abounds in all kinds of productions ; the principal of which, and such as in which it traffics, are wax, copal, balsams, tar, pitch, bainilla, achote, brambles, the herb of which indigo is made, tobacco, and cacao of a most excellent quality, and such as is esteemed even above that of Guayaquil. In its mountains grow the most exquisite sorts of woods. It is watered by several rivers; the principal of which are the Mira and the Santiago. These rivers are navigable, and upon their shores and in their creeks there is found washed up in their sand a considerable portion of gold ; the same having, in all probability, been rubbed off from some of the many mines of this metal which these waters lave. The said mines, when worked, have produced, on account of their advantageous situation, more riches than even the mines of Barbacoas. This province abounds greatly in cattle, and has likewise mines of excellent emeralds, and from this circumstance it takes its name. It was, as it were, uncultivated and neglected, through ignorance of its fertility and riches, until the same were discovered by Sebastian de Benalcazar, who also succeeded in subduing it. In 1621, its government and population surrendered to the Captain Pablo Durango Delgadillo; at the same time stipulating or obliging itself to suffer a pass to be opened through it as a communication to the other    provinces of Rey. This communication, however, was never put into effect, neither by the present conqueror nor by Francisco Perez Menacho, who obtained the same favour in 1626. Neither was the object obtained by Vicente Justiniani, a short time afterwards, nor by Don Hernando de Soto Calderon, in 1713, until that the king granted the government to Don Pedro Maldonado y Sotomayor, a gentleman of the bedchamber, an illustrious American, and a native of Quito. He indeed was the true discoverer of these treasures in 1746; and his early death, which occurred in London, deprived the state of services which would eventually have succeeded in making this one of the most opulent and flourishing colonies of America, considering the advantages it possesses, and which he had not failed to increase, having been busied already in opening a road of connection to it from Quito, but which is at present entirely abandoned. He also founded various settlements, in order to establish its commerce in the five seaports which it possesses, and of which the principal or capital is Limones. 
Esmeraldas, with the dedicatory title of San Mateo, a settlement of the former province and government ; situate on the coast of the S. sea, on a long strip of land which forms the mouth of the river Guaillabamba, on the shores of which, at no great distance from the sea, it was first founded ; but it was afterwards removed for the convenience of a port, which is now much frequented by vessels which come to lade with the produc- " tions of this province.

==[[Espana|ESPANA]]==, Nueva, a spacious kingdom of N. America, the limits of which towards the n. are not known. It runs in length, from n. to s. from the port of Acapulco, in the Pacific, to the last settlements in the n. ; being 670 leagues long and 1300 wide in the upper part, from the river of St. Lawrence or Canada, in the N. sea, to the province of Los Apaches, on the s. coast, at its narrowest part, and where it forms the bay of Mexico, which is the distance between the port of Vera Cruz and that of Navidad in the S. sea. It is only 280 leagues across ; and its territory forms in its figure here the gulf or bay called Campeche, from the cape of Florida to that of Coteche, in the province of Yucatan. It runs from n. w. to s. e. forming, as it were, an isthmus obliquely between the two seas, from lat. 14° to 19° between the e. and s. points, and then extends itself as far as the cape Tiburon and river of Congos, where it is bounded by the provinces of Tierra Firme. This extensive country was discovered by Francisco Fernandez de Cordoba, through the province of Yucatan, in 1515, and was conquered and added to the dominions of the king of Spain by the renowned Hernan Cortes, Marquis del Valle, native of Medellin, in Estrem ad lira, in 1521. The whole of it is governed by a viceroy, who is also a captaingeneral, whose government extends beyond that of any other monarch. In his district is an archbishopric and nine bishoprics suffragan to the same ; these are as follows : The Puebla de los Angeles, Oaxaca, Durango, Guatemala, Mechoacan, Antequera, Guadalaxara, Yucatan, and Chiapa. Here are three royal audiences, which are established in Mexico, Guadalaxara, and Guatemala ; and in these are contained the provinces of Cinaloa, Culiacan, Chiametlan, Xalisco, Mechoacan, Mexico, Tlaxala, Oaxaca, Nueva Vizcaya, Zacatecas or Nueva Galicia, Guadalaxara, Nuevo Leon, Guastecaor Panvico, Soconusco, Chiapa, Tobasco, Yucatan, Vera Paz, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costarica, and California; the samebe-   ingdivided into the following 128 alcaldias mat/ores, governments, and corrcgimicntos :  Acapulco,

All these are divided into 235 curacies and 23 missions, many of them, or indeed the greaterpart, having been founded and established by the regulars of the extinguished company of Jesuits; the same being now under the charge of the monks of the order of St. Francis and of those of St. Domingo. This kingdom is watered by many large rivers, and an infinite number of small ones, which rise from innumerable springs ; it produces nearly all the fruits of the known world, such as wheat, garvansas or Spanish peas, lentils, rice, flax, vines of the stunted and branching sorts, olives, maize, French beans, beans, barley, and many other fruits, not to mention wax, silk, pepper, saffron, and cinnamon, although the quality of the two latter are somewhat inferior, owing to the want of cultivation : it abounds in cacao, balsams, resins, and medicinal herbs ; also in sugar, honey, and sweetmeats, which are made in abundance; in purple, cochineal, and other dyes ; in cotton, of which the finest and most excellent manufactures are made; in cattle of the large and small sort and of every species, as neat cattle, mares, sheep, and swine ; and all of these in such abundance, that although they were originally brought from Europe, they are now in sufficient numbers to supply other countries and kingdoms as large as itself; likewise the number of native animals, as well terrestrial as aerial and aquatic, is very great, and the variety of their species astonishing. By all these productions, and by an infinite quantity of others, which it is not allowable for us to enumerate in the limits of our article, it maintains a very large commerce, and may be looked upon as one of the richest, most opulent, and flourishing kingdoms in the whole world. It contains 35 reales or silver mines, not to mention many others which have been, as it were, abandoned,owing to the great expence of labour ; from all of them, however, have been extracted, and are now actually extracted, immense riches, and there are not wanting mines of gold, copper, lead, tin, iron, and steel; although these yield but inconsiderably. 
When this country was entered by the Spaniards, 

VOL. II,  it was governed by an emperor, who was elective, and who was called Motezuma, and to whom many other kings, the rulers of an infinite number of nations, Avere tributary; their subgovernments comprehending many millions of idolatrous and superstitious Indians. The most numerous nations were those of the Mexicanos, and those of the Tlaxcalticas, who formed a republic independent of the aforesaid emperor : with all their barbarism they acknowledged the laws and principles of civil life ; they had a knowledge of agriculture and of the arts ; they adored different idols, the principal of which was Huitzilputzil, and to this they sacrificed as well as to many others, all of which had their respective temples, and were different amongst the thousand different tribes of Indians. 
These are valorous, and were not unacquainted with the stratagems and arts of war, having much harassed the Spaniards in the conquest of this kingdom. There are indeed at the present day many vast nations and provinces which could never be reduced, and in which reside many apostolic missionaries, who are continually making proselytes to the Catholic faith, though not without great labours, and even hazard of their lives, many haying already perished in their laudable pursuits. This kingdom, to which the Spaniards gave the name of Nueva Espana, from the similarity they thought it to possess to their native country, enjoys, equally with that, climates that are cold, temperate, and warm : it has suffered various plagues, when thousands of Indians have perished, as particularly in that which happened in 1545, when no less than 800,000 fell a prey to its ravages ; also in that of 1756, which lasted nearly half the following year, and when more than 2,000,000 died; and this, without mentioning the frequent and distressing ravages of the smallpox, which disorder was known here before the arrival of the Spaniards: its population consists at present of these, of Mustees, Mulattoes, Indians, free Negroes, and slaves who are employed in labour.

1 . Population. — The first observation that strikes us on the perusal of the work of Humboldt, and other recent works on Nueva Espana, is the great and rapid improvement of that kingdom within the last 30 years. 
The rapid increase of its population appears from the registers of births and burials ; these are   IS  E S P A N A.  
[kept in many places with great accuracy by the parish clergy, whose emoluments depend, in part, on the casualties arising from baptisms and funerals. Through the favour of the archbishop of Mexico, Mr. Humboldt had free access to these collections ; the result of his examination was, that the proportion of births todeathsthroughout the kingdom, is as 170 to 100; in some parts of the tableland of Mexico, the proportion was as high as 253 to 100 ; but at Panuco, on the coast of the N. sea, it was as low as 123 to 100 : this difference arises from the great salubrity of the tableland in the centre of Nueva Espana, compared with the low, marshy lands upon the coast. Mr. Humboldt justly remarks, that the salubrity of tropical climates depends more on the dryness of the air, than on any of its other sensible qualities. The burning province of Cumana, the coast of Coro, and the plains of Caracas, prove that excessive heat alone is not unfavourable to human life. It would seem, on the contrary, that in very hot but dry countries, mankind attain to a greater age than in the temperate zones. One extraordinary instance of this longevity is related by Humboldt, as having occurred within his own observation : while he was at Lima, a Peruvian Indian died at the age of 147 : having been married for 90 years to the same woman, who had lived to the age of 117 ; till he attained to the age of 130, this venerable personage used to walk three or four leagues every day, but for the last 12 years of his life he had lost his sight. Many instances of similar longevity are related in the Mercurio Peruano. 
Butthe tableland of Mexico, which constitutes threefifths of the kingdom, enjoys not only a dry and light atmosphere, but a mild and temperate climate ; the winters are as gentle as at Naples ; the medium temperature of that season is from 13° to 14° of the centigrade thermometer : sometimes, indeed, though rarely, the thermometer descends below the freezing point ; but in the greatest heat of summer, it never rises in the shade above 24°. On the coast, the medium temperature of the whole year is, on the contrary, about 25° or 26° ; and wherever the air is moist as well as hot, the climate is exceedingly unwholesome : this is the case upon the n. coast of Mexico, from the mouth of the river Alvarado to the river Tampico, and plains of New Santander ; and the s. coast is equally unhealthy, from San Bias to Acapulco. The combination of heat and moisture in the atmosphere, in like manner, renders the coast of Caracas unwholesome, from New Barcelona to Puerto Caballo.  
The population of the whole viceroyalty of Nueva Espana, as calculated by Mr. Humboldt from the proportion of births and deaths given by the parish registers, and from an actual enumeration of the inhabitants made in 1793 by the Count of Revillagigedo, viceroy of the kingdom, amounted at that time to 4,483,559 souls ; and in 1808, to 7,800,000. From an examination of the re. gisters of different parishes, he ebtimates the proportion of births to the whole population as one to 17, and that of deaths as one to 30 ; and he finds the number of male births to be greater than that of females, in the proportion of 100 (o 97, which is somewhat less than the proportion observed in France. Our readers are probably aware of the extraordinary fact, that the number of females born in Chile greatly exceeds that of males, in the proportion, as some accounts state, of two to one. 
The tithes, which are collected from all sorts of agricultural produce, have doubled in their amount in 24 years, and he describes the general face of the country as indicating the rapid progress and extension of its agriculture. Fields brought recently into cultivation, country houses building or lately erected, populous, rising, and industrious villages, are the objects which meet the eye of the traveller in every direction in which he crosses the country. 
2. Increase of taxes, roads, SfC — Another indication of the growing prosperity of Nueva Espana, is the. increasing productiveness of the taxes levied on its internal trade and consumption : to this fact, as to the former, Mr. Humboldt bears witness in general terms ; and it is found in the Viagero Univeral, t. 27, p. 11, that the duty of alcabala in the kingdom of Nueva Espana, which, from 1766 to 1778 inclusive, yielded only 19,844,054 dollars, produced, in the same number of years, from 1779 to 1791 inclusive, 34,218,463f dollars ; making a difference in favour of the second period, of 14,374,409. The alcabala is a tax of 6 per cent, on commodities sold in the interior of the country, and exacted as often as the sale is repeated. Its productiveness is consequently the best indication possible of the briskness of internal trade. 
Nothing more sensibly contributes to promote the industry and prosperity of a country, than the construction of roads for its internal commerce ; and no stronger proof can be given of its flourishing and improving state, than the multiplication of these means of communication. Thus we find in Mexico, that the magnificent carriageroad from the capital to Vera Cruz, which had reached no further than Puebla, in 1795, has been carried,]   E S P A N A.  ffbr some years past, as far as Perote, and is now, at the instance of the merchants of Vera Cruz, conducted in part down the mountains to that city. A road was also made, in 1800, across the isthmus of Tehuantepec, from the river Huasacualcoto the river Chimalapa, for the purpose of conveying the indigo of Guatemala to Vera Cruz. Other roads have also been constructed in the interior of the kingdom. ;'_ „ 
3. Mines.— But the great and rapid progress ol Nueva Espana is nowhere so strikingly exemplified as in the increasing productiveness of its mines: it is a vulgar error /long since refuted by Ulloa, that the labour of the mines has been a principal cause of the depopulation of Spanish America: were that occupation more unwholesome than it really is, the number of persons employed in it is not sufficient to produce any sensible effect on the general population of the country. The mines of Nueva Espana are at this moment the most productive of any that were ever worked in any country, at any period of history ; and yet the whole number of persons employed in working these mines under ground, does not exceed 30,000, or one twohundredth part of the whole population of the kingdom. Some of the occupations connected with mining are more laborious, and less favourable to health, than the employments of agriculture; but the choice of such occupations is voluntary, for, in Mexico at least, the labour of the miner is perfectly free, his wages are high, in proportion to the unwholesomeness., disagreeableness, and severity of his work ; and he is secure from bad usage, as he is at liberty to quit his master and employment when he pleases, and may hire himself, if he chooses, at another mine. The mita tanda, or forced labour of the Iridians, has been abolished in Mexico for at least 40 years ; Robertson was in error when he supposed that it still existed. The circumstances of the principal Mexican mines are favourable to the health and accommodation of the miners : instead of being situated in barren mountains, adjoining to the limits of perpetual snow, like the mines of Potosi, Pasco, and Chota, in Peru, the richest and most abundant mines of Nueva Espafia are  not more than 1700 or 2000 metres above the level of the sea, in the midst of cultivated fields, cities, and villages ; affording, in abundance, all that can be wanted for the use of the mine or convenience of the miner. It is accordingly found, that the mortality in the mining districts of Mexico, is not greater than in other parts of the kingdom. An examination of the parish registers of Guanaxuato and Zacatecas, which are the seats, of the two principal mines of Nueva Espana, has convinced Mr. Humboldt of this truth ; he found, that in Guanaxuata the number of births from 1797 to 1802 was, to the number of deaths, as 201 to 
But, if the labour of the mines is not that scourge of humanity, which well meaning but ill informed writers have imagined, there can be no boubt of the propriety of stating the increased productiveness of the mines as one of the symptoms of the growing prosperity of the country. An increase of the produce of the precious metals tends, no doubt, to a depreciation of their value ; but this objection, which has been urged in Europe, against the further working of the American mines, would apply, with equal force, against the extension of any branch of agriculture or manufactures : every increase of supply tends to diminish the value of the article produced ; but the natural corrective of this evil, when it becomes one, is the reduction of profit to the grower or manufacturer* who will abandon his trade or occupation as soort as he finds that he can no longer carry it on with advantage. But so far is the trade of mining from having arrived at this state in America, that at no period since the discovery of that continent, have there been so many opulent individuals engaged in mining, or such quantities of the precious metal* extracted annually from the mines. In the kingdom of Nueva Espana, in particular, the improvement of the mines has been rapid and considerable, as will appear from the following table, which gives the average of the annual coinage of Mexico, during successive periods, from 1732 to near the present time, extracted from the registers of the mint.

The first six rows of figures in the preceding table, are calculated from data furnished by the Mercurio Peruano, vol. x. p. 133.; the seventh is extracted from the same work, vol. xi. p. 13; and the last calculated from a statement furnished by Espinosa, director of the caxa deconsolidation, or sinking fund, at Madrid. As very little bullion is exported from Mexico, the amount of the coinage is, in general, very nearly equal to the amount of the produce of the mines ; occasionally, however, it is less. In 1790, one million and a half of dollars were remitted, in bullion, to the king from Yera Cruz. It is unnecessary to point out the great increase of the annual produce of the precious metals, and particularly of silver, since 1771 : the facts stated in the table speak plainly for themselves. 
It will surprise the generality of our readers, to be told that the silver mines of Nueva Espafia, the most productive of any that have been ever known, are remarkable for the poverty of the mineral they contain. A quintal, or 1600 ounces, of silver ore, affords, at a medium, not more than three or four ounces of pure silver : the same quantity of mineral, in the silver mines of Marienberg in Saxony, yields from 10 to 15 ounces. It is not, therefore, the richness of the ore, but its abundance, and the facility of working it, which render the mines of Nueva Espana so much superior to those of Europe. 
The fact of the small number of persons employed in the labour of the mines, is not less contrary to the commonly received opinions on this subject. The mines of Guanaxuato, infinitely richer than those of Potosi ever were, afforded, from 1796 to 1803, near 40,000,000 of dollars in gold and silver, or very near 5,000,000 of dollars annually ; that is, somewhat less than one fourth of the whole quantity of gold and silver from Nueva Espana :  yet these mines, productive as they were, did not employ more than 5000 workmen of every description. The labour of the mines is perfectly free in Mexico, and no species of labour is so well paid ; a miner earns from 25 to 30 francs a week, that is, from five to five dollars and a half; while the wages of the common labourer are not more than a dollar and a half. The tenateros, or persons who carry the ore on their backs from the place where it is dug out of the mine, to the place where it is collected in heaps, receive six francs for a day's work of six hours. No slaves, criminals, or forced labourers, are ever employed in the Mexican mines. 
Mr. Humboldt, who is well acquainted with the mines of Germany, points out many defects and imperfections in those of Nueva Espana : one of the most obvious is the clumsy, imperfect, and expensive mode of clearing them from water ; in consequence of which, some of the richest mines have been overflowed and abandoned; another great defect is the want of arrangement in the disposition of the galleries, and absence of lateral communications, which add to the uncertainty, and increase prodigiously the working of the mines. No plan of the galleries is formed, and no contrivances used for abridging labour, and facilitating the transport of materials. When new works are undertaken, they are often begun without due consideration, and always conducted on a scale too large and too expensive. 
More than threefourths of the silver obtained from America, is extracted from the ore by means of quicksilver : the loss of quicksilver in this operation is immense ; the quantity consumed in Nueva Espana alone is about 16,000 quintals a year, and in the whole of America, about 25,000 quintals are annually expended ; the cost of which, in the colonies, Mr. Humboldt estimates at]    £ S P A N A.  [6,200,000 livres. The greater part of this quicksilver has been furnished of late years by the mine of Almaden in Spain, and the residue was obtained from Istria in Carniola ; in 1802, Almaden alone supplied more than 20,000 quintals. Huencavelica in Peru, which in the I6th century afforded for some years more than 10,000 quintals of quicksilver a year, does not yield at present quite 4000 : such being the case, it comes to be a question of infinite importance to America, how its mines are to be provided with quicksilver, if the supply from Spain and Germany should be cut off. Humboldt seems to be of opinion that there are mines of cinnabar in America, sufficient for the purpose ; he enumerates several in Nueva Espana and Nueva Granada, as well as in Peru; bat till they are worked or examined with greater care than they have been hitherto, it is impossible to judge what quantity of mercury they are capable of yielding. It is the supply of mercury that determines the productiveness of the silver mines ; for such is the abundance of the ore both in Mexico and Peru, that the only limit to the quantity of silver obtained from those kingdoms, is the want of mercury for amalgamation. The sale of quicksilver in the Spanish colonies has been hitherto a royal monopoly, and the distribution of it among the miners a source of influence, and possibly of profit, to the servants of the crown. Gulvez, to whom America is indebted for the system of free trade, reduced the price of quicksilver from 82 to 41 dollars the quintal, and thereby contributed most essentially to the subsequent prosperity and increase of the mines. 
The annual produce of the mines of Nueva Espana, as calculated from the amount of the royal duties, and therefore considerably under the truth, amounts to 7000 Spanish marks of pure gold, and 2,250,000 do. of pure silver ; the value, in dollars, of both is 22,170,740; the gold being estimated at 145^1 dollars, and the silver at 9-^ dollars, the Spanish mark ; besides this we must add for contraband 829,260 dollars, and the total produce will then be 23,000,000.

Agriculture and productions. — The backwardness of agriculture in Spanish America, has been usually attributed to its mines of gold and silver: this error Mr. Humboldt successfully refutes ; he admits, that in some districts, as in Choco and other parts of New Grenada, the people leave their fields uncultivated, while they mispend their time in searching for gold dust in the beds of rivers. It is also true, that in Cuba, Caracas, and Guatemala, where there are no mines, many highly cultivated tracts of country are to be found ;  but, on the other hand, the agriculture of Peru is not inferior to that of Cumana or Guayana ; and in Mexico, the best cultivated district is the territory extending from Salamanca to Guanaxuato and Leon, in the midst of the most productive mines of the world. So far from mining being prejudicial to agriculture, no sooner is a mine discovered and wrought, than cultivation is seen in its neighbourhood ; towns and villages are built ; provisions are wanted for the workmen, and subsistence for the cattle employed in the mine : whatever the surrounding country can be made to produce, is raised from it in abundance. A flourishing agriculture is established, which not unfrequently survives the prosperity of the mines, to which it was indebted for its origin ; the husbandman remains and cultivates his fields, after the miner, who had at first set him to work, is gone to another district, in search of a more abundant or less exhausted vein. The Indians, in particular, who prefer a mountainous situation to living in the plains, seldom quit the farms they have established, though the mines are abandoned, which Were, perhaps, their original inducement for settling there. Indian villages and farms are continually found in the valleys, and amidst the precipices of the highest mountains. In the same manner, the agriculture of Lombardy and Flanbers continues to flourish, though the manufacturing industry of these countries has been long extinguished. 
In his account of the agriculture of Nueva Espana, Mr. Humboldt enters into many curious and interesting details concerning the origin, natural history, and cultivation of the different vegetable productions of that kingdom, in which our limits will not permit us to follow him : we shall, therefore, confine ourselves to a few extracts from this part of his work. 
Of all the vegetable productions cultivated for the use of man, there is none which affords so much food from the same quantity of land, as the plaintain or banana tree : a field of 100 square metres, in plantain trees affords 4000 lbs. weight of food ; the same field in wheat will produce about SO lbs. ; and in potatoes 90 lbs. The quantity of food from the plantain tree is, therefore, to the quantity of food from wheat as 133 to one, and to the quantity from potatoes as 44 to one : the quantities of nourishment, it must be owned, are not proportioned to the weights, for the fruit of the plantain tree contains a greater portion of mucilaginous juice than the seeds of the cerealia. An arpent, covered with plantain trees, will maintain 50 persons : the same quantity of ground]    70  

ESP AN A.  
[sown with wheat will not support two individuals. The plantain tree does not thrive where the medium temperature is below 24° (centign. therm. or 75°.2'F.), but there are 50,000 square leagues of the Mexican territoiy in that situation. The fruit of the plantain tree is farinaceous, but contains a small portion of vegetable gluten, and a great quantity of saccharine matter. Mr. Humboldt remarks, that in all tropical countries, saccharine matter is considered to be eminently nutritious. "." '. 
The same country that affords the plantain tree produces the cassava root; the farina of the cassava root, called manioc, is made into bread, which the natives, to distinguish it from the bread of maize, call pan de tierra caliente. The flour of manioc has this inestimable advantage, that, when dried and toasted, it is secure from the depredations of worms and other insects : it contains, besides farinaceous fecula, a saccharine matter, and a viscous substance resembling caoutchouc. The cassava root is not cultivated in Nueva Espana at a greater height than 600 or 800 metres above the level of the sea ; its poisonous juice becomes harmless by boiling, and separating the scum that rises to the top, and is then used by the natives for seasoning their food. The original inhabitants of Haite, after the conquest of their country by the Spaniards, used to poison themselves with this juice, and for that purpose assembled in parties of 50 or more to take it together. 
Maize is the chief food of the inhabitants of Nueva Espana : it is cultivated from the coast to the height of 2800 metres above the sea ; in very fertile lands, and in very good years, it gives a return of 800 for one ; but the average return tor the intratropical part of the country is not more than ^50 for one, and in New California it is from 70 to 80 : in very hot and moist districts two or three crops are obtained in the year, but in most parts of the country only one is taken. No crop is more uncertain than maize, and as it is seldom equally good in every part of the kingdom, the transport of maize comes to be the principal branch of internal commerce i a general failure of the crop is followed by scarcity, or even famine : its price varies from two livres and a half to 25 livres the faneea, and when it exceeds 10 livres for a length of time, the common people are forced to use other and less wholesome nourishment. The annual produce of Nueva Espana in maize is estimated at 17,000,000 of fanegas annually. It may be preserved for three years at Mexico, and in colder climates for six or seven years. The Indians prepare a fermented liquor from maize, and  before the arrival of the Spaniards, they extracted sugar from its stalks. 
It appears, that a species of wheat and a species of barley were cultivated in Chile before the arrival of the Spaniards, but that noneof the ccrealia of the old continent were known in America when it was first discovered. The cerealiaarenot cultivated in the intratropical part of Mexico, at a lower elevation than 800 or 900 metres above the level of the sea, and in very small quantity at a less height than 1200 or 1300. At a greater elevation than 3500 or 4000 metres, neither wheat nor rye come to maturity, though the medium temperature of these regions is higher than in parts of Siberia and Norway, where both plants are cultivated with success: but then, the heat in the the latter countries is very great for a month or six weeks in the middle of summer ; while, in the former, the thermometer never rises for a whole day above 10° or 12° (50° or 52°.6 F.) The Mexican wheat is of excellent quality, and the medium return throughout the kingdom is from 22 to 25 for one : in some places it gives from 30 to 40 for one ; and in New California, only 17 or 18. Much wheat is exported from Vera Cruz to Cuba : barley and rye thrive very well in Nueva Espana ; oats are very little cultivated ; the potato is a great object of culture in the high and cold parts of the country : rice is but little attended to, though well adapted for the marshy lands on the coast. 
The Spanish government has always discouraged in its colonies the cultivation of the vine, the olive, the mulberry tree, and the plants producing hemp and flax. While Humboldt was in Nueva Espana, an order came from Madrid to grub up all the stocks of vines in the «. part of the kingdom, where they had been cultivated with so much success as to give alarm to the merchants of Cadiz, by the diminished consumption of wine from the mother country. There is but one olive plantation in Nueva Espana, and that belongs to the archbishop of Mexico : tobacco is another branch of culture, which has been in a great measure sacrificed to political considerations. Since 1764, when the royal monopoly was established, no tobacco can be planted, except in particular districts, and none can be sold, except to the king's officers. Parties of soldiers are employed to go about the country in search of tobacco fields ; and where they find one on forbidden ground, they impose a fine on the owner, and direct the plantation to be destroyed : this odious and vexatious monopoly produces to the king of Spain, in Mexico alone, a clear revenue of more than 20,000,000 of livres annually.]   A N Al

[Pulque, or fermented liquor, is prepared from the sap of the American aloe : it is the favourite drink of all the nations that speak the Aztetic tongue. It tastes like cider, but has an offensive smell of meat in a state of putrefaction. The ardent spirit distilled from it is strictly prohibited by law, lest it should interfere with the sale of Spanish brandy ; but great quantities of it are clandestinely made. The pita also furnishes thread ; and the ancient Mexicans prepared from it a sort of paper. Next to the maize and potatoe, Mr. Humboldt considers it the most useful production bestowed by nature on the mountainous countries of America, situated within the tropics. 
Of sugar, Vera Cruz exports annually more than half a million of arrobas ; and Mr. Humboldt estimates the consumption of that article in Nueva Espana at more than twice as much. Cuba, as he informs us, exported in 1803, 2,576,000 arrobas of sugar, and used for her internal consumption 440,000 more. By a statement of the export of sugar from the Havannah, from 1801 to 1810 inclusive, it appears, that the average for the last ten years has been 2,850,000 arrobas, or about 644,000 cwt. a year. Cotton, indigo, coffee, and cacao, are not cultivated to any extent in New Spain ; though the Mexicans, like all other Spaniards, are great consumers of chocolate. Mr. Humboldt was at pains to ascertain the quantity of cacao exported annually from the Spanish settlements ; and, taking the average of four years, from 1799 to 1803, he found it as follows : from Venezuela and Maracaybo, 145,000 fanegas ; from Cumana, 18,000; from New Barcelona, 5000; and from Guayaquil, 600,000; total, 228,000. But in this calculation he omits the cacao of Guatemala, which is the most esteemed of all. The whole of the vanilla consumed in Europe comes from the provinces of Oaxaca and Vera Cruz in New Spain. Mr. Humboldt gives a minute account of the cultivation of this plant, which had not been formerly described. Great care and nicety are required in drying it. The demand for it is less than we should have expected. The quantity annually prepared for use, does not much exceed 900,000 pods, the value of which, at Vera Cruz, is from 30,000 to 40,000 dollars. Cochineal is another article of commerce, which till lately was the sole production of Nueva Espana. According to Mr. Humboldt's information, the province of Oaxaca furnishes annually 32,000 arrobas of cochineal, which, at 75 dollars, are worth 2,400,000 dollars. 
The whole of the annual produce of the agriculture of Nueva Espana is valued by Mr. Humboldt at 29,000,000 of dollars ; and as this calcu-  lation is founded on accurate returns of the amount of the tithes, and has been revised and corrected by a very intelligent body, the municipality of Valladolid, it may be considered as a near approximation to the truth. The value of the precious metals annually extracted from the mines of the same kingdom, may be estimated at about 22,000,000 of dollars; and consequently, the wealth which Nueva Espana derives from agriculture exceeds the wealth which it derives from the extraction of the precious metals in the proportion of 29 to 22, or nearly in that of 4 to 3. 
The obstacles to the improvement of agriculture are partly derived from nature, and partly from positive institution. Of the first class, the principal is the excessive dryness of the climate, and want of moisture in the ground. This evil has been increased since the arrival of the Spaniards, who have cut down the forests in the interior of the country, and have thereby exposed the soil to the stronger action of the rays of the sun, which in that attenuated atmosphere possess an extraordinary power of evaporation, as Mr. Humboldt ascertained by experiments. The dry season, on the tableland of Mexico, lasts from the beginning of October to the end of May, without any interruption from showers. Towards the end of that period, the verdure of the fields disappears, and the crops, particularly those of wheat, begin to suffer; and if the rains are delayed much beyond their usual time, nothing can save them but artificial irrigation, where that is practicable. Plantations of trees, and a general system of irrigation, are the remedies for this evil. 
The obstacles from positive institution are chiefly the vast accumulations of landed property in the hands of a few persons, held under all the strictness of Spanish entails, and the extensive tracts of country possessed in common, and therefore illcultivated and neglected. The church lands are inconsiderable in extent, the feesimple of them not being valued at more than 2 or 3,000,000 of dollars. But in addition to the landed estate of the clergy, ecclesiastical bodies have mortgages on land to the amount of 44,500,000 of dollars, for which the proprietors of the land pay them an annual interest. In 1804, the greedy and necessitous court of Madrid, hearing of this immense capital belonging to the church, ordained the whole ( of it to be seized upon for the benefit of the state, and directed its court of exchequer at Mexico to exact payment, not as heretofore of the interest, but of the principal itself, and to remit it by the first opportunity to the mother country, to be there paid into the sinking fund established for the ex-]  
.   A N A.  
J tinction of the vales, or paper money, with which the kingdom was theninundated. The execution of this order, which must have ruined the greater part of the landed proprietors of Nueva Espana, by withdrawing from them so large a portion of their capital, was attempted by the Mexican exchequer, but with so little success, that, in June 1806, they had not received payment of more than J, 200 ,000 dollars of the sum demanded. 
The wages of labour in Nueva Espafia are, as before observed, c 2\ reals deplataa day, on the coast, and two reals deplata, or one fourth of a dollar, on the tableland. The average price of 'maize on the tableland, where it is the principal food of the people, is estimated by Mr. Humboldt at five livres the fanega. The fanega is somewhat more than one bushel and a half ; and consequently alabourer on the tableland of Mexico, earns about one peck and two thirds of Indian corn a day. The ordinary price paid for wheat upon the farm, in Nueva Espafia, is about four or five dollars the carga or load, which weighs 150 kilograms ; but the expence of carriage raises it, in the city of Mexico, to nine or 10 dollars ; the extreme prices being eight and 15. The ordinary price of 150 kilograms of wheat at Paris, according to Mr. Humboldt, is SO francs, or five dollars and a half. Wheat is therefore nearly twice as dear in the city of Mexico as it is at Paris. But, on the other hand, it must be considered, that wheat is not so much an article of the first necessity in Nueva Espafia as it is in France. According to Mr. Humboldt, not more than 1,300,000 persons in the kingdom of Mexico use wheat habitually as an article of subsistence. There is, to be sure, a greater proportion of wheateaters in the city of Mexico than in any other part of the kingdom ; but onehalf of its population, and that the poorer part, consists of Indians and of mixed casts. 
5. Manufactures and commerce. — Spain has heen less rigorous than the other states of modern Europe in the prohibition of manufacturing industry in her colonies. The great extent and popuiousness of her foreign possessions, the remoteness of her principal settlements from the coast, the difficulty of transporting bulky commodiiies in the interior of America, the want of industry and commercial enterprise in her subjects at home, the exclusive attention of her government to the acquisition of the precious metals, and its indifference and ignorant contempt for other sources of opulence, have all contributed to produce this difference in her colonial policy. It may be thought that, as she was the only power in Europe which derived a direct revenue from her colonies, that consideration determined her to relax from the  usual strictness of colonial discipline ; for it seems but fair, that where a colony is taxed for the benefit of the mother country, its commerce and internal industry should at least be free. But no such yiews of justice or liberal policy actuated the court of Madrid in this instance. In all that related to the commerce or navigation of her foreign possessions, Spain was equally jealous with other nations ; and though her laws recognised the existence of many branches of manufacturing industry in her colonies, her government was ever ready to sacrifice those to the real or supposed interests of the mother couutry. About 60 years ago, an extensive plan for the establishment of European manufactures at Quito was proposed to the Spanish ministry, and undertaken with their consent and apparent approbation, but was defeated by secret instructions given to their agents in America ; and very lately a flourishing manufacture of Indian chintz, in Mexico, was prohibited by an order from Madrid, lest it should interfere with the cotton manufactures of the peninsula. 
The chief manufactures of Nueva Espafia are woollens, cottons, gold and silver lace, hats, leather, soap and earthenware ; but the total value of the goods which they produced, when Mr. Humboldt was in the country, did not exceed 7 or 8,000,000 of dollars annually. Some manufactures of silk have been introduced since that time ; and in general, all the manufactures, the finer sorts especially, have increased considerably in consequence of the war with England and interruption of foreign commerce. Tobacco and gunpowder are royal manufactures and monopolies ; and the former brings in to the crown a clear revenue of 4,000,000 of dollars annually. The Mexican tradesmen are remarkably skilful in works of plate and jewellery ; and, like some of the eastern nations, they have a singular turn for imitation. Very good carriages are made at Mexico, though the best coaches come from England. 
There are carriage roads from Mexico to most of the principal towns of the kingdom ; but the transport of commodities is chiefly effected, as in the mother country, on the backs of mules. The new road from Perote to Vera Cruz is compared by H umboldt to the roads of Simplon and Mont Cenis; and appears, from his description, to be equally solid, useful, and magnificent. 
In time or* war, the indigo of Guatemala, the cacao of Guayaquil, and even the copper of Chile, pass through Nueva Espafia in their way to Europe. But during peace, there is little commercial intercourse between the coasts of Mexico and Guatemala and those of S. America, on account of the] 2   A N A.  [slowness and uncertainty of the navigation to the s. From Acapulco to Lima the passage is sometimes longer than from Lima to Cadiz. Mexico and Peru, though at no great distance, are therefore incapable of maintaining any considerable commerce with each other. The chief trade of Acapulco continues still to be its commerce with Manilla. The Acapulco Manilla ship arrives once a year at Acapulco with a cargo of Indian goods, valued at 12 or 1300,000 dollars, and carries back silver in exchange, with a very small quantity of American produce, and some European goods. 
The commerce of Nueva Espafia with the mother country is carried onalmost entirely through Vera Cruz. In time of peace, Mr. Humboldt estimates the annual value of the exports, in that commerce, at 22,000,000 of dollars, and the annual value of the imports at 15,000,000. The following is his statement of the chief particulars.

This statement, however, must be considered as a mere approximation by Mr. Humboldt, founded on the average of several years of peace; and ? 

VOL. II.  therefore, more applicable to the period antecedent to 1796, when the war with England broke out, than to the preent times. Whoever wish for more exact details must look to his work, p. 699 — 708, where they will find the accounts of the commerce of Vera Cruz, in 1802 and 1803, published by the consulado of that place. It is necessary further to observe, that Mr. Humboldt does not include, in this estimate, the contraband trade on the coast of Nueva Espafia, and that he has also omitted the indigo of Guatemala, and cacao of Guayaquil, though exported at Vera Cruz, because these articles are not the produce of that kingdom. 
The beneficial effects of the system of a free trade have been experienced to a greater extent in Mexico than in any other part of Spanish America, Cuba perhaps excepted. This will appea* evident from a comparison of the export of produce from Nueva Espafia at different periods. The last Jlota under the old system sailed from Vera Cruz in 1778, and exported the produce of the four preceding years, which amounted in value to 
Dollars. 2,470,022 The exports of produce in 1787 — 90, the four first years after the new system was completely established, were valued at ' . . . 11,394,664

The export of 1802 is not, perhaps, a fair subject of comparison, as that was the first year of peace after the termination of a long war, in which the direct commerce with the mother country had been in a great measure suspended. But the same objection does not apply to 1803, the export of which was more than double that of four years under the old system, and nearly equal to the exports of two years immediately after the introduction of the free trade. 
After considering the commerce of Nueva Espafia in all its branches, contraband included, Mr. Humbodt gives the following estimate of its total amount : 
Dollars. Annual importation of foreign goods 20,000,000 exportation of produce 6,000,000

According to the above author, dollars imported into Nueva Espana and Guatemala, in 1803, amounted to 22,000,000 ; and the exports consisted of produce to the value of 9,000,000 dollars, besides 22,500,000 dollars in specie. He also states their population at 7,800,000, in 1808. 6.

The colonies, to which regular remittances are sent from Nueva Espana, are Cuba, Porto Rico, Florida, and Manilla. The government of Cuba has, besides, 2,000,000 of dollars from the revenue of the island ; and that of Manilla 1 ,700,000. The subjects of Spain in the Philippine islands are reckoned at 1,900,000. 
The appointments of the viceroy of Nueva Espana are inconsiderable, being only 60,000 dollars, or little more than 13,000/. a year. But his indirect means of amassing wealth are immense. There are viceroys, who, after a few years residence in Mexico, have retired with a fortune, which they had acquired there, of 8,000,000 of livres, or above 320,000/. When we consider the fraud, injustice, and extortion, with which such fortunes must have been accumulated, we cease to  
The receipts of Guatemala, Caracas, and Chile, are consumed within the country. Cuba, Porto Rico, and Manilla, require annual remittances from Mexico. The population of the Canary islands is reckoned at 180,000 persons, and their revenue at 240,000 dollars ; but the expence of their government is such, that they require an annual remittance from Spain. 
The military establishment of Nueva Espana was composed, in 1804, of 10,000 troops of the line, and 22,000 militia ; about onehalf of both consisting of cavalry. The light cavalry are represented as good.] The capital is Mexico, which see. 
Series of Viceroys, Captains-General of Nueva Espana. 
1. Don Fernando Cortes, Marquis del Valle, native of Medellin in Estremadura. He was the first governor and chief justice of this extensive empire, the conquest of which took place between the years 1521 and 1526 : afterwards, Don Luis Ponce de Leon, corregidor of Toledo, was nominated as residentiary ; in as much as he died a few days after his arrival, the office fell upon the Licenciate Marcos de Aguilar, who two months after experienced the same fate. In his room the residency was substituted in the treasurer Alonso de Estrada ; the same governing in company with the Marquis del Valle until 1528, when the royal audience was established. 
2. Nuno de Guzman, governor of Panuco, the first president ; he governed until 1530. 
3. Don Sebastian Ramirez de Fuenlcal, bishop of St. Domingo, second president, nominated on account of his singular reputation for virtue, prudence, and able government : in fact, he may justly be called the founder of every thing good in Nueva Espana, and deserves the eulogium of every historian. He it was that caused an aqueduct to be carried to the ward or small settlement of Tlateluco, now called Santiago ; he it was that raised bridges, opened roads, built churches, established divine worship, founded the city of the Puebla de los   A N A.  Anoelcs divided the jurisdictions of the settlements, and encouraged the breed of cattle, favoured agriculture and commerce, being at once the love and chiefly admiration of all, that he should have accomplished such great works in the short space ot three years, from 1531 to 1534, when he was destined to the bishopric of Cuenca in Nueva 
4 Don Antonio de Mendoza, Count of Tendilla, brother of the Marquis of Mondejar, and chamberlain of the Emperor Charles V. first viceroy of Nueva Espafia, who governed with much skill and reputation for 17 years; he of himself undertook the conquest of the province of Xalisco or Nueva Galicia, and succeeded in his attempts, discovered the coast of California, and the navigation of the S. sea. He was promoted to the viceroyalty of Peru in 1549, and Don Francisco de Sandoval, of the council of the Indies, remained governing as visitor of the royal audience. The latter commanded the Licentiate Vena to be whipped for having feigned himself to be visitor, and to be banished from the kingdom. 
5. Don Luis de Velasco, of the house ot the Condestables of Castille, a man of great merit : he entered Mexico in 1550, and acquired the name of father and guardian of the county, in as much as he published some laws in favour of the Indians and against slavery, founded the towns of Durango and San Sebastian in the province of Chiametla, and that of San Miguel, to restrain the Chichimecas ; and in as much as he discovered the province of Zacatecas, and pacified that of Topia, sent an armada to Florida under Don Tristan de Luna, and commanded a causeway or barrier to be built, on account of the city having once suffered an extraordinary inundation. In his time the kingdom was visited by the Licentiate Valderrama, and he died in 1564. 
6. Don Gastor de Peralta, Marquis of Falces ; he entered in 1566, and was much esteemed for his virtue and abilities ; he liberated the Marquis del Yalle, and his brother Don Luis, from the impeachments that were laid against them; on which account he was summoned to court, and proper persons were appointed to inquire into his case. His government lasted until 1568. 
7. Don Martin Enriquez de Almansa, brother to the Marquis of Alcan ices; he established the garrisons for restraining the Indians, founded the towns of San Felipe and San Luis de Potosi, appeased and chastised the Chichimecas Indians, and after having governed with credit and zeal, he was promoted to the viceroyalty of Peru in 1576. 
8. Don Lorenzo Suarez de Mendoza, Count of  
Coruna, a great warrior, of a discreet and affable disposition ; he governed three years, from 1580 to 1583, when he died ; his remains were deposited in the church of S. Francisco, and afterwards translated to Spain. 
9. Don Pedro Moya de Contreras, archbishop of Mexico, nominated visitor of the audience, and afterwards viceroy in 1584 ; he governed with singular address and zeal till the year 1585. 
10. Don Alvaro Manrique de Zuniga, Marquis of Villa Manrique, brother of the Duke of Bexar ; he entered Mexico in the above year, and had a dispute with the audience of Guadalaxara, when it was agreed that the same should be settled by arras ; but the litigation was at last adjusted. In his time Francis Drake undertook the navigation of the Philippine isles ; he governed four years, and was separated from the viceroyalty by Don Diego Romano, bishop of TIaxcala, in 1590. 
11.

==[[Espiritu-Caja|ESPIRITU-CAJA]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento ofAngaraes in Peru; annexed to the curacy of Acobamba. Espiritu-Santo, a province and captainship of the kingdom of Brazil, one of the four that compose it; bounded w. by the province of Puerto Seguro, e. by that of the Rio Janeiro, s. by the mountains and nations of the infidel Indians, running but a small distance into the country, and n. by the sea, running 50 leagues along the coast. It was inhabited by the Tupinaes and Tupinanquins Indians, who were subjected by the Aimores. This province was taken from these by Vasco Fernandez Coutino, a Portuguese, to whom it was also ceded by the king of Portugal, as a reward for the services he had performed in India. He disembarked with his followers in the bay of Espiritu Santo, and from this he gave the name to the whole province, which after many labours he succeeded in reducing. It is of a delightfully pleasant temperature, fertile in all fruits, although there is no cultivation whatever, its natives being solely given to the employment of making sugar, from which they carry on a great commerce. Luis Gonzales de la Camera Coutino, governor and cap- Itaingeneral of Brazil, descended from its conqueror, sold it to Gil de Araujo, of one of the noblest and richest families of that kingdom, who distributed amongst the inhabitants certain lands and estates, in order to induce them to employ themselves with still greater zeal in the manufacture of sugar. It afterwards became the inheritance of his son, Manuel Garcia Piraentel, who dying without legitimate succession, it passed to Cosmede Mura, his cousin : of him it was bought and added to the crown by Don Juan V. This province has different rivers, which water and fertilize it, nearly all of which enter the sea. Its population consists of three towns, besides various other settlements, the towns being Nuestra Sefiora de la Victoria, Nuestra Sefiora de la Concepcion, and the capital, which has the same name as the province. [Its present population is about 25,000 souls.] Espiritu-Santo. This is a small city, having  

ESP  a good port and castle, and standing upon the seashore. Its territory is very delightful and fertile. It has a very good parish church, bearing the dedicatory title of Nuestra Sefiora de la Misericordia, It is in lat. 20° SO' s. Long. 339° 40'. 
Espi kitu-Santo, a bay of the province and government of Las Texas in Nueva Espafia. It has a good bottom, capacious, and fit to receive many vessels ; but its entrance is filled with sandbanks, which are formed by the whirlpools occasioned by the currents along the coast. Its situation is so advantageous, that if it were fortified it would defend the whole province, and facilitate the commerce with Vera Cruz. The French, commanded by Robert de la Sala, took possession of it in 1685, giving it the name of San Luis, establishing in it a French garrison ; the news of which obliged the Count of Monclova, the then viceroy of Nueva Espafia, to send in 1687 to the governor of Coaguila to dislodge them ; but he was prevented from doing this, owing to the circumstance of the Texas Indians having already put the whole of them (the French) to death. In 1721 was built, by order of the king, the fort and garrison of Nuestra Sefiora de Loreto, afterwards called Del Espiritu-Santo, where there are 38 soldiers, with a captain and various subalterns. It is situate on an eminence commanding the country and the river San Gabriel ; but since it is more than 40 leagues within land, it cannot serve either as a defence for the bay or the coast, and is in fact only useful to restrain the incursions of the infidel Indians.

ESQU'==[[Ilache|ILACHE]]==, S. Antonio be, a settlement - and seat of the silver mines of the province and government of Chucuito in Peru ; situate in the cordilkra, on which account it is of a cold temperature. It has one of the richest mines of any in the kingdom, and which formerly yielded immense wealth, and would also at the present day, had it but sufficient hands to work it, and energy for the undertaking. It is said that of the persons workinoin this mine alone, the bishop received yearly 14*000 dollars for church dues; and in proof of this, it is only necessary to add, that an inhabitant of this'p! ace > who had become very opulent, wishing to retire from his labours, surrendered to another  his mine, called La Fragua, and which was one of the 36 which lay close together, for no less a consideration than J 040 dollars a day. Notwithstanding what we have said above, great quantities of silver are in fact extracted from these mines : indeed, as much gold is procured as is equal to 10, 12, or 20 marks each caxon ; moreover, if some of these mines were to be emptied of their water, they would without doubt render, some of them at least, from 120 to 500 marks. 
==[[Esquimaux|ESQUIMAUX]]==, a barbarous and ferocious nation of Indians of N. America, who dwell in the most e. part, on the side of the river St. Lawrence, extending e. and n. in that immense tract of country called the Land of Labrador, opposite Newfoundland, from lat. 50° to 64° n. and from long. 59° to 80° w. These Indians were discovered by the Danes at the beginning of the century before last, but they were found to be of so brutish a nature, and their country so rude and barren, that little advantage was expected from any establishment or commercial intercourse that might be adopted amongst them. The name signifies that the country was esquimantsic, which in the Abinaquian language means eaters of raw flesh ; these being the only Indians who in those parts thus took their food, the rest having a custom of cooking, or rather drying it by the sun. In their appearance, customs, and language, they seem distinct from all the other Indians of "America, and there is probably reason for believing that they are descended from the Greenlanders. They are, however, of such a brutish and ferocious nature, that there is no Euro-' pean nation that has an inclination to have any commerce with them. The little trade they have consists in hides, which they give in exchange for trinkets; but in any negociation with them it is necessary to be wary and to keep at a tolerable distance, and above all not to come near them when they are in any number, since they have an invariable practice of putting to death, when they find an opportunity, even those who come to treat with them. They, in short, abhor the Europeans, and are always inclined to do them mischief; they have been known to run down to the coast in the nighttime, and slyly to cut the cables of vessels, in hopes that they might be drifted away and wrecked. They are for the most part tall, robust, and active, of a white colour like Europeans, being always covered, even in the warmest season. Their beard is red ; and it is extraordinary that these are the only Americans who have beards : these beards they suffer to grow up to their eyes, so that their aspect is very fierce : their eyes are small, their teeth large and separated, and their hair is gene-  
ESQUIMAUX.  rail? black or of a chcsnut colour and very curly ; neither do they in their manners or habits fall short of the fierceness of this their appearance. They are savage, cruel, restless, faithless, and ever disposed to mischief, and on this account, and from the very little commerce carried on with them, few particulars of them are known. To clothe themselves, they make shirts of bladders, paunches, and fishskins, fitting them very nicely ; but these accoutrement in the men never reach farther than down to the middle, and down to the knees in the women. These have likewise a smal! jacket made of the skin of the bear, dog, or marine calf, with a hood hanging behind, used to cover their heads in bad weather, and which when up so entirely hides their faces that it is almost impossible to know them. They use likewise shoes and boots made of the same skins, adorned on the outside with other skins of a finer quality, such as those of the martes, ermine, Sec. The coats or garments of the men reach only halfway down the thigh, and those of the women to the knee ; and either of them are attached to the shape by means of a girdle, from which is hung some trinket made of the teeth of the bear or other animal, or of fishbones, as also some trifling ornaments which they get from the Europeans. Jn the summer they live in cabins open to the air, and in winter in subterraneous caves. The French, at different times, have erected some forts and settlements on their frontiers, such as those of St. Nicholas, Chichequedec, Port Nuveau,. Portobelo, &c. with the expectation of civilizing them, and of establishing a commerce with them ; also for the sake of protecting the missionaries destined to preach to and convert them ; but the fierceness and intractable nature that has been universally manifested by these savages has operated far to the doing away some of the establishments already effected. Those capable of bearing arms are computed at 30,000 ; but they are such cowards that it is no uncommon thing for 500 Christian troops from Hudson's bay to conquer 5 or 6000 Esquimaux. They are, however, as troublesome at sea as on land ; since in their canoes, of which some are capable of containing from SO to 40 men, they greatly molest the whale fisheries ; so much so that the Maloinos of the n. and the Spaniards of port Chova, find themselves under the necessity of arming some vessels for the sake of guarding their fisheries. It is customary for the Spaniards to cruize only about the coast of Newfoundland and in the straits of Belleisle, and they seldom venture farther, for fear of meeting with some barbarians still more savage than 

VOL. II.  these of whom we are speaking. Some travellers who have been in this country assert that there is here a curious race of pigmies, not exceeding three feet in height, and extremely wide and robust in proportion, the women being even still less ; and that there is no nation in the world that can suppass it in wretchedness. The Esquimaux, to whom the aforesaid race are slaves, treat them with great cruelty ; and it is thought a particular mark of grace, should the poor creatures be suffered by their barbarous masters to drink only a little fresh water. This article is however very scarce here, there being no other than such as is derived from the melted snow, since the excessive cold binds up the veins of the earth in such manner as not to permit any passage for the waters, save at a great depth. This was too fully proved hy some mariners of the n. who had recourse to the melting of some large pieces of ice which they found on the seashore, when they procured a very good and wholesome water. These Indians are, however, accustomed to drink good water from many lakes which lie in the interior of their country. The Danes, who in 1605 navigated to the furthest «. latitude of any till that time in Hudson's bay, say they discovered a race of very small men, who had square heads, were of a dark complexion, thicklipped, who ate raw flesh and fish, and whom it was impossible to make to eat bread or cooked meat, or to drink wine ; they drinking instead of this the oil of the whale. The canoes of these pigmies were from 10 to 12 feet long, and made of pieces of whalebone about the thickness of a finder, covered on both sides with skins of sea calfs, and sewed together with the sinews of animals : two other skins form the head of the canoe, an opening being left in the middle for the rower, who attaches the said skins to his waist, in such a manner that no water can possibly enter the canoe : the strength of this skiff consists in its two extremities, where the whalebone is well knit together, and sewed so tight as to be capable of resisting the effects of the strongest tempests. Each of these canoes is managed by a single person, who sits down upon his legs, the sleeves of his jacket being made extremely fast at the wrists, and his head being covered with a hood attached to the jacket, so as entirely to exclude any water. He holds with both hands an oar, which is very wide and about five or six feet long, which serves as an oar, rudder, and counterpoise : these canoes are managed by the natives in this manner with the most astonishing skill. The Esquimaux have besides these other canoes of a larger sort, resembling the European boats, the in-   WJMJWJLUfJ.'L

■  ESQ  side of which is composed of timbers, and being covered with skins, as are those of which we have spoken. These will carry 150 people, and are made for rowing or sailing. These people are at continual war with the Europeans who dwell near the gulf of St. Lawrence, and have oftentimes been taken slaves by the latter ; and thus being removed far from their native country and from their savage habits, have become in some degree civilized, forgetting those customs which put them on a level with brutes in every thing but their human shape. The Esquimaux are the only Indians who come to the coast of Newfoundland from the continent of Labrador to fish and to trade with the Europeans ; and it is almost incredible that they should be found walking calmly about on the frightful and huge pieces of ice found in these seas, some of these pieces being as large as the islands in Hudson's bay. It is nevertheless a fact that they have often been seen as we have just mentioned, carried about at the mercy of the winds and tides, striking horror into the breast of the beholder, but exciting in their breasts not the least sensations of fear ; for it should seem, that carrying their canoes with them, wheresoever they may go, they can never hurt, let what will happen to them ; and if one piece of ice is too rough or difficult, they quit it for another; but should the other lie at some distance, they take to their canoe: lastly, should their canoe break against one of these floating masses, they find an asylum in the very instrument that caused their ruin, and by which they were shipwrecked. The Mickmakers, who inhabit Acadia, have for a long time been at war with the Esquimaux ; and to attack them in their caverns, they have not scrupled to take a voyage of 30 or 40 leagues in canoes made of the bark of trees. Lastly, the Esquimaux have no resemblance whatever to the other inhabitants of Canada, or any other Indians, in language, customs, manner of living, colour of their bodies or hair ; but, on the contrary, they so much resemble the n. people of Asia, that it is as reasonable to conclude they are descended from the same, as that this country, merely because so uninhabitable, should be less ancient in its population than any other nation of America. The English, in 1773, took away and introduced to the king at London, a woman of the Esquimaux. This country was ceded to Great Britain by the peace of Utrecht in 1713 ; but they have no establishment here save that at Hudson's bay. The Indians and the French of Canada follow the chase here for the sake of skins. See New Britain, and Canaba.

==[[Essequebo|ESSEQUEBO]]==, a large district and river of the province and government of Guayana. The river rises from the great lake Parime, according to the discoveries and observations made in 1745. Its shores, which are covered with woods, shelter many barbarous tribes of Indians, who maintain themselves by fishing and the chase ; the same are Caribes or cannibals, and they all, men and women, %o entirely naked. This river is one of the laroe rivers of America. It has its heads towards the°s. but its channel diminishes in proportion as it approaches them. It is navigable a sixdays voyage from its mouth by barges, and its waters are perceived the whole way to get gradually more shallow, since it divides itself into different branches, which form several islands. It receives the waters of various other large rivers, and particularly of those called the Mazarroni and Cuyum ; which united enter it 10 leagues before that it runs, in a very large and copious stream, into the sea, through five mouths, all of which form canals capable of receiving small craft, although not safe for vessels of a large size. On two of its islands the Dutch have two plantations, with some houses for the habitation of the Negroes and Indians, the same forming part of the colony which the Dutch have established on the shores of the said river, and which may be reduced to some sugarcane   estates of about 30 leagues in extent, where sugar is manufactured. This article, with brandy, are the only commercial productions of these parts. Each housekeeper resides entirely on his own estate, and each estate is about three leagues distance the one from the other. Indeed there is no other regular population, save that which is comprised in an island which lies towards the e. It may consist of about a dozen houses besides that of the governor of the colony. The same officer is commandant of the troops, surgeon and secretary, and one who favours the interests of the commercial company. Here are two royal storehouses, and a lodging house for the Negroes of the said company, also the church. In the most elevated part of the island, close to the house of the governor, is the fort of Zeland, built upon palisades upon a bold spot, surrounded and beaten by the waters of the river and the ocean ; it is consequently almost constantly in need of being repaired by fresh stakes and piles ; besides this there is also another battery, even with the water's edge, with 12 pieces of 24 pounds each, and this communicates with the fort. [Essequebo is now in the possession of the English, having been taken in the present war. See Demebara, and Dutch America.]

It was formerly very populous and of great commerce, but in 1692 was entirely destroyed by an earthquake ; when the earth opening at various parts, and vomiting up various floods of water, which inundated the whole territory, nothing remained in the town but the gallows, which still stood in its place unmoved, looking, as it were, an emblem of justice. The natives of this province assert that this calamity came upon them from the prevalence of vice, pride, and scandalous living. Many, who fled from the impending ruin, met their death at the hands of the infidel Indians, who taking advantage of the general distress, butchered them in a shocking manner ; others fled to the city of Santa Fe and to Santiago : and from the horror that this deluge occasioned, never has there been a person anxious to engage in the rebuilding of this city, notwithstanding that in its vicinity there are some estates and farms of grazing and cultivated lands.

==[[Eustatius|EUSTATIUS|Eustaquio]]==, St. an island of the N. sea, one of the Antilles, of the Caribes ; situate in the Atlantic ocean, nine miles n. w. of that of St. Christopher's. It is the' strongest, on account of its situation, and one of the finest and best cultivated islands belonging to the Dutch, and is somewhat larger than that of Saba ; it has a mountain in the form of a truncated pyramid, nearly round ; and between it and the island of S. Christopher, is a narrow canal. Its principal production is tobacco, with which the whole of the circumference of the mountain is planted ; the same being well fortified. It is inhabited by 5000 whites and 15,000 Negroes, who labour in thesugar manufactories ; it has a tolerable port, defended by a fort mounting 16 guns ; on the top of the mountain only is found any wood, and the whole of the other parts are cultivated. As here is neither river nor fountain, every house has a cistern for preserving a necessary supply of water, and which is replenished by a vessel which is constantly employed to go backwards and forwards to St. Christopher's, for the purpose of procuring this necessary article. The inhabitants are famous for their breeds of pigs, rabbits, and all kinds of birds, not only for their own consumption, but for sale abroad. Throughout the whole island there is not more than one church, but there are many storehouses provided with all the necessary European supplies, which are sold at a very dear rate to the inhabitants of the other islands, when these fall short of their supplies from England or France. The climate is healthy, but exposed to terrible 1  thunderstorms, tempests, earthquakes, and hurricanes ; the latter occur most frequently during the months of August and September, and have often laid waste the houses and plantations, and destroyed the shipping: the birds are said to anticipate instinctively the occurrence of these dreadful phenomena, and to throw themselves upon the earth : the rain preceding them has a bitter, brackish taste. The Dutch took possession of this island in 1635, and the right of it was ceded by the states of this republic to some merchants of Flushing, who immediately established a colony of 600 families, amounting to about 16,000 souls. In 1665, it was taken by the English of Jamaica, but immediately recovered by the interposition and assistance of the French, when a garrison of these were formed in it, and it was at last yielded to its rightful owners by the treaty of Breda. It was again taken by the French in 1686, and from these by the English, under the command of Timothy Thornhill, in the same year, with the loss only of eight men, killed and wounded, notwithstanding that the fort was well garrisoned, and surrounded by a double and strong palisade and a deep ditch, over which was a pass by means of a bridge, so narrow as to admit only one person abreast. It was restored to the Dutch by the peace of Riswick, who for some time maintained it in peaceable possession ; but in 1758 and 1759, therehaving been an attempt made to carry to France in their vessels French goods, on the account of the latter, it was construed by the British nation into an infraction of treaty, and many of the vessels, having been taken by the English, were by their court of admiralty declared lawful prizes. This island, like that of Curacao, does the smuggling trade of the Spaniards. The English, under Admiral Rodney, again took it in 1781, when they pillaged it of immense wealth, but it was returned to the Dutch in the peace of 1783, [and oncemore r in 1810, came into the possession of the English. The official value of the imports and exports of St. Eustatia amounted, in 1810, to 1559/.; the exports consisted of sugar of foreign plantation, to the amount of 1133 cwt. It is in lat. 17° 31' «. and long. 63° 5' a?.]

Its temperature is fresh, and it enjoys a duplicate of the four seasons within the year ; indeed it may be rather said to have a constant spring, producing the same fruits twice in the year with such fertility and abundance, that there are regularly two harvests, the one of which is called " the wholeyear harvest," when the seed, being sown in February, is reaped in July, and the other called " the halfyear harvest," when the seed is sown in September, and the crop reaped in the January following, though this is sometimes much injured by the cold and frost. The wind, which constantly blows from the s. and which is called Ubaque, which is the name of a settlement on the height of the mountain from which quarter it proceeds, is cold and piercing, but so healthy that the natives say thatit ought to be received with an open mouth ; and that wind which blows from the n. and which is guarded against as being unhealthy, is moist and tempestuous.

==[[Florida|FLORIDA]]==, an extensive country of. N.America; bounded on the w. by Louisiana, on the n. by the United States, on the e. by the Atlantic ocean, and on the s. by the gulf of Mexico. It was discovered by Juan Ponce de Leon in 1512, on Easter Sunday, on which account this name was given to it, as well also from the great luxuriance of its trees. Its territory is very fertile, and the climate good, abounding in fruits and pulse, and particularly in oak, fir, pine, walnut, white and red lentish, yew, laurel, cedar, chesnut, palm, and cherry trees, which are used as fuel, although the fruit of some of them is very delicate. Here is also Campeche wood, but the most esteemed is sassafras, called by the natives palama or pavama ; and of this an immense quantity is exported to England, from its fine medicinal qualities, which were first discovered by the Indians, who persuade themselves that there is no disease that can resist the efficacy of this plant. They, indeed, do not less esteem the plant called apoyornatsi or patrisizanda, the leaves of which appear similar to those of a leek, although they are larger and more delicate: the stem is a sort of reed, full of pulp, knotty, of a small flower, with roots long and slender, also covered with round knots, which being cut off and exposed to the sun become hard, being black within and white without : the Spaniards give it the name of de rosarios de Santa Elena, (rosaries of St. Helen), and the French call it palenotes. This country is watered by a great many rivers, the principal of which is the Mississippi, which not only produce abundance of fish, but water and fertilize very many leagues. The woods are inhabited by wild beasts, such as dantas, lions of two kinds, leopards, wolves, tigers, buffaloes, panthers, bears, wild cats, castors, and foxes;  and of these is a species which carries a bag under their tail, in the which to put their young when they are pursued. Of birds there is noless variety : here are partridges, parrots, pelicans, bustards, pheasants, pigeons, turtledoves, thrushes, starlings storks, cranes, woodcocks, eagles, falcons, swans ocas, ducks, and others of very peculiar sotts, and some the most beautiful of any in the known world for the brilliance of their plumage. This country produces, without 'cultivation, much cotton, excellent figs of the turn plant, wl  ripe, are very delicate and wholesome.  hicb, when and are called by Europeans the cordial julap. On its coasts most excellent amber is found ; as also abundance of pearls, and these are so little esteemed by the natives, that they give them in exchange for glass beads, with which they adorn themselves. Here are two sorts of cochineal, and the plant from which indigo is made is very common, and in the very many lakes of the territory are found the purest salt: here are also mines of coal, quicksilver, and orpiment. It was once peopled by infinite nations of warlike and valorous Indians, who have given much trouble and anxiety to the European nations : some of the most civilised of the said nations or tribes clothe themselves at the present day in a kind of very white linen, made of the interior bark of a tree which is very durable, and of which threads and cords are also made. In 1536, Hernando de Soto marched into this country to conquer it with a fine army, but after various combats he died, without being able to obtain his object. After that, several Spaniards attempted the same thing at different times ; and the names of these were, Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon, Pamfilo de Narvaez, Francisco Vazquez Coronado, Don Tristan de Luna y Arellano, and the adelantado Pedro Menendez de Aviles ; all having undertaken the conquest of this country about the year 1564, but with as little success as Hernando himself. The only part of this country that was properly understood by the title of Florida, was the territory possessed by the Spaniards, the same being a peninsula or point of land, projecting from the coast in a direction from n. to s. for a distance of 100 leagues, and is 25 leagues in width opposite the island of Cuba, forming the mouth or entrance of the bay of Mexico, and the coast of the channel of Bahama. Although the Spaniards have made various settlements here, there are none at present existing, save those of Panzacola and San Agustin, which is the capital. This country is a subject almost of continual war amongst the Spaniards, the English, the French, and the natives. The former ceded it to the English in 1762, by the peace of Versailles, and   104  
FLORIDA.  these divided it into E. and W. Florida. The first comprehended the Spanish peninsula, and was bounded n. by Georgia, and w. by the river Apalachicola. The second extended from this river, and had for its limits to the s. the gulf of Mexico, to the n. the parallel of 31° lat. and to the w. the lakes Maurepas, Pontchartrain, and the river Mississippi, its extent being SO leagues ; but in the peace of J 783, it was restored to its former possessors, who hold it at the*piesent day. 
Governors who have presided in Florida. I.Juan Ponce de Leon, the first discoverer of this country, in 15)2, after having engaged with the Emperor Charles V. that he "would conquer it. This governor died in the island of Cuba from the wounds he had received in Florida in 1521.

Don Lucas Fernando Palacios, knight of f Alcantara, comendador in the order of fieldmarshal of the royal armies, in  
20 the order Calatrava which he had served with extraordinary zeal from the rank of cadet up to that of captain in the regiment of Spanish guards; he was nominated governor of Florida in 1758, and exercised these functions until 1762, when he was killed by the Indians in a sally that he made against them ; he was the last governor, for in the following year the court ceded this country to the king of England in the peace of Versailles ; and although it was recovered in the peace of Paris, in 1783, yet this government remained under the command of the commandantgeneral of Louisiana. 
[Scarcely any portion of America has been a scene of greater dispute in regard to proprietorship, since the time Alcedo wrote, than that known generally by the name of Florida. Florida, East  

FLORIDA.  
I and West, is situated between lat. 24° 49' 31" n. and between long. 79° 54' and 91° 27' w.; about 600 miles in length. Its breadth is various; the broadest part of W. Florida is about 130 miles, while the narrow peninsula of E. Florida extends, in the same direction, from s. to n. 400 miles. Among its rivers that fall into the Atlantic, St. John's and Indian rivers are the chief. Seguana, Appalachicola, Chatahatchi, Escambia, Mobile, Pascagoula and Pearl rivers, all rise in Georgia, and run s. into the gulf of Mexico. The principal bays are St. Bernard's, Ascension, Mobile, Pensacola, Dauphin, Joseph, Apalachy, Spiritu Sancto; and the chief capes are Blanco, St. Blaize, Anclotte, and cape Florida, at the extremity of the peninsula. The climate is little different from that of Georgia. There are in this country a great variety of soils ; the e. part of it, near to and about St. Augustine, is by far the most unfruitful; yet even there two crops of Indian corn are annually produced. The banks of the rivers which water the Floridas and the parts contiguous, are of a superior quality, and well adapted to the culture of rice and corn. The fine lands near the river Escambia are described under the account of that river. The interior country, which is high and pleasant, abounds with wood of almost every kind, particularly white and red oak, live oak, laurel magnolia, pine, hickory, cypress, red and white cedar. The live oaks, though not tall, contain a prodigious quantity of timber ; the trunk is generally from 12 to 20 feet in circumference, and rises 10 or 12 feet from the earth, and then branches into four or five great limbs, which grow in nearly a horizontal direction, forming a gentle curve. " I have stepped," says Bartram, " above 50 paces on a straight line, from the trunk of one of these trees to the extremity of the limbs." They are evergreen, and the wood almost incorruptible. They bear a great quantity of small acorns, which is agreeable food when roasted, and from which the Indians extract a sweet oil, which they use in cooking hominy and rice. 
The laurel magnolia is the most beautiful among the trees of the forest, and is usually 100 feet high, though some are much higher. The trunk is perfectly erect, rising in the form of a beautiful column, and supporting a head like an obtuse cone. The flowers, which are on the extremity of the branches, are large, white, and expanded like a rose, and are the largest and most complete of any yet known ; when fully expanded, they are from six to nine inches diameter, and have a most delicious fragrance. The cypress is the largest of the American trees. " 1 have seen trunks of these vol. ji„  trees," says Bartram, " that would measure 8, 10, and 12 feet in diameter, for 40 and 50 feet shaft." The trunks make excellent shingles, boats, and other timber, and when hollowed make durable and convenient canoes. The garden vegetables are in high perfection ; the orange and lemon trees grow here without cultivation to a tine size, and produce better fruit than in Spain and Portugal. The intervals between the hilly parts of this coun. try are extremely rich. The principal town in W. Florida is Pensacola ; in E. Florida, St. Augustine. 
The Spanish strength in the Floridas and Louisiana, in 1790, was as follows, according to Mr. Melford's account : Troops and levies at St. Augustine and on St. John's river, 400 ; St. Mark's, 100 ; Pensacola, 350 ; Mobile and Tombigbee, 150; at the Natchez, 200 ; Red river, 100 ; Illinois river, 300 ; in all 1600 men, called the Orleans or Louisiana regiment. 
The number of American families that have been Spanish subjects since 1783, amounts to 1720, viz. at Tensau, near Mobile bay, 90; on Tombigbee river, 130 ; at the Natchez, on the Mississippi, 1500. All the settlers in these districts are under the immediate orders of the military commandants, and subject to martial law ; with an appeal from stage to stage, up to the viceroy of Mexico. The property of the subject at his decease is to be managed by the commandant, whose fees by law are enormous. 
Florida, as we have before stated, has frequently changed masters, belonging alternately to the French and Spaniards. W.Florida, as far as Perdido river, was owned and occupied by the French ; the remainder, and all E. Florida, by the Spaniards, previous to their being ceded to the British at the peace of 1763. The Floridas were never distinguished by the terms East and West, until the 7th day of October 1763. It was then effected by a proclamation of the British king, in consequence of the " extensive and valuable acquisitions in America, secured to his crown by the definitive treaty of peace concluded at Paris, the 10th of February" preceding : that is to say, the treaty by which France and Spain ceded the territory to Great Britain. 
This proclamation establishes on the continent of America three " new" governments, viz. the government of Quebec, that of E. Florida, and that of W. Florida. The latter is designated in the following terms : 
" 3dly, The government of West Florida, bounded to the s. by the gulf of Mexico, including all islands within six leagues from the coast,] p   
"— WOWHU1W I*  iOS  [from the river Appalacbicola to lake Ponchartrain; to the w. by the said lake, the lake Mancepes, and the river Mississippi ; to the n. by a line drawn due e. from that part of the river Mississippi •which lies in lat. 31° n. to the river Appalachicola or Chatahouchee; and to the e. by the said river." Annual Register, 1763- vol. vi. p. 209. . Hence it appears, that W. Florida was a province of British institution, formed ont of a portion of Louisiana ceded to them by the French, and out of a part of what the Spaniards ceded, and what they had called Florida. And what incontestibly proves that, W. Florida was erected into a separate government, independent of French or Spanish limits, is the boundary assigned to it by the British king's proclamation, which states, " Anpalachicola or Chatahouchee river, as the e. limit;" whereas the Spaniards claim for ancient Florida an extent w. to Pensacola. 
By a treaty in 1783, Great Britain retroceded to Spain all the territory which both Spain and France had ceded to Great Britain in 1763 ; and France having, by an act of cession, in 176?, oiven to Spain the territory of Louisiana, w. of the Mississippi, including the island and town of New Orleans, Spain became possessed of Louisiana, " with the same extent it had when France posscsscd it. 
By the treaty of St. Ildephonso, of the 1st of October 1800, between France and Spain, the latter ceded to France, " the colony of the province of Louisiana, with the same extent that it then had in the hands of Spain, and that it had when France possessed it, and such as it should be after the treaties subsequently entered into between Spain and other states." 
The question respecting the right to the disputed part of W. Florida seems to resolve itself fiito this : That France never included, or thought she included, the disputed territory in that portion of land which she sold to America ; for that she never received it, or thought she received it, from Spain by treaty ; and that consequently the claims of America (built upon these two assumptions, 1st That France believed the territory to have been hers; and, 2dly, As such, parted with it to the United States) are totally unrounded. Uut, be the question of right what it may, this province, which was lately delivered up by the Spanish governor, Folch, on account of disturbances then prevailing, to the United States, will, m all probability, remain in the hands, and constitute a branch, of the latter power. 
In September 1810, a convention of independence was formed in W. Florida under General  Thomas ; and a committee, called " a committee o public safety," was ordered to draft a constitution similar to that of the United States. The convention resolved to send a minister to the United States after the adoption of a constitution. The tax on the slaves of emigrants to the commonwealth of W. Florida is abolished.

See Canada. ==[[France|FRANCES|Francois]]==, Cape, a division or district of the French, in the island of St. Domingo, one of those which compose the colony which these have established here, and one of the best favoured of any in regard to situation, extent, and fertility. Here is the royal plain, on which the Admiral Christopher Columbus encountered the Indians. This district is 20 leagues long and four wide, bounded «. by the sea, s. by a Cordillera of mountains, which in some parts extend themselves to the width of eight leagues: no part of the world is so well irrigated by rivers, and so well supplied with water, as this ; but the rivers are all small and may be forded, with the exception of that called the Grande : the most considerable after this are the Marion, Bayaha, laqueci, and Limbe. Here are mines, but the French, who are more given to agriculture as a surer way to riches, do not work them. In the Red mountain is a copper mine, and in the division of Santa Roxa, besides one of this metal, there is another of loadstone ; also in the mountains called Pela-   i mu iiVLiiwtH'  no  
FRANCES.  das, we are assured by the French thai there are others of gold and iron. The principal production, however, of this country is indigo and sugar ; for the manufactory of the last article here, there are no less than 200 mills, and these prepare annually 400 barrels of 500 lbs each, their average price being 13 livres Tournois ; so that without taking into account the liqueurs and syrups, each mill produces 30,000 livres per annum; this being multiplied by 200, makes the yearly product of this district equal to 6,000,000 of livres, arising from sugar solely, and the produce of the indigo is little less. Here is also some cacao and coffee. The whole district is intersected by beautiful straight roads, 40 feet wide, and adorned with lemon trees. The temperature is hot, and would be intolerable, were it not for the wind called Brisn, which renders the nights agreeable. In the valleys, however, between the mountains, there exists an eternal spring. The country is delightful, being always covered with flowers and fruits, and at every step is seen a rivulet of the purest water. The most common fruits are the mameyes, zapotes, zapotillos, caimitos, papayas, hicacos, pomegranates, cherries, cocos, dates, and plantains. The birds are turkeys, others of curious plumage, common fowl, and pigeons. Here are many horses and mules, and large and small cattle ; also pigs, who fatten at little cost in the sabanas, on the pieces of sugarcanes that they find there ; and all these animals, of whatsoever kind they be, multiply exceedingly. 
This district consists of the 21 following parishes :  
A.ccul, 
Limbe, 
Terre Rouge, 
Port Margot, 
Plasencia,

The capital, which is of the same name, is a town situate on the shore of a good port, and of one of the most secure and convenient in the whole island for vessels coming from France, and consequently one of the most frequented and of the greatest merchandise. It is exposed to no wind but the n. e. from which it cannot receive any molestation; at its entrance are some shoals or ridges of rocks, which render precaution necessary. The town is beautiful, situate on a plain, on the shore of a  river, which empties itself into the port ; the streets are equal, straight, and intersected by others at right angles; and being thus divided into inanzanas, or insulated lots of houses, they appear of perfect symmetry. It had its origin, in 1668, from a countryhouseor estate where a certain Calvinist pirate, named Gobin, once endeavoured to establish himself: it has a very beautiful parish church, a grand marketplace, and many gardens, which render it delightful and fertile: it is of an agreeable and benign temperature. The English took and burnt it in 1690. It is the residence of a governor and of a supreme council. It is 74 leagues from San Nicolas. 
[The jurisdiction of Cape Francois is in the n. division of the island, in what was called the French part of it, and contains 13 parishes. Its exports from Jannuary 1, 1789, to December 31, of the same year, were as follows : 3 J, 187,636 lbs. white sugar, 7,268,531 lbs. of brown sugar, 32,545,524 lbs. coffee, 269,240 lbs. cotton, 245,177 lbs. indigo, tanned hides, molasses, spirits, &c. to the value of 21,789 livres ; total value of duties on exportation, 253,590 dollars, 37 cents. Cape Francois exceeds Port au Prince in the value of its productions, the elegance of its buildings, and the advantageous situation of its port. The city, which is the governor's residence in time of war, is situated on a cape at the edge of a large plain, 20 leagues long, and on an average four broad, between the sea and the mountains. There are few lands better watered, but there is not a river that will admit a sloop above three miles: this space is cut through by straight roads, 40 feet broad, uninterruptedly lined with hedges of lime and lemon trees*, intermixed with long avenues of lofty trees, leading to "plantations which produce a greater quantity of sugar than any spot of the same size in the world. The town, which is situated in the most unhealthy place of this extensive and beautiful plain, had, some years since, several elegant public buildings, as the governor's house, the barracks, the magazine, and two hospitals, called the Houses of Providence, founded for the benevolent and humane purpose of supporting those Eurepeans who came thither without money or merchandise. The reason of its harbour being so admirably well situated for ships which come from Europe, is, amongst others, from its entrance being sprinkled over with reefs that break the force of the waves. Before its destruction iu 1793, this city contained about 8000 inhabitants, whites, people of colour, and slaves.

The navigation of this branch is much interrupted by rocks, as is also the Tennessee branch, which joins the main river 50 miles below this. A large, clear, medicinal  spring, said to be efficacious in curing many diseases, has been lately discovered on the waters of this river, about 30 miles in a direct line from its mouth. The water is so hot that a patient at first going into it can scarcely support it. Nearer the mouth of the river, a valuable leadmine has been discovered.]

It has been celebrated and rich from the abundance of the metal found in its mines ; and this used to be prepared in a laroe copper, so that no quicksilver was lost, saving what might by chance be spilt through carelessness. These mines are at present greatly fallen to decay ; the population of the town is consequently lessened, and amounts io little more than 50 or 60 families of Spaniards and Mustees, some Mulattoes, and more Indians, who occupy themselves in the labour of the mines, as also in the estates and grazing and breeding farms. It is of a cold temperature, but the air is very healthy, and it abounds in productions. On the w. part, within the distance of six and 12 leagues, are the estates of Santa Cruz, Dolores, Truxillo, and Abreoo ; in all of which are immense numbers of cattle°; and, in short, the farms are a matter of oreater consideration with the inhabitants than are the mines.

It is in New France or Canada, on the river St. Lawrence, 100 leagues above Quebec, and one from the mouth of the river running into lake Ontario. It was built by the said count, he being governor of the province, to restrain the irruptions of the Iroquees Indians, it being so situate as that from it a march might be made into the very centre of the country in 24 hours. The winter is shorter here than at Quebec, and the territory is so fertile, that when cultivated itproduces all kinds of Indian and European grain and other fruits. This fort was at first inconsiderable, and surrounded with fascines and palisades, but after-  
HAUTUL1U  
•  FRO  wards it was protected with ramparts, bastions, and other works of stone, found in abundance in the lake, on the n. shore of which the fort stands. It is a square of four bastions, being nearby a quarter of a league in circumference: its situation is extremely agreeable, since the banks of the river here form a delightful country; the same prospect continuing as far as the entrance of the lake, in which are various islands full of wood ; also, not far from hence, is a port where all kinds of vessels may lie at anchor. Some of the first colonists who established themselves here, brought with them various kinds of birds and other animals, which have multiplied all of them in a manner truly astonishing : indeed, the colony itself was in such a thriving state that it would have been of the last importance, but for the difficulty of any communication with Quebec and Montreal, owing to the rocks and cascades with which the river abounds ; nay, so much so, as to impede the navigation of the Iro-> quees Indians, who occupy either of its shores. On this account the fort was abandoned by the French, in 1689, when they destroyed the works: they afterwards, however, rebuilt the fort, and remained in it until 1759, when it was taken by the English, under the command of Colonel Bradstreet, and afterwards ceded to the Spaniards with all the province, in the peace of Paris, in 1762.

==[[Frontera|FRONTERA]]==, San Lorenzo el real de la, a city, the capital of the province and government of Santa Cruz de la Sierra [by which name it is at the present day better known] in Peru ; founded by the Captain Lorenzo Suarez de Figueroa, in 1594. It is situate in a beatiful plain of more than 20 leagues long, and surrounded on all sides by country estates, on the source or head of the river Pirao, and not far from the kingdom of La Plata. Its population consists of 6000 souls, wi hout mentioning 1500, who are servants, and are descended from the infidels taken from the woods by the people of La Cruz, when they made their sallies against the Chiriguanos, Chanaes, Tobas, Yuquis, Itonamas, Chiquitos, Baures, and Movibas ; the same sallies having been made regularly twice a year, at the instigation of the founder  of the said city, but afterwards prohibited at the repeated instances of the regulars of the company of Jesuits, in this city there are no public shops, in <*s much as necessity has instructed every person to make whatsoever may be necessary for themselves.

==[[Fuego|FUEGO]]==, Tierra del, some islands situate to the s. of the straits of Magellan, thus commonly called on account of the fire and smoke that were seen to issue from them by their first discoverers, and which were caused by some volcanoes which, although they have not yet been observed in the day, may be plainly seen in the night, at a great distance. These volcanoes throw up a great quantity of pumicestone, which is found in the sea surrounding these islands : the largest of them, and that which is with the greatest propriety called the Tierra del Fuego, extends itself along the whole coast of the straits of Magellan, nearly 400 miles from e. to w. It was formerly believed that it was united to the continent, until that Hernando de Magallanes discovered and navigated the straits, and discovered that the Tierra del Fuego was only an island ; others, who passed the straits, discovered that here were many islands divided by small channels, and that the largest next to this was that which lies farthest n. between the said island and the Magellan coast, being separated by a channel 30 leagues long, called the strait of San Sebastian. The other islands are smaller, and are not deserving of a description. Some assert that there is. a more easy and secure pass into the S. sea, obviating the necessity of passing through this strait or by cape Horn, which may be left to the s. an e. course being taken through the bay of Nassau. One of the modern navigators, who gives an account of his voyage through this strait, says, that in 1719 he coasted along the Tierra del Fuego, on the s. shores of the

121.  straits of Magellan, in a srjjaU vessel, in order to discover the pass, through which a French Tartan was said to have entered into the S. sea, but could not find it. The land of the Tierra del Fuego is, for the most part, mountainous and craggy, although it is not without some plains and fertile valleys abounding in pastures ; it also abounds in bays capable of containing many vessels, and there are not wanting forests for timber, or stones fit for ballast. The winds, and particularly the w. are so impetuous, and rise so suddenly, that there is scarcely time to furl the sails of the vessels ; and these are often driven from their anchors, and stand a great chance of being wreck* ed; and thus it is requisite that those who are sailing w. should bear as much as possible to the s. The natives of this country are white, like Europeans ; they go naked, and paint their bodies of various colours, each following their own whins, and carrying this to such a pitch, that some of them will be seen to be all red before, and white behind; they are tall, robust, and well formed, and their hair, which is very black and long, flows loose : the women also paint their bodies, covering one half with skins ; they also carry necklaces made of fish bones. Their cabins are made of wood, but they are small and wretched. Their arms are bows and arrows, and darts, on the tops of which are fixed pieces of flint or bone. Their canoes are of the barks of trees, well made, and generally from 10 to 16 feet long and two wide; each contains six or eight rowers, who manage it with an extraordinary velocity ; indeed, they have no dread of sinking it, since they all, men and women, swim like fish. Their customs and mode of living is similar to that of wild beasts ; they have not the least notions of religion, and eat animals alive, like lions and tigers. If they at any time appear affable to foreigners, it is with a view to surprise and kill them : all this, however, can only be said of those who inhabit the s. and the vicinity of the bay of Nassau; since Mr. Bauchine Guin, spoken of by Rogers in his voyage that he made to the strait in 1699, represents them affable, and incapable of doing mischief. 
The ^. coast of the Tierra del Fuego is but little known. In some maps we perceive a great number of islands without any name, from cape Horn to the strait called by the natives Jelonchete, which divides these islands from the island nearest that part. This island may be about 40 leagues from e. to w. and 10 or 12 from n. to s. ; in it are three ports, which are called San Martin, Vanelle, and La Navidad. The island contiguous to this, which is the last which belongs to the more w. part, conR  FUN  to think it altogether Seixas, Roggers.  tains only two, which are port Felix and English, and terminates in the cape Pillar, the last of the straits of Magellan on the s. part, as the cape Victory is on the n. The island called " Of the /States" forms the entrance of the straits of Maire, and between this and the e. part of the Tierra del Fuego, is a small strait, which is 10 leagues long, and from five to sis wide ; and at the distance of 12 or 15 leagues is the strait called " Of Brower," commonly used by vessels which are proceeding from the coast of Magellan to the S. sea, the same being reckoned more easy and secure to pass than that of Maire or Magellan; and tins it was that was navigated by Mr. Bauchine Guin, Avhen he returned from those seas, in 1701. The English admiral George Anson discovered, in 1741, on the zs. coast of this country, a port with such conveniences and advantages, that according to his description, it should appear a very paradise. The navigators who have visited this country, have recounted so many fables about it, that one might almost be induced imaginary. See Sarmiento Freziere, Dampieke, Anson, Le Maire, and others.

From its mouth up to Passamaquoddy bay, on its n. w. side, situated between the province of New Brunswick and the district of Maine, are a number of bays and islands on both sides, and thus far it contracts its breadth gradually : it is 12 leagues across from St. John's, in New Brunswick, to the gut of Annapolis, in Nova Scotia, where the tides are rapid, and rise 50 feet. Above this it preserves nearly an equal breadth, until its waters are formed into two arms, by a peninsula, the w. point of which is called cape Chignecto: at the head of the n. e. arm, called Chignecto channel, which, with bay Verte, forms the isthmus, the tides rise 60 feet. In the basin of Minas, which is the e. arm or branch of this bay, the tides rise 40 ieet. These tides are so rapid as to overtake animals feeding on the shore.]

==[[Galapagos|GALAPAGOS|Galipagos]]==, some islands of the S. sea; also called the Enchanted Isles. They are many, and of different sizes ; the larger of them are Mascarin, Tobacco, Devil, Health, Barnabas, and Santiago, this being the only one in which theFe is sweet water. The English captain Cowley gave them other names at his own discretion, calling the first Charles, the second Crosman, thethird Bindlos, the fourth Eures, trie sixth Norfolk, and after the same manner christening several others. All these islands are barren and desert, but the climate is mild, delightful, and healthy. They are situate almost under the equinoctial line, and some rather to the 5. of it, by a degree and some minutes, others being to the n. by two degrees. They are about 200 leagues to the w. of the coast of Puerto Viejo of Peru. They abound greatly in tortoises; and from this circumstance they take their name. The largest of them should be about 10 leagues  Wfc.  Ion"-, and six wide. Amongst them are many capacious channels, fit for the navigation of large vessels [These islands lie between lat. 1°45'm. and 1°31' s.; and between long. 89° 2' and 92° w, There are only nine of them of any considerable size the largest of which is about 65 miles in length, and 45 in width, called by the English Albemarle. A number of small isles lie w. from these, on both sides the equator; one of which, Gallego isle, lies in the first degree of n. lat. and 102° of w. lon»-. Many of these isles are well wooded, and some have a deep black mould. Vast quantities of the finest turtle are to be found among these islands, where they live the greatest part of the year ; yet they are said to go from thence over to the main to lay their eggs, which is at least 100 leagues distant.]

==[[Galicia|GALICIA]]==, Nueva, a kingdom of N.America, bounded by Nueva Espaiia in its whole extent, by a line drawn from s.s.e. to e.n.e.; from the settlement of Autlan in the S. sea, to the mouth of the river Panuco in the N. sea, and bay of Mexico ; bounded n. by the provinces of Cinaloa, Nuevo Reyno de Leon, and Nueva Vizcaya ; and s. s. w. by the Pacific, from the aforesaid settlement of Chiametla, which is at the entrance of the gulf of California ; so that it is a triangle, being more than 300 leagues long, and its extent along the coast 200. 'Phis country was dicovered and conquered by order of the audience of Mexico, by Funo Guzman, in 1531, although Don Hernando Cortes affirms, that it had been previously discovered by the Captain Gonzalo de Sandoval, when he went forth to conquer Panuco : it was then called Xalisco, from a settlement which was then its principal or head, and which still preserves its name. Its temperature is for the most part mild, but there is a great propensity to heavy rains, tempests, and earthquakes, The winds are generally very strong, and particularly to the s. which is the most general : yet, notwithstanding all this, this country is esteemed very healthy, and people not uncommonly arrive here to a very good old age. It abounds in mosquitoes and bugs as large as beans. The greater part of this country is mountainous and rugged, althoughit is not without some pleasant llanuras or plains, which are very fertile. In the sierras are found fin©     126  I CIA.  sticks of pine and oak, and in these woods dwell "very bloodthirsty and daring wolves. Here are also most abundant mines of silver and of copper, and in those which are called chalchihuites, are some green stones, to which some ascribe the virtue of curing the sciatica (hipgout). Here is much saltpetre and salt, also many tuna trees and wild cochineal, of which no use is made ; the Chichimecas and Guachichiles Indians subsisting solely upon the native fruits the whole year round. It is much in want of water, since it has no more than one river, which is however large and abundant, and which rises from the lakes of Mechoacan, and running n. w. enters the S. sea, having, at four leagues from Guadalaxara, a fall of upwards of 10 fathom. It is not fordable ; the horses pass it by swimming, and the people and effects are conveyed over by rafts. Near lcatlan is a lake 20 leagues in circumference, and in Tacualco another of 12, and on the shores of both arc abundance of pastures for cattle. In the llanos or levels of Uuena Vista, nine leagues from Guadalaxara, a fountain gushes from a rock, and presently forms itself into one abundant stream, which is not fordable, and running 20 leagues, enters the river above mentioned. In all the valleys or llanuras are found the mezquite, which is similar to the carob tree of Europe ; the maguey, and the tuna, and the Castillan fruits in great abundance, such as grapes, quinces, pomegranates, figs, peaches, pears, Melocoton peaches, and every kind of grain, seed, and garden herb : the cherries, however, bear no fruit, since they run too rapidly to wood and become rank : the olives yield sparingly, owing to the destruction made by the ants. The pigs feed and fatten on a root called castanuela, which is as common here as is the acorn in Estremadura and the other provinces. Throughout the year grow abundance of flowers, pepperplants, black and white French beans, and calabashes. The ants are perpetuallj' destroying the vegetable productions, as are also the crows : these birds are black only on their bodies, their wings being white and red, and their beaks similar to those of sparrows : one flight of them is sufficient to destroy a crop of wheat of a whole field, since they attack the corn as soon as it runs to grain, and will not be frightened away however you may shout. The animals produced here are similar to those of the other parts of America, and great has been the increase of swine, goats, sheep, cows, and horses, and not less so of the several kinds of birds. There is but little fish in the rivers, and the bees, from which however a sufficient quantity of honey is procured, are very few. Here is a territory  abounding in (una trees, of 50 leagues in length, where upwards of 10,000 bushels of cochineal might be gathered annually, were it cultivated. The Indians are docile and tickle, leaving on the slightest pretence their former settlement for another spot, being always sure of finding materials for building themselves houses ; and they sometimes will prefer retiring to the less frequented and solitary parts, again abandoning themselves to their ancient idolatry. These Indians are in stature taller and more robust than those of Mexico, and have more native genius ; but they are much inclined to idleness, and never work but by compulsion. Their dress consists of a cotton shirt and a square mantle of the same materials, made fast by a knot on each shoulder. Their shoes are merely soles attached to their feet by thongs, and their beds are mats of reeds and cotton blankets. They adorn their neck, arms, and legs, with strings of green glass beads and small shells. They have great pleasure in dancing the whole day long with a drum, which is made of an hollow piece of wood, and makes a very discordant sound : then it is that they particularly paint and deck themselves out in feathers of different colours, and their great luxury is to inebriate themselves with wine made of the maguey, this being the only one of al! the vegetable productions that they cultivate. They have no love for their country, and treat with equal indifference whatsoever they inherit. They are fond of a drink infused with maize and pepper ; and these they always carry ready mixed in a little bag, adding water according to their necessity. They make some very good woven manufactures of wool, cotton, and feathers, by looms which they carry about with them, and which they, when they wish to work, suspend to the first tree they meet. They totally neglect the cultivation of cotton, though it would thrive extraordinarily well. The principal commerce of this kingdom consists in its silver mines ; and the Indians who inhabit it, and who are of the nations of the Cazcanes, Guachichiles, and Gumares, all speaking different idioms, let themselves out to hire for loading and carrying effects. Its population consists of 38 alcaldias mayores, of which the capital is Guadalaxara; the same being the seat of the tribunal of the royal audience by which it is governed, and belonging in its whole extent to one bishopric. The alcaldias are, Guadalaxara, Xala,

==[[Gaspe|GASPE]]==, a bay and cape of N. America, to the s. of the cape of Rosiers in Canada. In this bay is a sort of island, which in reality is nothing mote than a rock of about 30 toises long, 10 high, s  *t*UHajBJHTT!  GAS  four wide ; tlie which some assert to be the extremity of an ancient wall, which is said to have been formerly united to the mountain Jolly in Newfoundland. In its centre is an opening in the form of a bow, through which a Biscayan sloop sailed, and from that period the isle was known by the name of the Horadada. Sailors know when they are near this bay by a mountain which is level at the top, and standing higher than the others surrounding it, the same being known by the name of the Round Table. The natives who inhabit the district of Gaspe, are distinguished by the names of the rivers on the shores of which they dwell ; and the principal of these are San Juan Ristegonetie, and Migamiche or Miramichi, called by the French Santa Cruz. They are tall, well formed, civil and affable to strangers, and the women are beautiful and chaste, with the exception of those inhabiting a certain part at a distance from the coast ; where, from the abuse of spirits introduced among them by the French, they have lost this estimable virtue ; the men also that affability which was peculiar to them. They are, on the contrary, constantly provoking to fight whomsoever they meet, upon the smallest pretext, and often without any motive at all, not only the Europeans but their friends, wives, and children; offering violence to every thing that comes in their way, and with difficulty restrained from laying violent hands upon themselves. One peculiarity observed by the Father Clerc, who resided several years amongst them, and particularly those called the Miramichi, is, that although they have no symptom of any religion further than the mere act of prostrating themselves before the sun when it shines, they "had, even before the arrival of Europeans in their country, a profound veneration for a cross, which they used to carry about with them, esteeming the same to be a most powerful preservative. It was on this account that the French gave them the name of the Crossbearers, and to their river the name of La Cruz or the Cross. Some affirm that these Indians are the most expert mariners of any in these regions ; that they had a good knowledge of the ebb and flow of the tides, of the compass, which they divided into five parts or rhumbs, and of various other particulars, which are related by the above Father Clerc in his work called the Gaspesia, printed at Paris in 1691.

It is about 15 miles wide, and generally about 15 or 20 feet deep, excepting at the entrance of the river, where lies a bar, which carries ei^ht or nine feet water. The lake is beautified with two or three fertile islands. The largest is about two miles broad, and commands a most delightful and extensive prospect of the waters, islands, e. and a>. shores of the lake, the capes, the bay, and mount Royal; and to the s. the view is very extensive. Here are evident marks of a large town of the aborigines, and the island appears to have been once the chosen residence of an Indian prince. On the site of this ancient town stands a very pompous Indian mount, or conical pyramid of earth, from which runs, in a straight line, a grand avenue or Indian highway, through a magnificent grove of magnolias, live oaks, palms, and orange trees, terminating at the verge of a large, green, level savanna. From fragments dug up, it appears to have been a thickly inhabited town. See St. John's River.] 
[George, Lake, lies to the s. of lake Cham-  plain, and its waters lie about 100 feet higher. The portage between the two lakes is a mile and a half; but with a small expence might be reduced to 60 yards ; and with one or two locks might be made navigable through for batteux. It is a most clear, beautiful collection of water ; 36 miles long, and from one to seven wide. It embosoms more than 200 islands, some say 365 ; very few of which are any thing more than barren rocks, covered with heath, and a few cedar, spruce, and hemlock trees and shrubs, and abundance of rattlesnakes. On each side it is skirted by prodigious mountains, from which large quantities of red cedar arc annually carried to New York for ship timber. The lake is full of fishes, and some of the best kind, as the black or Oswego bass, also large speckled trouts. It was called lake Sacrament by the French, who, in former times, were at the pains to procure this water for sacramental uses in all their churches in Canada ; hence probably it derived its name. The remains of fort George stand at the s. end of the lake, about 14 miles n. by w. of fort Edward, on Hudson river.

It is about half a league wide up to the narrows. Of late several considerable vessels have been built in this river, which are employed in coasting, and sometimes in foreign voyages. There are now owned in this river, though it does not in all exceed four leagues in length, one brig, two topsail schooners, and nine sloops : in all about 1100 tons. The navigation, however, is generally interrupted in winter, when not only the streams through the country, but the saltwater rivers^ are locked up until spring.

The entrance at the mouth of Kennebeck river is guided on the e. by Parker's island, belonging to this township. It contains about 28,000 acres of land and salt marsh, and is inhabited by more than onethird part of the people of the township. This was the spot on which the Europeans first attempted to colonize New England, in the year 1607. It is a part of what was called Sagadahock ; and the patentees of the Plymouth company began here to lay the foundation of a great state. They sent over a number of civil and military officers, and about 100 people.

==[[Georgia|GEORGIA]]==, a province and colony of the English, in N. America; it has Louisiana to the w. Tennessee to the n, Carolina to the n. e. theAtlantic ocean to the e. and Florida to the s. It is divided into the following counties, Savannah, Halifax, Augusta, and Southern. In the year 1732, certain English gentlemen, moved by a zeal for the public good, and through a compassion for the  misery of many poor people, proposed to King George II. the establishment of a colony in this country, which they considered not inferior to any of the settlements in America, either for situation or climate; since, although it was desert and full of forests, which served as shelter to some Indians and exiles, yet that it was capable of high cultivation, and of being made one of the best countries in the world ; as it would, moreover, be of considerable advantage to Carolina, and serve as a good frontier against the Spaniards, the French, and the Indians. These reasons induced the English government to nominate a company for the establishment of the colony of Georgia, which would comprehend the whole country situate between the most n. course of the river Savannah, and the s. shore of the Atalamacha ; and to this intent the patent was granted for 20 years, with authority during this time to nominate the governor and other officers. The patent had upon its seal two figures of rivers issuing from two urns, and between these the genius of the colony seated, having on her head the crown of liberty, in one hand a spear, and in the other a cornucopia, the whole being surrounded by the following motto, " Colony,Georgia, Augusta/' and on the reverse part some silk worms, with this inscription, " Non sibi sed aliis." This colony, when it left England, consisted of 116 poor persons, provided with instruments for labour, as well as arras, ammunition, and 74 pieces of cannon ; the parliament having advanced by way of encouragement 10,000/. sterling, and having nominated for governor Mr. Oglcihorp ; who giving testimony of the most active dispositions, commanded the prohibition of the importation of Negroes and of spirits, being well aware of the inconveniences produced by both these articles in the other establishments. In a short time, however, experience proved to him his error ; for spirits were always reckoned necessary here to qualify the water, which is bad and unwholesome, and the labour of the Negroes could not be dispensed with, owing to the heat of the climate : moreover, he soon discovered that a great part of the colonists were gradually deserting, offended, no doubt, at the law by which property could descend only in the male line ; and in short, disorders were getting to a great head, when the English government thought proper to revoke the concession, took charge of the province, and annulled all the rules that had been established. Even this, howrver, did not produce any great advantage ; for now the cultivation of vines, silk, and other things, began before there were sufficient hands to be employed. But immediately after followed the treaty of alii-  

GEORGIA.  ance with the Yammacrans Indians, and the numerous nation of the Creeks, whose king, by name Tomochichi, came to England with his wife and son to ratify the same. In 1735 arrived a reinforcement of 160 Scotch Highlanders, who established themselves in a territory, to which they gave the name of Darien, in memory of the establishment they had formed in the province of this nameattheend of the last century, (1700) ; and in 1737 arrived a regiment of 600 men, who had conceived a dislike to the Spanish governor of San Agustin of La Florida, who attacked this colony, when it was defended by the aforesaid Governor Oglethorp. 
The whole of the coast of Georgia is defended by a thread of islands, which runs along its whole extent; and for more than 70 miles it is full of sandbanks. But the vessels have a good anchorage, and a secure port at the entrance of the river Savannah ; and to the s. of this river is a clear and quiet basin, called Tekysound, where many ships may lay at anchor in 14 foot water, with a safe place for embarkation, since the tide on this coast rises seven feet. 
In this province are several cities, namely, the Savannah, Augusta, Ebenezer, which are situate on the shore of the river of the name of the firstmentioned ; and on the s. is that of Frederick, in the island of St. Simon, at the mouth of the river Alatamacha, with different forts for its own defence and that of the country. 
This country produces abundance of wheat, maize, oats, and barley, and the two latter are of the very best quality. The wheat is sowed in May, and gathered in June. It also yields quantities of potatoes, melons, watermelons, quinces, common English pease, which with some little care and cultivation might be produced the whole year round ; beans, sallad of all kinds and in regular succession, also fragrant herbs, wild grapes in abundance, and cherries which are similar to those of England, and which ripen in May : these are also found in some gardens and orchards, as are pears, apples, and apricots, mulberry trees which bear twice a year, as also white mulberries, the leaf of which is peculiarly good for silkworms. The olives and oranges here are very good, and most particularly in the s. part of the province, where one of the latter has been known t© grow to the height of 15 feet in seven years. The principal of the trees used for building may be reduced to the pine, which is found in great abundance, oaks of six or seven kinds, black walnuts, cedars, white and black cypress, laurels, and myrtles, with which are made torches ; and sassafras,  which infused in water makes a wholesome drink. In the woods are a quantity of birds, and particularly in the winter season, which begins in November and finishes in March : there are ducks, wild turkeys weighing from 20 to SO lbs. turtledoves, curlews, woodcocks, and partridges smaller than those of Europe. The animals are hares, rabbits of good flavour ; and when the season is very cold, in the n. parts there are great flights of pigeons, which may be easily killed. Here are also some tigers, but they are small; bears, which, when they are sucklings, have the flavour of sucking pigs ; wolves, and many species of serpents, although these are not venomous, save that of the rattlesnake, against the bite of which the Indians have a certain antidote, if the same be only immediately applied. In the rivers are found sea wolves, alligators, and an infinite variety offish, which in the summer are extremely cheap ; the same also as are the various kind of shellfish found here. Articles of food are in general reasonable, as is English beer, also rum from the other colonies. The brandy and wine commonly drank here comes from Madeira, though that which is in highest estimation is from Lisbon. Oranges and lemons are plentiful, and they will continue to be more so daily, since many have been planted. Soap here is also very cheap, but the most useful manufacture is that of silk, since the climate is very friendly to the breeding of silkworms, and the territory for the cultivation of the mulberry. There are some hopes of making wine, notwithstanding the great difficulties that have hitherto obtained, the skin of the grape not being of sufficient consistency to contain the juice, and consequently bursting as the grape gets ripe. The winters in the spring equinox kill the stocks of the vines, and those which are brought from Europe are destroyed by the insects of the country ; but it has been found by experience that the European vines being ingrafted with those of the country, the above objections are almost entirely obviated, since they thus sprout much later, and thus escape the influence of the frost ; the bark also is much stronger, and resists the insects. Some of the vines that were brought from Portugal have succeeded well enough, even in the most barren part of this province, which, in a word, only wants hands to cultivate it. The principal rivers by which it is irrigated are the Savannah, Altamaha or George, and St. Mary, the which divides it from Florida. Its principal ports are at the entrance of the two former rivers. The number of inhabitants is very uncertain, and that of the Negroes and slaves, we are assured, exceeds 14,000.  GEORGIA.

The clams, in particular, are large, their meat white, tender, and delicate. The shark and great black stingray are insatiable cannibals, and very troublesome to the fishermen. The chief lake or marsh is Ekanfanoka, by some called Ouaquaphenogaw, which is 300 miles in circumference. 
The e. part of the state, between the mountains and the ocean, and the rivers Savannah and St. Mary's, a tract of country more than 120 miles from n. to s. and from 50 to 80 e. and w. is level, without a hill or stone. At the distance of about 40 or 50 miles from the sea board, or salt marsh, the lands begin to be more or less uneven, until they gradually rise to mountains. The vast chain of the Alleghany or Appalachian mountains, which commence with the Kaats kill, near Hudson river, in the state of New York, terminate in Georgia, 60 miles s. of its n. boundary. From the foot of this mountain spreads a wide extended plain, of the richest soil, and in a latitude and climate well adapted to the cultivation of most of the productions of the s. of Europe, and of the E. Indies. In the low country, near the rice swamps, bilious complaints and fevers of various kinds are pretty universal, during the months of July, August, and September : but the fertility of the soil, and the ease with which it is improved, are a sufficient inducement to settlers, and an unfailing source of wealth. Before the sickly season approaches, the rich planters, with their families, remove to the seaislands, or some elevated, healthy situation, for the benefit of the fresh air. In the winter and spring, pleurisies, peripneumonies, and other inflammatory disorders, occasioned by violent and sudden colds, are considerably common, and frequently fatal. Consumptions, epilepsies, cancers, palsies, and apoplexies, are not so common among the inhabitants of the s. as n. climates. 
The winters in Georgia are very mild and pleasant. Snow is seldom or never seen ; nor is vegetation often prevented by severe frosts. Cattle subsist tolerably well during the winter, feeding in the woods and savannas, and are fatter in that season than in any other. In the hilly country, which begins about 50, and in some places 100 miles]    GEORGIA.  [from the sea, the air is pure and salubrious, and the water plenty and good. From June to September, the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer commonly fluctuates from 76° to 90° ; in -winter, from 40° to 60°. The most prevailing' winds are s. w. and e. ; in winter n. w. The e. Avind is warmest in winter and coolest in summer. The s. wind, in summer and fall particularly, is damp, sultry, unelastic, and of course unhealthy. In the s.e. parts of this state, which lie within a few degrees of the torrid zone, the atmosphere is kept in motion by impressions from the tradewinds. This purifies the air, so that it is found to have salutary effects on consumptive habits. 
Jn the low lands are the rice fields ; in the interior and hilly parts, wheat, Indian corn, and the other productions more common to the n. states. Rice is at present the staple commodity of the state; tobacco, wheat, and indigo are the other great articles of produce. Besides these the state yields cotton, silk, corn, potatoes, oranges, figs, olives, pomegranates, &c. The forests consist of oak, hickory, mulberry, pine, cedar, &c. The whole coast is bordered with islands ; the principal of which are Skidaway, Wassaw, Ossabaw, St. Catherine's, Sapelo, Frederica, Jekyl, Cumberland, &c. These islands are surrounded by navigable creeks, between which and the mainland is a large extent of salt marsh, fronting the whole state, not less, on an average, than four or five miles in breadth ; intersected with creeks in various directions, admitting, through the whole, an inland navigation, between the islands and the mainland, from the n. e. to the s. e. corners of the state. The e. sides of these islands are, for the most part, clean, hard, sandy beaches, exposed to the wash of the ocean. Between these islands are the entrances of the rivers from the interior country, winding through the low salt marshes, and delivering their waters into the sounds, which form capacious harbours of from three to eight miles over, and which communicate with each other by parallel salt creeks. 
The soil and its fertility are various, according to situation and different improvement. The islands in their natural state are covered with a plentiful growth of pine, oak, hickory, live oak, (an uncommonly hard and very valuable wood) and some red cedar. The soil is a mixture of sand and black mould, making what is commonly called a grey soil. A considerable part of it, particularly that whereon grow the oak, hickory, and live oak, is very rich, and yields on cultivation good crops of indigo, cotton, corn, and potatoes. The soil of the mainland, adjoining the marshes and creeks, is 

VOL. II.  nearly of the same quality with that of the islands; except tbat. which borders on those rivers and creeks which stretch far back into the couniry. On these, immediately after you leave the sal(s, begin the valuable rice swamps, which, on cultivation, afford the present chief staple of commerce. 
The soil between the rivers, after you leave the sea and the edge of the swamps, at the distance of 20 or 30 miles, changes from a grey to a red colour, on which grows plenty of oak and hickory, with a considerable intermixture of pine. In some places it is gravelly, but fertile, and so continues for a number of miles, gradually deepening the reddish colour of the earth, till it changes into what is called the Mulatto soil, consisting of a black and red earth. The Mulatto lands are generally strong, and yield large crops of wheat, tobacco, corn, &c." To this kind of land succeeds by turns a soil nearly black and very rich, on which grow large quantities of black walnut, mulberry, &c. This succession of different soils continues uniform and regular, though there are some large veins of all the different soils intermixed ; and what is more remarkable, this succession, in the order mentioned, stretches across this state nearly parallel with the seacoast, and extends through the several states nearly in the same direction, to the banks of Hudson river. 
Cotton was formerly planted here only by the poorer class of people, and that only for family use. They planted two kinds, the annual and the W. Indian ; the former is low, and planted every year ; the balls are large, and the phlox long, strong, and perfectly white. The latter is a tall perennial plant, the stalk somewhat shrubby, several of which rise up from the root for several years successively, the stems of the former year being killed by the winter frosts. The balls of the W. India cotton are not quite so large as the other,. but the phlox or wool is long, extremely fine, silky, and white. A plantation of this kind will last several years, with moderate labour and care. The culture of cotton is now much more attended to ; several indigo planters have converted their plantations into cotton fields. A new species is about to be introduced into this state, the seed of which was lately brought by Captain Josiah Roberts from Waitahoo, one of the Marquesa islands in the S. Pacific ocean, and sent to a gentleman in Georgia by a member of the historical society in Boston. This cotton is of a very fine texture, and is expected will prove a considerable acquisition to the s. states. The cotton at present raised in Georgia is distinguished by some into two]   138  

GEORGIA  
[kinds, the green and black seed ; the former is planted in the Upper country, the latter on the seaislands and adjacent lands, and was brought, about the year 1788, from the Bahamas ; and there is now a prospect, that in a few years the states of S. Carolina and Georgia may be able to raise more than 10,000,000 of pounds of cotton annually for exportation. Most of the tropical fruits would flourish in this state with proper attention. The s. w. part of this state, and the parts ofE. and W.Florida, which lie adjoining, will probably, in some future time, become the vineyard of America. The chief articles of export are rice, tobacco, indigo, sago, lumber, naval stores, leather, deerskins, snakeroot, myrtle and bees wax, corn, and live stock. The planters and farmers raise large stocks of cattle, from 1000 to 1500 head, and some more. The value in sterling money, of the exports of Georgia in the year 1755, Was 15,744/. ; in 1772, 121,6771. ; in 1791, value in dollars 491,472 ; in 1792, 458,973 ; is 1794, 501,383 ; in 1796, 676,154; and in 1798, 950,158. In 1790, the tonnage employed in this state was 28,540 ; and the number of American seamen 11,225. In return for her exports, Georgia receives W. India goods, teas, wines, clothing, and dry goods of all kinds. From the n. slates, cheese, fish, potatoes, apples, cider, and shoes. The imports and exports are principally to and from Savannah, which has a fine harbour, and is the place where the principal commercial business of the state is transacted. According to the census of 1790, the number of inhabitants amounted to 82,548, of whom 29,264 were slaves ; and by that of 1810, to 252,433 souls. The different religious sects are Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Baptists, and Methodists. They have but few regular ministers among them. The citizens of Georgia have lately revised and altered their constitution, and formed it upon a plan similar to the federal constitution of the United States. The literature of this state, which is yet in its infancy, is commencing on a plan which, if ever carried into effect, will be very advantageous to the state. A college, with ample and liberal endowments, is instituted in Louisville, a high and healthy part of the county, near the centre of the state. There is also provision made for the institution of an academy in each county of the state, to be supported from the same funds, and considered as parts and members of the same institution, under the general superintendence and direction of a president and board of trustees, selected, for their literary accomplishments, from the different parts of the state, and invested with the customary powers of corporations. This institution  is denominated the University of Georgia. The funds for the support of literary institutions are principally in lands, amounting in the whole to 50,000 acres, a great part of which is of the best quality, and at present very valuable; together with nearly 6000/. sterling in bonds, houses, and town lots in Augusta. Other public property, to the amount of 1000/. in each county, has been set apart for the purposes of building and furnishing their respective academies. The funds originally designed to support the literary orphan house, founded by the Rev. George Whitefield, are chiefly in rice plantations and Negroes. On the death of the Countess of Huntingdon, to whom Mr. Whitefield bequeathed this property, as trustee, the legislature, in the year 1792, passed a law vesting it in 13 commissioners, with powers to carry the original intention of Mr. Whitefield into execution ; and in compliment to the Countess, the seminary is styled Huntingdon college. 
This state, as Alcedo has remarked, was first settled in the year 1732, and it was the only colony settled at the expence of the crown. J 
[Georgia Western Teruitory. Underthis name is included all that part of the state of Georgia which lies w. of the head waters of those rivers which fall into the Atlantic ocean. This extensive tract of country embraces some of the finest land in the United States, is intersected with a great number of noble fivers, which may be seen by an inspection of the map, and is inhabited (except such parts wherein the Indian title has been extinguished) by three nations of Indians, viz. the Muskogulge or Creek, the Chactaws, and Chickasaws: the Cherokees also have a title to a small portion of the n. part of this territory, on the Tennessee river. These nations together can furnish between 8 and 9000 warriors. About 2000 families of white people inhabit those parts of this territory where the Indian title has been extinguished, chiefly at the Natchez, and the Xaxoo river, on the banks of the Mississippi, and a considerable number on the Tombigbee river, and scattered among the Creek Indians. This territory, for reasons which will hereafter appear, has lately become an object of much public attention and inquiry, in Europe, as well as in the United  
States ; and on this account, the  following  de-  scription of it, and statement of facts relative to the sale of certain parts of it, and the claims of the U nited States, &c. have been collected and arranged with great care from the most authentic sources that can be obtained, and given under this head for the information of the public. This territory, lying between lat. 31° and 35° n. is not subject to]  
G EO R G I A.  [the extremes of heat or cold ; the climate is temperate and delightful through the year, and except in low grounds, and in the neighbourhood of stagnant waters, is very healthful. White frosts, and sometimes thin ice, have been seen as far s. as the 31° of latitude ; but snow is very uncommon in any part of this territory. A person residing at the Natchez writes to his friend in the e. part of Georgia, that " this country affords the best spring water ; every person almost is in blooming health." Olhers who have visited it say, of that part of the territory which borders on the Mississippi, that " the Avater is good for 20 miles back from the river, and the country healthy and pleasant, and of all others that they have seen the most desirable." Mr. Hutchins, speaking of the same tract, says, " the climate is healthy and temperate, the country delightful and well watered, and the prospect is beautiful and extensive ; variegated by many inequalities and fine meadows, separated by innumerable copses, the trees of which are of different kinds, but mostly of walnut and oak. The elevated, open, and airy situation of this country, renders it less liable to fevers and agues, (the only disorders ever known in its neighbourhood), than some other parts bordering on the Mississippi, where the want of a sufficient descent to convey the waters off, occasions numbers of stagnant ponds, whose exhalations infect the air." Another traveller describes the country between the Tombigbee and the Coosa and Alabama as being healthy, Avell watered with many pleasant rivulets, affording delightful situations for settlements, and the water pure and very good. To give a just view of the rivers, and to ascertain the advantages derived from them to this territory, it is necessary to trace them from their mouths in the gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi bounds this territory on the w. : the free navigation of this noble river is now enjoyed by the inhabitants of the United States : it empties, by several mouths of different depths, from nine to 16 feet, into the gulf of Mexico, in about lat. 29° n. The bars at the mouth of this river frequently shift; after passing them into the river, there is from three to 10 fathoms of water, as far as the s. w. pass ; and thence to the Missouri, a distance of 1142 computed miles, 12, 15, 20, and 30 fathoms is the general depth. 
In ascending the Mississippi, there are extensive natural meadows, with a prospect of the gulf of Mexico on each side, the distance of 32 miles, to a place called Detouraux-Plaquemines, in W. Florida : thence 20 miles to the settlements, the banks  are low and marshy, generally overflowed and covered with thick wood, palmetto bushes, &c. apparently impenetrable by man or beast : thence to Detourdes-Anglois, at the bend of the river, the banks are well inhabited ; as also from hence to New Orleans 18 miles, which distance there is a good road for carriages. Vessels pass from the mouth of this river to New Orleans 105 mdes, in seven or eight days, commonly ; sometimes in three or four. 
From New Orleans, the capital of Louisiana, there is an easy communication with W.Florida by Bayouk creek, which is a water of lake Ponchartrain, navigable for vessels drawing four feet water, six miles up from the lake, to a landing place two miles from New Orleans. For nearly 50 miles, as you proceed up the river, both its banks are settled and highly cultivated, in part by emigrants from Germany, who furnish the market with indigo of a superior quality, cotton, rice, beans, myrtle, wax, and lumber. In 1762, some rich planters attempted the cultivation of canes and the making of sugar, and erected mills for the purpose : this sugar was of an excellent quality, and some of the crops were large ; but some winters proving so severe as to kill the canes, no dependence can be placed on the culture of that article. The settlements of the Acadians, which were begun in the year 1763, extend on both sides of the river, from Germans to the river lbberville, which is 99 miles above New Orleans, and 270 from Pensacola, by way of lakes Ponchartrain and Maurepas. 
At point Coupee, 35 miles above the lbberville, are settlements extending 20 miles on the w. side of the river, which 30 years ago had 2000 white inhabitants and 7000 slaves, who were employed in the cultivation of tobacco, indigo, Indian corn, &c. for the New Orleans market, which they furnished also with poultry, and abundance of squared timber, staves, &c. 
Mr. Hutchins, from his personal knowledge, describes the country on both sides of the Mississippi, between the latitudes 30° and 31°, bordering on Georgia, as follows : 
Although this country might produce all the valuable articles raised in other parts of the globe, situated in the same latitudes, yet the inhabitants principally cultivate indigo, rice, tobacco, Indian corn, and some wheat; and they raise large stocks of black cattle, horses, mules, hogs, sheep, and poultry. The sheep are said to make the sweetest mutton in the world. The black cattle,, when fat enough for sale, which they commonly] t 2   140  

GEORGIA.  
[tare the year round, are driven across the country to New Orleans, where there is always a good market. 
This country is principally timbered with all the different kinds of oak, but mostly with live oak, of the largest and best quality, uncommonly large cypress, black walnut, hickory, white ash, cherry, plum, poplar trees, and grape vines ; here is found also a great variety of shrubs and medicinal roots. The lands bordering the rivers and lakes are generally well wooded ; but at a small distance from them are very extensive natural meadows, or savannas, of the most luxuriant soil, composed of a black mould, about one and a half feet deep, very loose and rich, occasioned, in part, by the frequent burning of the savannas : below the black jnould is a stiff clay of different colours. It is said, this clay, after being exposed some time to the sun, becomes so hard, that it is difficult either to break or bend ; but when wet by a light shower of rain, it slackens in the same manner as lime does when exposed to moisture, and becomes loose and moulders away, after which it is found excellent for vegetation. 
After passing the 31st degree of n. lat. from W. Florida into Georgia you enter what is called the Natchez Country, bordering on the Mississippi. P'ort Rosailie, in this country, is in lat. 31° 40' ; 243 miles above New Orleans. 
The soil of this country is superior to any of the lands on the borders of the river Mississippi, for the production of many articles : its situation being higher, affords a greater variety of soil, and is in a more favourable climate for the growth of wheat, rye, barley, oats, &c. than the country lower down, and nearer to the sea. The soil also 
{produces in equal abundance Indian corn, rice, iemp, flax, indigo, cotton, potherbs, pulse of every kind, and pasturage ; and the tobacco made here is esteemed preferable to any cultivated in other parts of America. Hops grow wild ; all kinds of European fruits arrive to great perfection, and no part of the known world is more favourable for the raising of every kind of stock. The rising grounds, which are clothed with grass and othetherbs of the finest verdure, are well adapted to the culture of vines ; the mulberry trees are very numerous, and the winters sufficiently moderate for the breed of silk worms. Clay of different colours, fit for glass works and pottery, is found here in great abundance ; and also a variety of stately timber, fit for house and ship building, &c. 
" The lands," it is "said, on the^Mississippi, extending e. about 20 miles, are hilly, without  stones or sand, extremely rich, of a deep black soil, covered thick with canes, white and black oak, walnut, hickory, ash, some sugar maple, beech, and dogwood ; that there are very few streams or springs of water ; that the water is not good, and tastes as if impregnated with sulphur ; that the country is much infested with insects ; that the land is high and bluff three fourths of the distance along the river Mississippi, and a part overflowed and drowned." But it is apprehended that this description is not perfectly just, so far as it applies to the scarcity and badness of the water, as a gentleman of respectable character, who resided nine months at the Natchez, says, " The lands on the Mississippi are more level, and better watered, than is above represented ; and that the water is good, and the country healthy and re» markably pleasant." 
This country was once famous for its inhabitants, the Natchez Indians, who, from their great numbers, and the improved state of society among them, were considered as the most civilized Indians on the continent of America. Nothing now remains of this nation but their name, by which, their country continues to be called. The district of the Natchez, as well as all along the e. bank of the Mississippi to the river Ibberville, was settling very fast by emigrations from the n. states till the capture of the British troops on the Mississippi, 1779, put an entire stop to it. 
From fort Rosailie to the Petit Goufre is Slf miles. There is a firm rock on the e. side of the Mississippi for near a mile, which seems to be of the nature of limestone : the land near the river is much broken and very high, with a good soil and several plantations on it. From the Petit Goufre to Stoney river, is four miles and a half: from the mouth to what is called the Fork of this river, is computed to be 21 miles. In this distance there are several quarries of stone, and the land has a clay soil, with gravel on the surface of the ground. On the n. side of this riyer, the land in general is low and rich ; that on the s. side is much higher, but broken into hills and vales; but here the low lands are not often overflowed ; 'both sides are shaded with a variety of useful timber. At the fork, the river parts almost at right angles and the lands between and on each side of them are said to be clay and marl soil, not so uneven as the lands on this river lower down. From Stoney river to Lousa Chitto, or Big Black river is 10 miles : this river, at the mouth, is about 30 yards wide, but within, from 30 to 50 yards, and is said to be navigable for canoes 30 or 40 leagues :]  

GEORGIA.  [about a mile and a half up this river, the high lands are close on the right, and are much broken : a mile and a half further, the high lands appear again on the right, where there are several springs of ■water, but none as yet have been discovered on the left. At about eight miles further, the high lands are near the river, on the left, and appear to be the same range that comes from the Yazoo cliffs : at six miles farther, the high lands are near the river, on both sides, and continue for two or three miles, but broken and full of springs of water. This land on the left was chosen by General Putnam, Captain Enos, Mr. Lyman, and other New England adventurers, as a proper place for a town ; and by order of the governor and council of West Florida, in 1773, it was reserved for the capital. The country round is very fit for settlements. For four or five miles above this place, on both sides of the river, the land is rich, and not so much drowned, nor so uneven, as some parts lower down. About six miles and a half further, there is a rapid water, stones and gravel bottom, 160 yards in length ; and in one place a firm rock almost across the river, and as much of it bare, when the water is at a moderate height, as confines the stream to nearly 20 feet ; and the channel is about four feet deep. 
From the Lousa Chitto to the Yazoo cliffs, is 40 miles. From this cliff the high lands lie n. e. and s. s. e. bearing off from the river, full of cane and rich soil, even on the very highest ridges : justatlhes. end of the cliffs, the bank is low, where the water ofthe Mississippi, when high, flows back and runs between the bank and high land, which ranges nearly n. and s. s. e. to the Lousa Chitto, occasioning much wet ground, cypress swamp, and stagnant ponds. From the cliffs, is seven miles and a half to the river Yazoo ; the mouth of this river is upwards of 100 yards in width, and was found by Mr. Gaul to be in lat. 32° 37', and by Mr. Purcell in 32° 28' n. The water of the Mississippi, when the river is high, runs up the Yazoo several miles, and empties itself again by a number of channels, which direct their course across the country, and fall in above the Walnut hills. The Yazoo runs from the n. e. and glides through a healthy, fertile, and pleasant country, greatly resembling that about the Natchez, particularly in the luxuriaucy and diversity of its soil, variety of timber, temperature of climate, and delightful situation : it is remarkably well watered by springs and brooks ; many of the latter afford convenient seatu for mills. Further up this river the canes are less frequent, and smaller in size, and at the distance of 20 miles there are scarcely any.  
Here the country is clear of underwood, and well watered, and the soil very rich, which continues to the Chactaw and Chickasaw towns, on the c. and n. w. branches of Yazoo river: these branches unite 50 miles from the Mississippi, following the course ofthe river; the navigation to their junction, commonly called the Fork, is practicable with very large boats in the spring season, and with smaller ones a considerable way further, with the interruption of but one fall, where they are obliged to make a short portage, 20 miles up the n. w. branch, and 70 miles from the Mississippi. The country in which the Chactaw and Chickasaw towns are situated, is said to be as healthy as any part ofthe continent, the natives scarcely ever being sick : such of them as frequent the Mississippi, leave its banks as the summer approaches,, lest they might partake of the fevers that sometimes visit the low swampy lands bordering upon, that river. Wheat, it is said, yields better at the Yazoo than at the Natchez, owing probably to its more n. situation. One very considerable advantage will attend the settlers on the river Yazoo, which those at Natchez will be deprived of, without going to a great expence ; that is, the building with stone ; there being great plenty near the Yazoo, but none having yet been discovered nearer to the Natchez than the Petit Goufre, or Little Whirlpool, a distance of about 31 miles : between this place and the Balize, there is not a stone to be seen any where near the river. The quantity of good land on the Mississippi and its branches, from the bay of Mexico to the river Ohio, a distance of nearly 1000 miles, is vastly great, and the conveniences attending it are equally so : we may likewise esteem that in the neighbourhood of the Natchez, and ofthe river Yazoo, the flower of it all. 
About a mile and a half up the Yazoo river, on then, side, there is a large creek, which communicates with the Mississippi above the river St. Francis, about 100 leagues higher up, by the course ofthe river. It passes through several lakes by the way. At the distance of 12 miles from the mouth of the river Yazoo, on the .v. side, are the Yazoo hills. There is a cliff of solid rock at the landing place, on which are a variety of broken pieces of seashells, and some entire. Four miles further up, is the place called the Bali Ground, near which a church, fort St. Peter, and a French settlement, formerly stood -. they were destroyed by the Yazoo Indians in 1729. That nation is noyf entirely extinct, ffulchins. 
From about 20 miles e. of the Mississippi, to Halfway or Pearl river, the distance of about GO]    GEORGIA.  
[miles, (some say less)," is a fine level country, very fertile, and better watered than nearer the Mississippi. There is some mixture of sand with loam, the timber the same, with the addition of blackjack, and postoak. This tract is interspersed with what the French call prairies or savannas, which are extensive intervals of 1000 and 2000 acres of excellent kind, of a deep black soil, free of all timber and trees: it is this kind of land which the Indians cultivate. From the Mississippi to this river, there are no Indians. To a tract of this country, extending along the Misissippi from the 31st degree of latitude to the Yazoo river, at the s. end, SO miles wide, and narrowing as you proceed n. to the width of 15 miles, the Indian title has been extinguished. It was at first purchased by the English ; but they not having completed the payment for it, before it fell into the hands of the Spaniards, they (the Spaniards) in the year 1792 paid the balance. At Walnut hills, the Spaniards have a fort, which, according to the treaty, is to be given up (if not already done) to the United States. To the country n. of the Yazoo, the Indian title is not yet extinguished. About one half of the s. part, a distance of about 50 miles up the Yazoo, is owned by the Chactaws, the n. half by the Chickasaws." The gentleman who gives the above information, and who was in this country in the year 1792, says, " that the Yazoo is about 90 yards wide, is boatable 100 miles ; that he crossed the country by different routes, three or four times from the Mississippi to the Tombigbee ; passed over the Yazoo several times, went up and down the river on the shore ; and says that the lands to the e. of the Yazoo, (the distance of about 100 miles), are very excellent." 
Pearl river is about 40 yards wide : a branch of it, passing e. of the Natchez and nearest, in Coxe's map, bears the name of Buffaloe river. On the e. side of Pearl river, commence the Chactaw settlements, and extend thick to the Chickasaw Hay river ; thence about 40 miles e. the settlements are sparse, and extend near to the Tombigbee. This is a numerous nation, containing about 3000 hunters, a peaceable and friendly people. The country inhabited by these Indians is noted in Coxe's map to be " poor and barren land, covered generally with longleafed pine. 1 ' Other accounts represent it as much the same as that between the Mississippi and Pearl rivers, with the addition of some pine land, and better watered. The streams on which the Chactaws are settled, as laid down on Coxe's map, are, proceeding from w. to e. the Homachitta, (called by Pu reel! 2  
Hostaphatcha), Chactaw, and Souhawtee, which unite ; and the main stream retains the name of Homachitta till it empties into the gulf of Mexico. This is probably the same river that Hutchins calls Pascagoula, which see. The head branches of this river spread extensively through the n. part of this territory, chiefly w. of the Chactaw nation. White or Bluff river, on Coxe's map, appears to rise in about lat. 33° n. takes a course to the e. of the Chactaws, and empties into the Tombigbee, some distance below the head of the tide water, and is laid down as about the size of Pearl river. 
From the compact settlements of the Chactaws e. to the w. branches of the Tombigbee, the land is tolerably good ; the timber generally oak and pine, Avith some hickory, well watered and level. Of this kind is the country a distance of about 40 miles to. of the w. branches of the Tombigbee ; thence to the Tombigbee, the land is more uneven, interspersed with large savannas, and the whole generally good land, and pretty well watered ; the water, however, has a limy taste :. the natural growth much the same as on the Mississippi. The intervale, or, as they call it in this country, the Bottom Lands, are generally about a mile wide on the river, extremely rich, and thickly overgrown with canes. This general description willapply to the whole tract belonging to the " Georgia Mississippi Company." Mr. Coxe, on his map, remarks, that " on the Tombigbee and Alabama rivers there are bodies of fine rich land, but low down, towards Mobile bay, unhealthy." 
We have now arrived e. to the Mobile, the principal river in this territory. " On the bar at the entrance of the bay of Mobile, there is only about 15 or 16 feet water ; twothirds of the way through the bay, towards the town of Mobile, there is from two to three fathoms ; and the deepest water to be depended on in the upper part of the bay is only 10 or 12 feet, and in many places not so much : large vessels cannot go within seven miles of the town." Hutchins. " This bay is about 30 miles long, and from 10 to 12 wide ; the tide flows 60 or 70 miles abqve this bay, and is so far navigable for sea vessels : thence 150 or 200 miles n. is good boat navigation, smooth water, generally 100 to 150 yards wide, and eight to ten feet deep." MS. Minutes from Mr. Perry. The bay of Mobile terminates a little to the n. e. of the town, in a number of marshes and lagoons, which subject the people to fevers and agues in the hot season. The river Mobile, as you ascend it, divides into two principal branches, about 40 miles above the town, one of which, called the Tansaw,]  

GEORGI A.  
(43  
[falls into the e. part of the bay ; the other empties itself Close by the town, where it has a bar of seven feet : but there is a branch a little to the e. of this, cnlled Spanish river, where there is a channel of nine or ten feet, when the water is high ; but this joins Mobile river about two leagues above the town. Two or three leagues above the Tansaw branch, the Alabama river falls into Mobile river, after running from the n.e. a course of about 130 miles ; that is, from Alabama fort, situated at the confluence of the Coosa and Talipoosee, both very considerable rivers ; on which and their branches are the chief settlements of the Upper Creek Indians. The French fort at Alabama was evacuated 1763, and has not since been garrisoned. Above the confluence of Alabama and Mobile, the latter is called the Tombigbee river, from the fort of Tombigbee, situated on the ay. side of it, about 86 leagues above the town of Mobile. The source of this river is reckoned to be about 40 leagues higher up, in the country of the Chickasaws. The fort of Tombigbee was taken possession of by the English, but abandoned again in 1767, by order of the commandant of Pensacola. The river is navigable for sloops and schooners about 35 leagues above the town of Mobile : the banks, where low, are partly overflowed in the rainy seasons, which adds greatly to the soil, and adapts it particularly to the cultivation of rice : the sides of the river are covered in many places with large canes, so thick that they are almost impenetrable ; there is also plenty of remarkable large red and white cedar, cypress, elm, ash, hickory, and various kinds of oak. Several people have settled on this river, who find the soil to answer beyond expectation. The lands near the mouth of the Mobile river are generally low: as you proceed upwards the land grows higher, and may with propriety be divided into three stages : First, low rice lands, on or near the banks of the river, of a most excellent quality ; secondly, what are called by the people of the country, second low lands, or level flat cane lands, about four or five feet higher than the low rice lands; and, thirdly, the high upland or open country. The first, or low lands, extend about an half or three quarters of a mile from the river, and may almost every where be easily drained and turned into most excellent rice fields, and are capable of being laid underwater at almost all seasons of the year : they are a deep black mud or slime, which have in succession of time been accumulated or formed by the overflowing of the river. The second low grounds being in general formed by a regular rising of about four or five feet higher than the  low lands, appear to have been originally the edge of the river. The second class or kind of land is in general extremely rich, and covered with large timber and thick strong canes, extending in widih upon an average three quarters of a mile, and in general a perfect level. It is excellent for all kinds of grain, and well calculated for the culture of indigo, hemp, flax, or tobacco. At the extremity of these second grounds, you come to what is called the high or uplands, which is covered with pine, oak, and hickory, and other kinds of large timber. The soil is of a good quality, but much inferior to the second or low land. It answers well for raising Indian corn, potatoes, and every thing else that delights in a dry soil. Further out, in the country again, on the w. side of this river, you come to a pine barren, with extensive reed swamps and natural meadows or savannas, which afford excellent, ranges for innumerable herds of cattle. On the e. of the river Mobile, towards the river Alabama, is one entire extended rich cane country, not inferior, perhaps, to any in America. Whenever portages are made between the Mobile and Tennessee river, or their branches, which are probably but a few miles apart, the Mobile will be the first river for commerce, the Mississippi excepted, in this part of the world, as it affords the shortest and most direct communication to the sea. Hutchins. 
In addition to, and in confirmation of, the above account of Captain Hutchins, several other gentlemen of intelligence who have been in this country, say that the Tombigbee is navigable for sea vessels 60 miles into the state of Georgia ; others, that it is navigable in boats of 20 tons up to the junction of Ten and Twenty Mile creek. The Alabama and Coosa are navigable for boats of 40 tons, as high as the big shoals of Coosa river. The principal rivers which meander through this tract of country, are Seprey's and Cane Brake rivers, both which fall into the Tombigbee, and are navigable for boats as high as the 33d deg. of latitude ; and the Cawhawbon river, which falls into Alabama river below the junction of Coosa and Oakfuskee, are boatable as far n. as the rivers last mentioned. The soil on the e. side of Tombigbee is of a reddish cast, producing naturally oak, hickory, and abundance of very high grass. The country appears well calculated for the culture of wheat, corn, rye, oafs, and barley. The bottoms or intervales on the rivers are not subject to inundations, and are exceedingly rich. The country is well watered with good wholesome water. Further n. the country becomes uneven and somewhat hilly, that part particularly which divides the waters of Tombigbee fromTennessee river ; but as you descend to a lower"]   GEORGIA.  
[latitude, the country is more level ; and down about the mouth of Cane Brake river, and thence across to the Alabama, is almost one entire cane brake. 
" The ridge which divides the Tombigbee and Alabama rivers is stony, and the soil inferior to that on the rivers ; of this description also is the country lying between the Cawhawbon and Alabama rivers ; but the bottom lands on the watercourses are exceedingly rich. The country is pleasant and healthy, being generally overgrown with high grass, well calculated for farming, particularly for raising cattle. There are many extensive and rich, bottoms of cane land on the Alabama. The river which falls into the Tombigbee next above Seprey's river, has much rich land on its banks, and is boatable some distance in small boats, and spreads into many branches, through a pleasant, healthy, and wellwatered country." Coxe's MS. Letter. As you advance e. of the Alabama, in the territory we are describing, you come first to the Escambia river, and then to the Cliatta Hatcha or Pea river, which Captain Hutchins thus describes : " The river Escambia is the most considerable that falls into the bay of Pensacola. (SeeEscAMBiA River.) The Chatta Hatcha or Pea which also heads in the Georgia Western Territory, empties from the n.e. into Rose bay, which is SO miles long and from four to six broad. The bar at the entrance into the bay has only seven or eight feet water at deepest ; but after crossing the bar, has 16 or 17 feet. The mouths of the river (for almost all the s. rivers have several mouths) are so shoal, that only a small boat or canoe can pass them." Mr. Hutchins ascended this river about 75 miles, and found that its banks very much resembled those of Escambia. Further e. are the Appalachicola, Flint, and Alabaha rivers, which are described under their respective heads. 
The n. parts of this territory are watered by the great bend of the Tennessee, and its tributary streams. This noble river bends s. as far as lat. 34° 15', according to Captain Hutchins' map, and divides, into nearly equal parts, the purchase of the Tennessee company. North of the Tennessee, in this purchase, there is not an Indian inhabitant. From the s. the Tennessee, in its course through besides smaller streams, the Hiwassee, Chiccamauga, and Occochappo or Bear Creek, which are described under their respective beads. Travellers speak of the lands on the bend of the Tennessee in terms of the highest commendation. 
Of the territory described above, the state of Georgia, by act of their legislature, passed Janu-  ary 7, 1795, sold about 22,000,000 of acres to four different companies, whose names, and the limits of their respective purchases, as defined by the act, follow : 
1. " All that tract or parcel of land, including islands, beginning on Mobile bay, where the lat. 31° n. of the equator intersects the same, running thence up the said bay to the mouth of the lake Tensaw ; thence up the said lake Tensaw to the Alabama river, including Curreys and all otherislands therein; thence up the said river Alabama to the junction of the Coosa and Oakfuskee rivers ; thence up the Coosa river, above the Big shoals, to where it intersects the lat. of 34° n. of the equator ; thence a due a), course to the Mississippi river; thence down the middle of the said river to the latitude of 32° 40' ; thence a due e. course to the Dan or Tombigbee river ; thence down the middle of the said river to its junction with the Alabama river ; thence down the middle of the said river to Mobile bay ; thence down the said Mobile bay to the place of beginning, shall be sold unto James Gunn, Matthew M'Allister, and George Walker, and their associates, called the Georgia Company." 
2. " All that tract of country, including islands, within the following boundaries, viz. beginning on  the river Mississippi due e  at 31° 18' n. lat. ; thence a  river  course to the middle of Dan or Tombigbee thence up the middle of the said river to  n. lat. 32° 40'; thence a due w. course along the Georgia Company line to the river Mississippi ; thence down the middle of the same to the place of beginning, shall be sold to Nicholas Long, Thomas Glasscock, Ambrose Gordon, and Thomas Cummings, and their associates, called the Georgia Mississippi Company." 
3. " All that tract of country, including islands, within the following boundaries, viz. beginning at the Mississippi river, where the n. boundary line of the state strikes the same ; thence along the said n. boundary line, due e. to the Tennessee river ; thence along the said Tennessee river to the mouth of Bear creek ; thence up Bear creek to where the parallel of latitude 25 British' statute miles s. of the n. boundary line of the state intersects the same ; thence along the lastmentioned parallel of latitude, across Tombigbee or Twenty Mile creek, due w. to the Mississippi river ; thence up the middle of the said river to the beginning, shall be sold to John B. Scott, John C. Nightingale, and Wade Hampton, called the Upper Mississippi Company." 
4. " All that tract of land, including islands, within the following boundaries, viz. beginning at the mouth of Bear creek, on the s. side of Ten-]  fncssce river ; thence up the said creek to the most s. source thereof; thence due s. to lat. 34° 10' n. ; thence due e. 120 miles ; thence a due n. course, to the Great Tennessee river; thence up the middle of the said river to the n. boundary line of the state ; thence a due w. course along the said line to where it intersects the Great Tennessee river, below the Muscle shoals ; thence up the said river to the place of beginning, shall be sold to Zachariah Cox, Mathias Maher, and their associates, called the Tennessee Company." 
The same law enacts also, " That all lands lying w. and s. of the e. boundary of the several companies purchases, and not included therein, estimated at onefourth of the whole lands lying w. and s. of the e. boundary of the said purchases, and supposed to contain 7,250,000 acres, shall be, and the same is hereby, declared to be reserved and set apart to, and for the use and benefit of this state, to be granted out, or otherwise disposed of, as future legislatures may direct." Act of Georgia Legislature, of Jan. 7th, 1795. 
The purchasemoney, amounting to 500,000 dollars, was duly paid by the respective companies into the state treasury of Georgia, agreeably to the terms of the act. This land was soon after sold by the original companies to various gentlemen, principally in the middle and e. states. The sale of this territory excited a warm and violent opposition in Georgia. The act authorising this sale was, by certain leading men in the state, declared to be " an usurped act, repugnant to the principles of the federal constitution, and of the constitution of Georgia ; opposed to the good of the state, and obtained by fraud, atrocious speculation, corruption, and collusion." In consequence of these representations, a determination was formed by a powerful party, to set aside and annul at the succeeding session of the legislature this offensive, " usurped act." Efforts were accordingly made, and with success, to obtain a legislature suited to the accomplishment of their designs. Accordingly, on the 13th of February 1796, an act was passed declaring the abovementioned " usurped act" null and void : and all the grants, rights, and claims arising therefrom, of no validity or effect ; and that the said territory Was the sole property of the state." To complete the utter annihilation of this odious act, as far as possible, the legislature ordered, that, in their presence, and that of the public officers of the state, the several records, documents, and deeds, in the several public offices, should be " expunged from the faces and indexes of the books of record of the state ; and the enrolled law, or usurped act, pubVOL. II.    licly burnt." All this was accomplished three days after the passing of the act. These unprecedented proceedings were attended and followed with most disagreeable and tumultuary effects. The original purchasers of these lands, the then holders, and all those who had been intermediately concerned, who had by this time become a numerous and respectable body, scattered through the United States, were, for the moment, thrown into an unpleasant dilemma, and for a time this business was the general topic of conversation. The title to the lands purchased by the abovenamed companies, has been still further embarrassed by a claim brought forward in behalf of the linked States.]

America ; bounded e. towards the s. by the extensive llanos or plains of San Juan, w. by some mountains and woods which are very thick and of great extent, and n. by some extremely craggy mountains extending as far the seacoast. It is 80 leagues long n. s. and somewhat less wide e. w. : it was called in the time of the Indians Cundinamarca ; was discovered and conquered by Gonzalo Ximenez de Quesada, who named it in memory of the kingdom so called in Andalucia, of which he was a native. It contains the provinces of Bogota, Neiba,

These are divided, as to the chief government, into 51 corregimientos, in which are 301 settlements, and in these 18,359 Indians ; also into five military governments, which are Panama, Portobelo, Cartagena, Santa Marta, and Maracaibo, although the two former are of the kingdom of Tierra Firme ; and into seven civil governments, viz. Antioquia, Choco, Mariquita, Giron, Neiba, Llanos de San Juan, and Veragua: formerly under the same jurisdiction was the commandancygeneral of La Guayana and the government of Caracas. This kingdom enjoys diil'erent climates according to its extent; for in it  

GRA  are found parts where the cold is very great, and in which breed stags, bears, rabbits, dantas, and mountain cats ; llanos, of which the soil is mild and temperate, and fertile in all kinds of seeds and fruits, and other plains where cattle breed in such abundance as at times to be troublesome from their numbers. The woods are many and delightful, from the variety of the trees and birds; amongst which are some justly celebrated for their song, of which is the loche of a black plumage, the stole of a deep black with golden spots, and the azulejo of a skyblue, and the babaguy of a yellow and black, the which surpass in the sweetness of their note the goldfinch, canary, and nightingale. Those parts that are subject to the cold climate are Santa Fe, Tunja, Pamplona, and Merida; and those of the warm climate are Cartagena, Santa Marta, Antioquia, Muzo, Mariquita, Neiba, and S. Juan de los Llanos, where the temperature is the whole year round nearly like the summer in Spain. The cold in the other parts is general throughout the year, though not very severe ; the change of the four seasons not being known there, and it being called summer then only when it does, not rain, notwithstanding that it should freeze, and the cold be considerable. No calculation can be formed respecting the setting in of the rains, or is it possible to have any security against them ; they, for the most part, begin in October and February : it may be said of them generally, that they by no means observe, in regard to their periods, the same nature peculiar to other parts. The kingdom of Nueva Granada being so immediately under the line, is fanned by very salutary breezes, the same rendering it one of the most healthy countries. It is extremely rich in mines, and those of gold, which are found in many parts, exceed all the other discoveries in America; and in the cities of Antioquia, Zaragoza, Caceres, Remedios, Anserma, and Rio del Oro, no other coin than gold is current: the same is the case in the city of Guamoco, as also in the settlements about the celebrated veins of Pamplona and San Juan de los Llanos. Here is also found silver so fine that it is esteemed the best in all the Indies ; and the mines of Marquetones, denominated High and Low, {Alia. y Baxa), and which are in the province of Pamplona, are so rich, that were it not for the scarcity of hands to work them, they would even surpass the celebrated mountain of Potosi, since they in general render two marks of silver foreachquintal, and sometimes eight. Copper and lead are metals that bear no value here; and although each of them abound in various parts, the mines are not worked. The emeralds hers x 2    156  

GRANADA.  much exceed those of the e. in value, and through them the province of Muzo, where the best are obtained, has been rendered celebrated. Indeed, those of the mines of Somondoco in the province of Tenza, although very fine, are by no means equal to those of the first mentioned province ; and the greatest peculiarity of them is, that in the same mines from -whence they are extracted, are found pant auras of various colours, with grains of gold inside of them. In the mines of Antioquia and Guamoco, are found diamonds amongst the points of gold, although the same are small; also crossstones, (piedras de cruz), of singular virtues against fevers and colds ; also fine granates, the abundance of which renders them less estimable. The river Hacha has always deserved particular memory for its celebrated pearls, and Timana for its amethysts and pantauras, in the same manner that Pamplona, Sussa, and Anserma, have been celebrated for their precious stones, called there turquesas or Turkey stones, giresoles, gallinazas, and mdpolas. The mountains of this kingdom are the repository of wild beasts and fine animals ; . and, in the hot parts more particularly, there are fjund tigers of uncommon fierceness, lions, though of a small size, chunzos, eritos, -zaynos, faras, arditlas resembling voracious ferrets, and by no means of a milder nature, weasels, coy as, scorpions, vipers, snakes of different species and sizes, amongst the which the most dreaded is the taya, both for its courage and agility i this is of a brown colour with spots rather dark : it has, moreover, this great distinction from all other snakes, in as much as they, when pursued by man, invariably fly, whereas this will attack any body, even without provocation. In the waters of some of the rivers, such as the Magdalena and the Fusagasuga, are alligators measuring from 14 to 16 feet in length, similar to crocodiles, the which are found as well in the above as in other rivers ; also in the marshes and lakes are found marine wolves, otters, thornbacks, and snakes of such a size that we are assured by the Sr. Piedrahita, that in the province of San Juan de los Llanos, they are capable of swallowing a man. 
This province is watered by very many rivers, and some of them are very large ; of such, in the province of Cartagena, is the Grande of La Magdalena, in the province of Bogota, the Eunzha, which has changed its name, being called by the same title as the province itself; in the province of Tiuija the Sogamosa, in that of Tensa the Garagoa : all these three rise from the paramos and Cordillera of Gachaneque, opposite Tumerque ; are distant a little more than one league from each  other, and all take their course through the loftiest part of the kingdom. In the province of Velez the most notable is the Sarabita, which is at the present day called Suarez ; in Pamplona, the Rio del Oro and the Sulia, which is a very abundant stream, emptying itself into the lake of Maracaibo ; in Los Marquetones, is the Guali and the Guarino ; in the province of Neiba, the aforesaid river of La Magdalena, those of Cuello la Sabandija, Cabrera, and others ; in Los Sutagaos, the Fusagasuga ; in Los Panches, the Rio Negro and the Bogota ; and in the province of Ubaquc another Rio Negro, distinct from the former ; not to mention an infinite variety of others of less note : in all of which are found abundance of fish of an excellent quality, and amongst the most esteemed is the bagre, which in some parts is called chimle, and most commonly capitan: also in the river Bogota has been observed by some curious persons a fish of a very peculiar nature, the bones of the head of which, upon being separated, represent each of them the different insignias of the passion of our Saviour, so that you may here perceive a perfect lance, a cross, the nails, &c. 
This country abounds no less in excellent woods, the which deserve particular note ; such are the cedar, Avalnut, biomatas, ebony, and pomegranate; the celebrated wood of muzo, red and black, the wood of Guayana, of a brown and black colour, the tamarisk in great request for making glasses, the Brazil wood for dyes, the sassafras for medicines, the cochineal which grows in Sogamoso, the cacao in Merida, Maracaibo, Caracas, and Santa Marta, the red balsam, that of Tolu, of Maria, the Benjamin -tree, incense, storax, and baynilla. With regard to flowers and fruits, there is scarce any one but what is found in this kingdom ; for as it enjoys an eternal spring, the trees are always covered with green and blossoms, since even when the fruit is ripe, fresh buds are still sprouting : amongst these trees the most worthy of note is a species of palm, found in the provinces of Muzos and of Los Marquetones, so lofty that it would appear impossible to gather the fruit from the top ; and, indeed, it consequently only affords a food for the birds, who let the fruit fall upon the ground, which is naturally stony and rough ; and when broken, is found to contain a kernel much esteemed for its delicate flavour. In short, if we were to take upon us to relate minutely all that could be said in favour of this country, it would oblige us to exceed the limits of our article, and to write a long history : those, therefore, Avho wish to be further informed, we refer to what has been written by the most illustrious Don Lucas de  

==[[Granada|GRANADA]]==,  Piedraliita, bishop of Santa Marta and Panama, by the Fr. Antonio Zamora, Don Francisco Antonio Moreno, fiscal of the audience of Santa Fe, by Don Basilio de Oviedo, by the chronicler Antonio de Herrera, and various other historians. When the Spaniards entered this kingdom, it was governed by two princes, elected in" Bogota and Tunja, the former of whom was called Zipa : these princes ruled over other various chieftains, and the whole country was so covered with Indians that the conquerors denominated them moscas (flies), to signify their immense numbers. Down to the present day, however, great changes have taken place. Its population is far from equal to its resources, and it cannot, therefore, with propriety be reckoned one of the most opulent kingdoms in the world, although we take into accounf its native riches, fertility, climate, productions, and other qualifications. It is governed by a viceroy, established in 1718, whose government was afterwards abolished, and again established in 1739, having been theretofore, from the time of its conquest, governed by a president. 
[The annual produce of the mines of Nueva Granada, as calculated from the amount of the royal duties, and therefore considerably under the truth, amounts to 18,000 Spanish marks of pure gold, and very few of silver; the value in dollars is 2,624,760, the gold being estimated at U5Us dollars, and the silver at 9^ dollars the Spanish mark. Besides this we must add for contraband 1 735,240 dollars, and the total produce will then be 4,360,000. 
According to Humboldt, the dollars imported into Nueva Granada, in 1803, amounted to 5,700,000, and the exports consisted of produce to the value of 2,000,000 dollars, besides 3,000,000 dollars in specie. He also states the population, in 1808, at 1,800,000.]

Granada, a city of the province and government of Nicaragua in the kingdom of Guatemala, founded on the shore of the lake, by Francisco Hernandez, in 1523. It has two convents of the monks of St. Francis and of La Merced. This city is 16 leagues from that of Leon, 24 from Realcjo, and 90 from Guatemala. The pirate Edward David sacked it in 16S7. 
Granada, an island of the N. sea, one of the Less Antilles or Caribes. It is 17 miles long from n. to s. in form of an halfmoon, and 10 wide at its broadest part. The Father du Tertre makes it twice as large as the island St. Christopher ; and the Pather Labat affirms, that through the observation of those who have gone over it, it does not exceed 22 leagues in circumference. The Caribes Indians, its pristine inhabitants, had settled here in larger tribes than in anyother of the islands, invited by the advantages it offered both for fishing and the chase, and its natural fertility. The French, under the command of M. de Poincj 7,attempted to establish themselves here in 1638, and thesamehasbeenthewish ofvariousothers,who have failed in their enterprise, owing to the then formidable power of the Caribes, and the circumstance of St. Christopher's island being too far distant to lend any assistance. The honour of this establishment was, however, reserved for Mr. Parquet, governor of Martinique, who undertook the expedition at his own cost, carrying with him 200 picked men, provided with presents designed for the savages, but not without arms, in case opposition should be offered to his designs. Accordingly, having arrived here after four days sail, he was received with great pomp and testimonies of gladness by the commander of the Indians. Mr. Parquet in less than a week's time had built a  

GRANADA.  fort, and by dint of civilities to the Indians, and making them presents of linen, knives, brandy, and other articles, had obtained from them the grant of the proprietorship of the whole island, with the exception of their own dwellings. 
Scarcely had the French gathered their first crop of tobacco, the quality of which was so superior, as that one pound of it was worth more tlian three pounds of any gathered in the other islands, than the Caribes began to repent of their bargain ; and accordingly, without any formal declaration of war, committed the most outrageous hostilities, killing the French wherever they could find them, whether engaged in the woods, in the chase, or employed in catching turtle on the coasts. The French, however, being reinforced by a detachment from Martinique, attacked the savages ; and these, although they defended themselves with great valour, found themselves under the necessity of retiring to a mountain, from the top of which they rolled down stones and trunks of trees upon their enemies ; and being afterwards joined by some other Caribes from St. Vincent and Dominica, made a sally against the French : but here again they had to repent their conduct; for the greater part of them were put to the sword, and 40 that escaped took a boat and committed themselves to the sea. 
The conquerors burnt their cabins, destroyed their gardens, broke up their plantations of 7/uca, and did all the mischief they could : notwithstanding this, different bodies of Indians contrived still to be very troublesome to their invaders, and succeeded in putting many to death. Yet still' the French were victorious, and one morning before daybreak, taking the Indians by surprise, they put all they could meet to the sword, without respect to sex or age, burning and destroying all the possessions that they had left, and even their canoes, thereby cutting off all possibility of escape. Afrer all this, however, the Indians rose again three several times. 
Some French planters mutinied against the proprietor, Mr. Parguet ; and he having consumed the whole of his fortune, sold the island, in 1657, to the Count of Cerillac, of Paris, for 90,000 francs. This person sent to the government here a man of a tyrannical and brutish disposition, who was first deserted by the greater part of the inhabitants, and afterwards put to death. In 1664, the island was again sold to the "W. India Company of France for 100,000 francs; although at that time it had no more than 150 colonists remaining of those who were in it at the time that the purchase was made by the count. In 1674, the comVOL. II.  pany found it requisite io resign it to the king ; and this change of masters tended only to its ruin; for, till within very late years, this island has pror duced no emolument whatever, notwithstanding that the Fathers Tertre and Labat speak so highly of it, affirming that it enjoys such a salutary air and so fertile a territory. The trees, as well those bearing fruit as those used for building, are more lofty, straight, and thick than those found in the other islands, save the coco tree, Avhich here is not so large : the tree in greatest esteem is that called latino t which is very lofty, and has, instead of branches, large leaves similar to fans, and which serve for covering the houses. 
This island abounds greatly in saline earths and in armadillos, the flesh of which is as good as that of the sheep, and affords the principal aliment of the natives, who are also particularly fond of turtle and lobsters. On the coast are some beautiful valleys, watered by various rivers, the which, for the most part, have their origin from a lake situate in the lofty part of a mountain in the centre of the island ; and one of these rivers enters the sea in the e. part, where the coast is shoal, but of a sound bottom, the current, however, rapid. In various parts of the island are good bays and ports, where ships may ride safe at anchor or unlade; and some of these are fortified. The whole of the e, coast is clear and safe, and has the advantage of never being troubled with hurricanes ; but what is most in its favour is, that its territory is capable of producing all the fruits peculiar to its climate. The principal of its productions are cattle in abundance, birds, grasshoppers, sugar, ginger, indigo, tobacco, and millet. That part near the coast is chiefly inhabited ; and here the country is mountainous; the whole of the other part of the island being a beautiful country, over which one may travel with equal convenience, either in a carriage or on horseback. 
The port, which is called Louis, is in the middle of a beautiful bay on the sy.side of the island, having a sandy bottom, and capable of receiving 1000 vessels, from 3 to 400 tons each, in perfect security against all weathers. Near to this port is another large cove divided from the port by a sandbank, which, if the said bank could be removed, would contain more than 100 vessels. By reason of this bank, the large vessels have to pass at 80 yards distance from one of the two small mountains, which are at the entrance of the port, and half a mile from the other, there being on one of them a fort, which was built by a French engineer, having a halfmoon and other regular stone fortifications ; here is also another tolerable fort,   !TT-=    ■Ii|  GRANADA.  consisting of a wooden square, and being 25 feet in front, surrounded by a strong estacade of trees, and having at its two angles, that look to the sea, two small wooden pavilions, in one of wliich lives the commander. The first possessor, Mr. Parquet, lived in a very large forest which girts the mountain, near the port; and on the skirt of which are placed the storehouses for provisions and wood. The church, which is at a small distance from the fort, is poor, and built of canes fastened together. Originally all the barracas or cabins were of two stories, and thither the people who lived in the country used to retire in the nighttime, by way of protection against the Caribes. 
The natives of the island of Dominica have an establishment in this island of more than a mile long, four leagues to the n. of the fort, close upon a noble river, abounding in eels, trout, and other fish : in the thickets are quantities of partridges, pigeons, thrushes, parrots, &c. 'The people here are subject to obstinate fevers, which regularly terminate in dropsy. A third part of the island is uncultivated ; and although the greater part of it consists in mountains almost incapable of receiving cultivation, yet industry and perseverance have already given, even to these parts, a very pleasing appearance. 
The whole of this island is divided into six parishes, which are, De Saltadores, Del Pobre Grande, De la Playa de las Goyabas, Del Gran Marques, De la Tierra Baxa, and De Maigrin. [These six parishes are now known by different names, as follows : St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John ; and its chief dependency, Cariacou island, forming a seventh. Besides St. George's, the capital, the other towns are inconsiderable villages, generally situated at the bays or shipping places. Besides Grenville or La Bay, is a port of entry, with distinct revenue officers, independent of St. George's.] Its produce, in 1770, amounted to 506,000/. ster-  ling. It was neutral until 1763, and the English became its possessors by the peace of Paris, in the year 1771, it experienced a considerable loss by a fire which destroyed the capital, called St. George's ; and this was scarcely rebuilt when another fire happened in 1775, destroying it altoae- ther; the loss being estimated at 500,000/. sterling. 
[Granada was discovered by Columbus in Ins third voyage, in 1498. It remained in obscurity, under its native possessors, as we have seen, till 1638, when the French first established themselves in it. Since its cession to Great Britain in 1763, it was taken by the French in the American war ; and at the peace of 1783, it was restored to Great Britain. 
The hurricanes in 1780, the insurrection in 1795, and perhaps other circumstances, have operated as an impediment to the progressive cultivation and produce, which a view of this rich country seems to promise. It annually sends home with its Grenadines 2,000,000 lbs. of cotton, besides coffee, &c. 
In the report of the privy council on the slave trade, in 1788, the British property vested here is estimated at 89,000 taxed acres of patented estates and the Negroes are computed at 20,000, at 50/! each negro.

The lick is nearly level, and lies between the head of the cane swamp and the ascent of the ridge.

Mr. Bartram could not discover any thing saline in its taste, but an insipid sweetness: horned cattle horses, and deer, are immoderately fond of it, insomuch that their excrement, which almost totally covers the earth to some distance round this place appears to be perfect clay, which, when dried by the sun and air, is almost as hard as brick.] 
[Great Springs is an amazing fountain of transparent, cool water, situated near the road, about midway between Augusta and Savannah.

The ebullition is copious, active, and continual, over the ragged apertures in the rocks, which lie seven or eight feet below, swelling the surface considerably, immediately above it : the waters descend swiftly from the fountain, forming at once a large brook, six or eight yards ovei ?,and five or six feet deep. There are multitudes of fish in the fountain, of various tribes, chiefly the several species of bream, trout, catfish, and gar, which are beheld continually ascending and descending through the rocky apertures. Bartram, from whose travels the above is taken, observes that he crossed no stream or brook of water within 12 or 15 miles of this fountain, but had in view vast savannahs, swamps, and cane meadows, which he thinks are the reservoirs which feed this grotto.] Great.

[cessible cliffs, and meets the mariner's eye leagues at sea. The Greenlanders, reckoned amount to about 7000, live to the s. of the 62° of «. lat. or, as the inhabitants are wont to say, in the s. ; but no Europeans live there, so that those parts are but little known. The European colonies have fixed themselves to the /?. of lat. 62°. 
The astonishing mountains of ice in this country may well be recorded among its greatest curiosities. Nothing can exhibit a more dreadful, and at the same time a more dazzling appearance, than those prodigious masses of ice that surround the whole coast in various forms, reflecting a multitude of colours from the sunbeams, and calling to mind the enchanting scenes of romance. Such prospects they yield in calm weather ; but when the wind begins to blow, and the waves to rise in vast billows, the violent shocks of those pieces of ice, dashing one against another, fill the mind with horror. 
As this country is covered, in most places, with everlasting ice and snow, it is easy to imagine that it must be extremely cold. Among the vegetables of this cold country, are sorrel of various sorts, angelica, wild tansy, scurvygrass in great quantities, wild rosemary, dandalions in plenty, and various sorts of grass ; wortleberries and cranberries grow here. Europeans have sown barley and oats, which grow as high and as thrifty as in warmer climates, but seldom advance so far as to ear, and never, even in the warmest places, to maturity, because the frosty nights begin too soon. Unfruitful as this country is, it affords food for some, though but few kinds of beasts, which furnish the natives with food and raiment. Of the wild game are white hares, reindeer, foxes, and white bears, who are fierce and mischievous, seals, &c. The Greenlanders have no tame animals, but a species of dogs who resemble wolves. The Greenlanders believe in the doctrine of the transmigration of souls, and have very singular and romantic notions concerning a future state. 
West Greenland was first peopled by Europeans in the eighth century. At that time a company of Icelanders, headed by one Ericke Rande, were, by accident, driven on the coast ; on his return he represented the country in such a favourable light, that some families again followed him thither, where they soon became a thriving colony, and bestowed on their new habitation the name of Graenland or Greenland^ on account of its verdant appearance. This colony was converted to Christianity by a missionary from Norway, sent thither by the celebrated Olaf, the first Norwegian monarch who embraced the true religion. The  
Greenland settlement continued to increase and thrive under his protection, and in a little time the country was provided with many towns, churches, convents, bishops, &c. under the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Drontheim. A considerable commerce was carried on between Greenland and Norway, and a regular intercourse maintained between the two countries till the year 1406, when the last bishop was sent over : from that time all correspondence was cut off, and all knowledge of Greenland has been buried in oblivion. 
The colony, from its first settlement, had been harrassed by the natives, a savage people, agreeing in customs, garb, and appearance, with the Equimaux. (See New Britain.) This nation, called Schrellings^Skrcelingues, or dwarfish people, from their small stature, at length prevailed over the Iceland settlers, who inhabited the w. district, and exterminated them in the 14th century ; insomuch that when their brethren of the e. district came to their assistance, they found nothing alive but some cattle and flocks of sheep running wild about the country. The Schrellings have a tradition that these were likewise exterminated, and affirm that the ruins of their houses and villages still appear. There are reasons, however, for believing that there may be still some descendants of the ancient Iceland colony remaining in the e. district, though they cannot be visited by land, on account of the stupendous mountains, perpetually covered with snow, which divide the two parts of Greenland ; whilst they have been rendered inaccessible by sea, by the vast quantity of ice driven from Spitzbergen, or East Greenland. One would imagine that there must have been some considerable alteration in the n. parts of the world since the 15th century, so that the coast of Greenland is now become almost totally inaccessible, though formerly visited with very little difficulty. Numerous attempts have been made in the last and present century to discover the e. district, but they have all proved abortive. In these attempts ore has been found, every hundred lbs. of which yielded 26 ounces of silver ; and sand, from which an eminent chemist extracted pure gold. 
It is thought the only practicable method of reaching that part of the country will be to coast n. about in small vessels, between the great flakes of ice and the shore ; as the Greenlanders have declared, that the currents continually issuing from the bays and inlets, and running s. w. along the shore, hinder the ice from adhering to the land ; so that there is always a channel open, through which vessels of small burden might pass, espe-. dally if lodges were built at suitable distances on]  the shore, for the convenience and direction of the adventurers. ,»'.',,

The ascent from the e. to the top of the Green mountain in Vermont is much easier than from the w. till you get to Onion river, where the mountain terminates. The height of land is generally from 20 to 30 miles from the river, and about the same distance from the New York line. The natural growth upon this mountain is hemlock, pine, spruce, and other evergreens ; hence it has always a green appearance, and on this account has obtained the descriptive name of Ver Mom, Green mountain. On some parts of this mountain snow lies till May, and sometimes till June. The chain extends through Massachusetts and Connecticut, and terminates in New Haven.

Greenville, a county in Washington district, S. Carolina. It is situate near the river Savannah, and is reputed to be the most useful and fruitful part of this province. Here a colony of Scotch established themselves under the direction of Lord Cardros; but afterwards abandoned their post through fear of the Spaniards in Florida. This county remained peopled by Europeans until 17^2, when Mr. Puny, a Swiss, native of Newchatel, encouraged by the English government and by Carolina, undertook to establish a Swiss company ; and in the same year transported hither 172 persons, who were afterwards followed by many others ; so that in a very short time there was a population of upwards of 300. These established themselves on the n. shore of the river Savannah, where they founded a city called Purrisburg, 36 miles from the river's mouth. The portion of territory taken by Mr. Purry belonged to a country which was called Great Yamassee Bluff. The colony still continued to increase ; and in 1734, its founder introduced 270 fresh Swiss people ; so that in less than two years its whole population exceeded 600 souls. The engagement or proposal made by the founder to the assembly, namely, that he would settle the most s. part of the frontier with these brave and valorous Swiss, was thus in a great measure fulfilled ; and the approbation of the undertaking was signified by an act passed in the year 1721, in which a gratuity of 400^. sterling was offered for each man who might settle here ; provisions and instruments for 300 persons being forthwith provided by the assembly, and the expences being borne upon the duties arising from the imports on Negroes. 
Purrisburg is one of the 11 divisions of wbfch S. Carolina should be formed, agreeably with the 43d article of the instruction given by the king of England to the governor ; in the which the former declares, that each of these districts should be formed of 20,000 acres or portions of territory, divided into squares of about 50 to each colonist. The territory of Greenville is watered by the river Mayo, which being united to the Cambage, forms with the sea the island of Edelano. 
The territory on the banks of this river was formerly inhabited by a nation of Indians called Ves« z    — : B  G R E  toes. Here is a very beautiful lake and an agreeable valley. The river of Port Royal runs 15 miles to the n. of the Mayo, with a good entrance, having 17 feet of water. The port is large, convenient, and secure for vessels, and runs up into a tract of country extremely pleasant and fertile, and certainly preferable to the other parts of Carolina. The river is divided into various branches : the port is 180 miles from the city of the Spaniards, San Agustin.

Guaca, an artificial mountain made by hand, of a conical figure, by the Indians in the time of their gentilism, and used by them as a burying place, where they had a custom of depositing with the corpse all the jewels and riches that belonged to the person whilst living. This account excited the avarice of the Spaniards, who set about opening the mountain in various parts, when some had the good luck, indeed, to find considerable wealth, whilst others only spent their fortunes in fruitless attempts : for the Indians noting the greediness of the Spaniards, hewed out several parts of the mountain, so as to resemble these receptacles of wealth ; and so diligent were they in this practice, that a Spaniard might be at the trouble of opening thirty different parts before he found one to reward him for his labour. These places are called guacas, and the part where they are found in the greatest numbers is in the territory of Cayambe in the kingdom of Quito.

==[[Guadalaxara|GUADALAXARA]]==, one of the three districts or audiences of Nueva Espana in N. America ; situate upon the s. coast. It extends from lat. 18° 50' to 24° 50' n. ; towards the n. e. it is bounded by San Luis, and s. e. by Valladolid ; towards the n. it has Durango, and to the w. it is washed by the sea and gulf of California, extending itself along the coast upwards of 200 leagues, from n. w. to s. w. The interior of the country is very irregular, and particularly towards the n. and the widest part. It comprehends seven provinces, which are, that of its own name, which is the principal, Xaiisco, Chiametlan, Zacatecas, Nueva Vizcaya, Culiacan, and Cinaloa. It enjoys different climates, according to the variety of its situation ; some part of it being in the torrid zone, and others in the temperate. It is, however, for the most part milder than the rest of Nueva Espana, and reputed healthy ; for, indeed, it is not uncommon to see persons whose age exceeds 100 years : nevertheless it is much infested with musquitoes, bugs, and other insects. The territory is for the most part mountainous and full of woods, having the appearance of a desert, and it is said that the Spaniards have taken the precaution of leaving it in this abandoned state, in order that strangers who visit it may not be encouraged to settle. It has   many silver mines, and some of gold of immense value have lately been discovered ; this precious metal being carried to Mexico on mules over the most craggy roads, in order any interception by strangers from sea. The rest of the country is most fertile, and produces wheat and maize in such abundance that the former yields the second 200 ibid, although the crops are sometimes destroyed by the locust  abundance of the finer and roots, is incre-  olives sorts of European fruit dible, and particularly of the sugarcane and cochineal : the honey also, made by bees, said to have no sting, is remarkably fine. The meadows abound in all kinds of cattle, and the woods in animals of the chase, in pines and oaks ; but they are, at the same time, full of wolves, snakes, and scorpions. Here grows a kind of medicinal pepper, which cures wounds, also a green stone, which we are assured is a specific remedy against the disease of the stone. Here are flowers of exquisite fragrance, fine drugs, and rich mines of silver, copper, and lead, and on the coast a pearl fishery. The Indians are cunning, treacherous, and weak : they use for arms bows and arrows, and their manner of attacking the Spaniards is by ambuscade, save when they are regularly headed by one of their caciques. The Spaniards of distinction live by commerce, and are masters of the mines ; and the inferior sort give themselves up to the pursuits of agriculture and breeding cattle. In each settlement are two Spaniards and one cacique, whose business it is to regulate the government, and maintain good order amongst the natives : these are very indignant at affronts, and pride themselves on their valour : they are indolent and lazy, and never labour but for great wages. Their clothing consists of a shirt and a square cotton mantle made fast in front by two buttons, and their smallclothes are of the same. They sleep upon mats made of reeds, and they adorn their necks, legs, and arms, with beads of green stones. Their principal diversion is dancing to the sound of a hollow piece of wood. Horseflesh and broth of maize are esteemed by them as delicious aliments, and chocolate and a chicha of maize their favourite drinks. Guadalaxara. The province which gives its name to the abovementioned district, and which is, as we have before said, a part of the same, is bounded e. and s; by the'province of Mechoacan, n, by that of Xaiisco, a corner of which is washed by the S. sea. Notwithstanding its situation, being under the torrid zone, it is healthy, temperate, and fertile, producing not only excellent woods for 176    building vessels, but much wheat and maize, as also other fruits of America and Europe, besides the rich treasures that are extracted from its mines. It is 50 leagues long, and nearly the same wide. 
[Guauai.axara, Intendancy of. This intendancy, a part of the kingdom of Nueva Gallicia, is almost twice the extent of Portugal, with a population five times smaller. Its greatest breadth is 100 leagues, from the port of San Bias to the town of Lagos ; and its greatest length is from s. to n. from the Volcan de Colima to San Andres Teul, 118 leagues. 
Guadalaxara is crossed from e. to vs. by the Rio de Santiago, a considerable river which communicates with the lake of Chapala, and which one day (when civilization shall have augmented in these countries) will become interesting for interior navigation from Salamanca and Zelaya to the port of San Bias. 
All the e. part of this province is the tableland and w. declivity of the cordi/leras of Anahuac. The maritime regions, especially those which stretch towards the great bay of Bayonne, are covered with forests, and abound in superb wood for shipbuilding. But the inhabitants are exposed to an unhealthy and excessively heated air. The interior of the country enjoys a temperate climate, favourable to health. 
The Volcan de Colima, of which the position has never yet been determined by astronomical observations, is the most w. of the volcanoes of New Spain, Avhich are placed on the same line in the direction of one parallel. It frequently throws up ashes and smoke. An enlightened ecclesiastic, who has made several very exact barometrical measurements, Don ManuelAbad, great vicar of the bishopric of Mechoacan, estimated the elevation of the Volcan de Colima above the level of the sea at 2800 metres (or 9185 feet). This insulated mountain, as is stated by M. Abad, appears only of a moderate height when its summit is compared with the ground of Zapotilti and Zapotlan, two villages of 2000 varas (or 5505 feet) of elevation above the level of the coast. It is from the small town of Colima that the volcano appears in all its grandeur. It is never covered with snow, but when this falls in the chain of the neighbouring mountains from the effects of the n. wind. On the 8th December 1788, the volcano was covered with snow for almost twothirds of its height ; and from the best meteorological considerations, we are induced to assign nearly 3200 metres (10,498 feet) for the total height of the Volcan de Colima. In the beginning of 1791, the above gentleman made the tour of the volcano by Sayula, Tuspan, and Co-   lima, without seeing the smallest trace of snow on its summits. 
According to a manuscript memoir communicated to the tribunal of the Consulado of Vera Cruz, by the intendant of Guadalaxara, the value of the agricultural produce of this intendancy amounted, in 1802, to 2,599,000 piastres, equal to 13,644,750 francs, or 568,531 /. sterling, in which there were computed 1,657,000 fanegas of maize, 43,000 cargas of wheat, 17,000 tercios of cotton, (at five piastres the tercio), and 20,000 pounds of cochineal of Autlan, (at three francs the pound). The value of the manufacturing industry was estimated at 3,302,200 piastres, (17,336,550 francs, or 722,35 11. sterling). 
The province of Guadalaxara contains, according to the latest accounts, two cities, six towns, and 322 villages. The most celebrated mines are those of Bolanos, Asientos de Ibarra, Hostiotipaquillo, Copala, and Guichichila near Tepic. 
The most remarkable towns are, Guadalaxara, Compostella, Aguas Calientes, Villa de la Purificacion, Lagos, and Colima. 
The population, in 1803, amounted to 630,500, and the extent of surface in square leagues was 9612, the number of inhabitants to the square league being 66.] 
Guadalaxara, the capital of the former province, and of the kingdom of Nueva Galicia ; founded in 1531 by Nurio de Guzman. It is of a somewhat hot temperature, great, populous, and handsome, through the symmetry of its buildings, squares, and streets, which are all straight, long, and wide, some being as much as 12 or 14 yards across. The houses are, for the most part, only one story high, so that they cover proportionably more ground. It has eight plasas, (public places), which are La Mayor, that of Santa Maria dc Gracia, Santo Domingo, Del Carmen, the small place of San Francisco, where the customhouse is, that of La Palma, and that of the parish of Sagrario, besides another of Nuestra Senora del Pilar. The temples are as follows : Oratorio de San Felipe Neri, convents of monks of St. Domingo, of the observers of San Francisco, of La Orden Tercera, of San Antonio, of San Agustin, of Nuestra Senora de la Merced, a house of entertainment of the barefooted Carmelites, a college which belonged to the regulars of the company, and hospitals of San Juan de Dios and of Bethlemiles, monasteries of the nuns of Santa Maria de Gracia and of Jesus Maria, both Dominicans, of Santa Monica, of the barefooted Carmelites, and the Beaterio de San DiegO, which is a receptacle for female children. Besides these it has two col- GUADALAXARA.  
17?  leoe.s, the one of San Joseph, which is the seminary of the cathedral, and another of San Juan Baptista, which was a house for studies belonging to the regulars of the company, where there were professors of writing and of the Mexican language, flie population of this city is greatly increasing, and consists of from 8 to 9000 families of Spaniards, Mustees, and Mulattoes, without those of Lhe Indians who inhabit the wards and settlements jf its precinct. It is the head of a bishopric, suffragan to Mexico, and erected in 1548 ; and in it resides thetribunal of the royal audience, established in ihe same year. It is situate on the shore of the river Barnaja or Esquitlan, which rises from the lake of Mechoacan, running with great rapidity 'o the s. w. ; and at the distance of four leagues it lias a very large fall, after which it enters the S. sea between Xalisco and Chiametlan. The cathe- ]ral is magnificent ; and the extensive plain on which it is situate is watered by various streams md fountains besides the aforesaid river : and all these tend to render the territory fertile in grain, berbs, and pastures. Five leagues distant from ;he city is a mountain of an extraordinary height, wd so steep that its ascent is impracticable for loaded horses; the other mountains surrounding this are covered with pines and oaks. The natives :)f this city are excellent mechanics, and excel particularly in making articles of tortoiseshell. It ;njoys delightful and salutary waters, which enter it on the w. through some aqueducts of good workmanship, and in which no expence was spared ; the same having been under the superintendency of Don Juan Rodriguez de Alboerne, Marquis of Altamira, oidor of the audience, then taken up by the Marquis del Castillo de Aiza, the president, and finished by Don Martin Blancas, >vho was also oidor. Streams also fertilize the environs of the town, and many cultivated estates, gardens, and orchards. The natives are for the nost part of a peaceable disposition, handsome, md industrious. [The population, according to he latest accounts, and as estimated by Humboldt, tmounis to 19,500 souls.] The city is 150 leagues si. with some inclination to n. w. of Mexico. Lat. U°B'n.

GUAD ==[[Alcazar|ALCAZAR]]==, a province and alcaldia^ mayor and real oi the mines of the kingdom of Nueva Espafia, and bishopric of Mechoaca : bounded by the windward coasts, the Nuevo Reyno de Leon, San Luis de Potosi, and the jurisdiction of the town of Valles, with which it joins between an e. and s. direction. It is more than 100 leagues long and 30 wide ; very fertile and pleasant, on account of its being irrigated by many rivers. The greater part of it is uncultivated ; inhabited by infidel Indians ; for the reduction of whom to the faith have been established many missions by the religious order of San Francisco. In its district are three mines of gold and silver, so abundant that they might, at a comparatively small expence, be made useful; but that the want, of means in the inhabitants renders the advantages offered unattainable ; these mines are in consequence abandoned and left unworked. The capital is the town of its name, founded by the order of the viceroy the Marquis of Guadalcazar, in 1611. It is small, of a cold and moist temperature, inhabited by 100 families of Spaniards, Mustees, and Mulattoes, whose only commerce is derived from the short crops of maize, and in breeding some large and small cattle and horses. It is 210 miles n. byw. of Mexico, in lat. 22°46'«. long. 100° 13' w. The other settlements of this jurisdiction are,  San Antonio de Tula, 
Santa Cecilia de las Palmas, 
San Juan Baptista de Jaumave,

Santa Ana de Naola, 
San Joseph de la Laxa,

Guadalcazar, with the dedicatory title of Santiago, a city of the province and government of Tucuman, founded by Captain Martin de Ledesma in 1628, with a good castle for its defence against the infidel Indians : these, nevertheless, destroyed it entirely at the end of the last century. 

==[[Guadalupe|GUADALUPE]]==, an island of the N. sea, one of the Larger Caribes or Antilles, called the Leeward : thus called by Christoval Colon, who was the first that discovered it, from the resemblance its mountains bore to some in Spain of the same name. The Caribes called it Curquera and Carriceura. Its discoverer with his Spanish followers were saluted upon their landing on this island with a shower of arrows shot by women, who immediately fled back with terror at hearing the firearms of the Spaniards. These immediately sacked and burnt the a a2   ■J MM" I,■ t  GUADALUPE.    cabins of the Indians, finding a great quantity of honey, wax, iron, bows and arrows, cotton, spun and unspun, hammocks, looms for weaving, a great quantity of fruit resembling ananas, incense, aloes, sandal wood, ginger, a kind of cinnamon tree, and various frui<s and herbs distinct from those of Europe ; also large parrots, partridges, tortoises, nightingales, and falcons. The houses were better and more furnished than those discovered in the other islands. 
This island is SO miles long, and nearly the same wide. It is 13 miles n. w. of that of Marigalante, and 73 n. of Martinique. The Spaniards kept it till 1635, when they ceded it to the French. The English took and sacked it in 1691 : they again became masters of it in 1703, commanded by Admiral Walker, and in 1759 under General Barrington. It is one of the largest and most useful that the French possess in America. It is divided into two parts by a canal of a league and an half long, and near 30 yards wide, the which is called the river Salado, navigable for vessels of 50 tons burthen. It runs from n. to s. and communicates with the sea at both extremities, and at each of these is a good bay. The e. part of this island is called La Gran Tierra ; the other, which is properly Guadalupe, is divided by a chain of mountains into Cabesterre on the w. and Basseterre on the e. It is 13 leagues and an half from n. to s. seven and an half at its greatest width, and 35 in circumference towards the s. point. In the mountains there is one which rises to an exceeding height, its top being out of sight : the same is called Del Azufre. It is a volcano, and vomits from a mouth of 100 feet wide a thick and black smoke, mixed with flakes of fire discernible at night. 
The whole island is divided into 22 parishes, 14 in Guadalupe and eight in La Gran Tierra : in this latter there is no water. The river Salado is 50 toises, or 300 feet, wide at its entrance by the Grand bay of the N. and then by degrees becomes so narrow, as to be in some parts only 90 feet across. Its depth also varies in the same manner ; for in many parts it is navigable for vessels of 500 tons, and in others will scarcely admit of those of 50. It has a smooth and clear current from one bay to the other, which is shadowed at intervals by the mangrove trees, which are upon its shores. The air here is temperate and healthy, and the water is equally good as the soil is rich, well cultivated, and by no means inferior to that of Martinique. This island is well fortified, and its productions are almost the same as those of the island last mentioned. Its commerce in sugar is very great, not to mention that of indigo, cotton, and other vege-  table productions with which it also abounds; such as cazava, tobacco, bananas, rice, and papas: some of the mountains are covered with trees, and at their feet extend spacious llanuras, irrigated by many streams and various springs of warm water. In the two bays quantities offish are caught. 
The forts in this island are Louis, in La Gran Tierra, to the e. of the smaller bay, to defend the vessels which lie at anchor there : near it a redoubt of six cannons, which has been built to command the shore. From this fort may be discovered not only the greater part of La Cabesterre, the large bay and many islands of the small one, but also, on a clear day, the mountains of Dominica. This fort belongs to the parish of Gosier in La Gran Tierra, where there are certain abysses, as Father Labat describes them, of which we have treated in that article. 
When the French established themselves here in 1635, as we have already observed, they began to attack the Caribes, who then possessed the island ; and to this war, which lasted three years, succeeded a terrible famine, in which the greater part of the colonists perished : then followed the invasions of its enemies, the disputes between the principal planters, and other disasters, which threatened the entire ruin of the colony ; until that, after 60 years, the French court began to form a just idea of its importance. Its prosperity, however, cannot be dated till after the peace of Utrecht. At the end of the year 1755, it contained 9624 white colonists and 41,000 slaves, 334 sugar presses, 15 planta- ' tions of indigo, 46,840 cacao trees, 11,700 tobacco plants, 2,257,725 of coffee, and 12,748,447 of cotton ; 4940 horses, 2924 mules, 125 asses, 13,716 bulls and cows, 11,162 sheep and goats, and 2455 pigs : again, in the year 1767, all the above articles are acknowledged to have been greatly increased; so that the product of this island is now computed at 46 millions of lbs. of sugar, 21 of coffee, 320,000 of cotton, and 8000 of cacao annually. 
[An attack was made on this island by the troops under the command of Lieutenantcolonel Beckwith on the 3d February 1810, at midnight ; which led to its capture, and subsequently to that of the whole of the French possessions in the W. Indies. 
The official value of the imports and exports of Guadalupe in 1810 were, imports 526,274/.; exports 100,850/. And the quantities of the principal articles imported into Great Britain in the same year were, of coffee of British plantation, 376 cwt.; of foreign plantation, 21,712 cwt. ; of sugar of foreign plantation, 279,071 cwt. ; of rum, 764 gallons ; and of cotton wool, 42,570 lbs.] 
Gtjadalupe, a settlement of Nueva Espana, in 2   G U A the corregimiento of Mexico ; situate on a mountain of a dry and barren soil, celebrated for the magnificent temple and sanctuary of Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe, who appeared in the year 1531 to Juan Diego, a Mexican Indian. It is of most beautiful architecture, and endowed with great riches, owing to the singular devotion in which it is held by the whole kingdom. The population of this settlement is composed of 60 families of Spaniards and Mustees, and 110 of Indians. It is one league from Mexico, to which place there is a causeway of a yard high, having at certain distances pyramids of marble, on which are engraved the mysteries of the rosary, adorned with the effigies of various saints; also in three arches stand the statues of the kings Philip IV. and Charles II. in whose time the same pyramids were constructed. At the egress towards Mexico is a bridge of the same name as the settlement. 
Guadalupe, another settlement, of the province and corregimiento of Sana in Peru, and of the bishopric of Truxillo. It is situate in the valley of Pascamayo, and is annexed to the curacy of Chepen. In its church is venerated a miraculous image of the Virgin, to whom the settlement is dedicated ; which image is a copy of that which was in Estremadura, and was placed here and richly endowed by the Captain Don Francisco Perez Lezcano, who gave for the building of the church and the convent all his fortune and property, the same being very considerable, on account of his having been liberated, by devoutly entreating the Virgin to pray in his behalf, from a shameful and ignominious death. Her festival is celebrated on the 8th of December ; and formerly no less than 8000 persons in the district used to assemble here, though of late the numbers have greatly diminished. 
Guadalupe, another settlement, of the province and corregimiento of Tunja in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada.

It was at its origin a convent of the religious Franciscans, of the Kecoletan order of San Pedro de Alcantara. It is situate in the road lying between Honda and Santa Fe, being a place of such traffic, that people came eagerly to settle here ; and the present number of inhabitants accordingly exceeds 300. It is one of the most benign temperatures in the whole kingdom : its territory is fertile, and abounding in many vegetable productions. It is 41 miles to the n. w. of Santa Fe, and 14 to the s. e. of Honda. G UAH I U AS, a river of the province and government of Los Llanos in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada.

They are a vagabond race, and much given to theft, although they are naturally docile and pa- "' G - They are allies of the Chiricoas, with whom  cifi  they were routed, in 1669, in the battle of Guayapege, by the Achaguas. They were first reduced, in part, to the faith in the year 1650, and in 1661 many of them settled together in a town. In 1668, however, they again fled to the woods, and a short time after arrived the missionaries, who formed them into a settlement, which is seven leagues distant from that of Panto.

==[[Guaicares|GUAICARES]]==, orGuAscuRES, a barbarous nation of Indians, of the province and government of Paraguay, to the e. of Concepcion. They are ferocious, inconstant, treacherous, and irreconcilable enemies to Europeans ; and notwithstanding the missionaries of the company of the Jesuits reduced some to the faith and to a civilized life, by causing them to live in a town, they have invariably done immense mischief by their incursions, and have destroyed whole towns, taking them by sur-   prise, and most particularly in the vicinity of Santa Fe.

==[[Guailas|GUAILAS]]==, a province and rorregimiento of Peru, bounded n. n. e. and e. by (he province of Conch ucos, s. e. and s. by that of Caxatambo, and w. by that of Santa. It is 45 leagues long from n. to s. and J 6 at its widest part. The temperature of the middle of the province is for the most part benign, and at either side cold, especially towards the e. part, which is that where runs the cordillera. It is watered by streamlets, which, being connected, form a river of some note, and which running towards the n. and receiving at the end of the province some waters from the province of Conchucos, turns w. and enters the sea with the name of Santa Fe. This province is sufficiently fertile, and affords wheat and other grain. Much sugar is made here, and from this many conserves, which are carried to Guanuco and Tarma, and to Lima. As the temperatures here are various, so the productions are those both of the sierras and of the valleys; but what is most remarkable is, that the whole year round there are crops of wheat, so that the grain is putting into the ground in one place, whilst in another it is ripe and ready to cut. It is the same with the fruits, which are very many and various. It abounds in cattle, of the wool of which is made the cloth of the country in the different manufactories. This province has always been rich in mines, as is proved by the remains of SO mills, which were used to grind the metals of gold and silver, some of which are still extracted. Here is one mountain of loadstone, and some of alum and copper, in a place which is called Yuramarca. Its repartimienlo was 140,000 dollars, and its alcavala used to amount to I 120 per annum.

==[[Guaimi|GUAIMI]]==, an ancient province and nation of the Indians, of the kingdom of Tierra Firme, forming at the present day part of that of Veragua. It lies in the cordillera, is of a most uneven territory, and of a moist temperature, owing to the constant rains •which prevail here. It produces fruit and vegetables without cultivation, some which resemble yucas, also potatoes, auyamas, oloes, and names, some maize, and grain in very small quantities, but abundance of pixibaes, which were the common aliment of the natives ;. the juice of the tree served them for wine, and the wood, which was very solid, for darts and arrows. In the mountains are lions, tigers, foxes, deer, little Peters (pericos ligeros), monkeys of three kinds, white, red, and black, zaynos, squirrels, peahens, partridges of two kinds, parrots, and many other birds, and also many venomous snakes. The Indians of this province used to adore a mountain, which is here called Nubu. They all, men and women, went entirely naked, and were reduced to the faith in 1624, by Father Fray Andrian de Ufeldre, of the order of Santo Domingo. They are at the present day all extinguished, and nothing but a small village remains.

GUA1RA, [or, as some French writers improperly spell it, Go ay re], a settlement of the province and government of Venezuela, founded by the governor of the same, Don Diego Osorio, in 1588. It has a celebrated port, defended by a castle, and much frequented by every kind of vessel, so that it carries on all the traffic and commerce of that province. It was attacked in 1739 by three English men of war, who were obliged to sheer off, owing to the great damage they received, and the very vigorous defence made against them. They left behind them an anchor, which is still preserved here as a trophy. Also, in 1743, it was besieged by 17 vessels, under the English Admiral Charles Knowles, who however, after experiencing great mischief, was obliged to desist from his enterprise.  
■J lilBJUJl'JI JJJ  GUAIRA.  
'•4| I,!.  
[If the port of Caravallada had not been abandoned by its inhabitants, Guaira would never have been but a small fishing town. .The difficulty of restoring to Caravallada its population, obliged them to choose another place to serve as a porf to Caracas ; and the ground on which Guaira now stands was selected for the purpose. This change was not advantageous ; for the sea is here rougher than it is in any other place. 
The city or (according to the Spaniards, who ^o not give the name of city, but where there is a cabildo), the town of Guaira is so surrounded with mountains,_ that the stones which fall from them often occasion the most serious injuries. There is no visibly horizon but that formed by the sea to the n. This accounts for the great heat experienced here for nine months in the year. The thermometer of Reaumur constantly rises to between 25° and 28°. Every year the months of July, August, and September, are marked by putrid and malignant fevers, which generally terminate fatally when they attack the newcomers from Europe. 
The streets of Guaira are narrow, badly paved, and out of a straight line; and the houses are meanly built. Nothing but the batteries that defend the town can be considered curious or regular; it being the only object of government to make of this place a military post and an outport to the capital. There are very few merchants resident here ; all the business being transacted at Caracas. The trader sometimes comes to Guaira to receive a cargo, purchased or shipped for him from Europe; but the goods are sent for sale to Caracas. Nothing is suffered to remain at Guaira but what may be for the consumption of the inhabitants. All goods exported are also brought and Avarehoused at Caracas, and are only sent to Guaira to be shipped. 
The road between the two places is steep, but good in dry weather. It becomes very bad in the rainy season. The distance is five leagues, which is performed by the loaded mules in five hours. The saddlemule performs it without altering his usual pace in three hours and a half. In leaving Guaira one ascends, according to the measurement made by Humboldt, about 684 fathoms, and descends 234 in arriving at Caracas. It is seldom that a traveller crosses the mountain in one journey. At the elevation of 576 fathoms there is an inn, called by the Spaniards Venta, where the traveller and his beast generally stop to rest. 
The water drunk at Guaira is from a small river, or rather rivulet; the source of which is on the mountain, at two leagues from the sea. This  water, not very agreeable to drink, because it is always tepid, contracts, in passing over the strata of sars'aparilla, an antivenereal virtue, which is noi altogether useless. 
The town of Guaira is governed by a commandant, who is also a civil judge ; that is to say, he is invested with the right of judging in the firs: instance all civil matters, subject to appeal to tin royal audience. His principal duty is to rendei an account every day to the captaingeneral of the occurrences in the roadstead. He cannot permit e stranger to go to Caracas without having first the order of the captaingeneral, which however is easily obtained, provided the alleged motives of the newly arrived person appear legitimate. 
The usual garrison of the place consists of s company detached from the regiment of Caracas, In time of war it is reinforced by other troops o; the line and the militia of Caracas. 
The population of Guaira is 6000 souls, ol which ISO are employed on board the gunvessels, and 711 form the garrison, ami man the guardacastas, or coastguarding vessels. The almoner performs all the clerical functions ; and the town has only one parish church, in which a curate officiates. 
Since this article was prepared for press, we have to insert some particulars respecting the dreadful calamity with which the unfortunate city of Guaira has been visited. On the 26th March 1812, a most dreadful shock of an earthquake was felt here : it lasted about two minutes. The city was laid in ruins, and numbers of the inhabitants were killed and buried in them. The city of Caracas, we understand, has experienced a still worse fate, and has been totally abandoned by the unfortunate inhabitants. The rocks and mountains were rent asunder ; and it is impossible foi pen to describe the devastation occasioned by this horrible explosion. Hundreds of the inhabitants of Guaira were seen mixed with heaps of ruins, and many of them still yet alive with their heads out, imploring assistance from their fellowcitizens, who, instead of affording them aid, were throwing themselves prostrate before images, beating their breasts, and imploring for themselves the protection of their saints. When the alarm had in some degree subsided, the bodies of the dead were sought for ; but we have not been able to ascertain the extent of the loss which this hapless city has sustained. 
Guaira is seven miles n. of Caracas. Lat. 10° 48' n Long. 67° &w.) 
Guaika, a province of the government of Para-  «niny, discovered in 1550; bounded n. by the unknown lands of Brazil, e. by the captaincy of St. Vicente, of the same kingdom, and s. and w. by Paraguay, the river Parana running between them. Jt is M7 leagues long from e. to w. and 132 wide n. si The territory is moist, the climate unequal, and the air unhealthy ; but it is fertile in all kinds of pulse, roots, maize, and other plants, which require little cultivation. It abounds greatly in tigers, vipers, snakes, and crocodiles, and in all kinds of animals. It produces many pomegranates and bitter dates, cedars, pines, and sabines, and in the hollows of these trees is found a great quantity of honey and wax. This country is irrigated by many rivers, and the most considerable are the Parapane, which collects many small tributary streams, the Tibajira, Itahua, Guatay, and Parana, the shores and woods of which are inhabited by birds of every description. At a tolerable depth from the surface of the ground are found certain stones, enveloped in a kind of very hard crust, of an oval figure : it is said that Avhen they come to their perfection the crust breaks with an explosion similar to that of a bomb, and discovers a stone, which is transparent and of great brilliancy, being most commonly of a red colour, although not unfrequently green and even violet. Their fioure is by nature so curious and so various that it is almost impossible to believe them not to be the work of art : suffice to say, they appear precisely the same as the French stones : the Spaniards first thought that they were emeralds, amethysts, and carbuncles, but were shortly undeceived. There are in this country many trees ■which distil balsamic gums. The couriers established by the Mamelucos and the Paulistas of Brazil obliged the Spaniards to abandon it, when they destroyed the Villa Rica and the Ciudad Real, ■which had been founded by the latter. Here grows a kind of fruit called quembe, which is of an oblong figure, pointed at the extremities, full of some small yellow grains, which are very sweet when sucked, but which when masticated fill the mouth with an insupportable acrid juice. The plant which produces this fruit is a kind of reed, which attaches itself to trees, and grows to a great height : it is also asserted, that if any of the seed should fall upon any rotten bark, it immediately throws downwards roots which fix themselves in the earth, and produce plants of the same species. Of the dates of which we have just spoken is made wine, and a drink which is very nutritive. The palms on which these dates grow, and which are found in all parts, afford a very acceptable repast to travellers when short of victuals, since their pith is very

The wild boars here have their navels on their loins, and it has been found necessary on killing the animal to cut away the same, since if this be not attended to the whole body would become corrupt. The honey is of excellent quality, but the wax could never be whitened. The Fathers Miguel de Ortega, and Tomas Filds, of the extinguished company of the Jesuits, entered in 1588 to preach to these Indians, and succeeded in establishing some flourishing and well governed missions, but which were delivered over to the clergy in 1767. The capital is the settlement of Nuestra Senora de Loreio.

Nueva Espafia. It is annexed to the curacy of Tampolon, and is much reduced, since it contains no more than 15 families of Mexican Indians, ■who dwell by the pass of the river of the Dcsague or wastewater of Mexico, being four leagues distant from thence : they call this spot the Paso de la Canoa, and they sow here some grain and seeds for their subsistence. It is 19 leagues s. of its capital. 

==[[Guajiros|GUAJIROS]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians, of the province and government of Santa Marta, in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, in the vicinity of Pamplona and Merida. They dwell in the settlement of Bozonata, and are dependent on the cacique, who, since their insurrection, has been ^uniformly nominated by the king. They are •warlike and valiant, and proved themselves of those who gave most trouble to their conquerors. This nation was originally so numerous that they amounted to above 70,000, and now they do not exceed 20,000 : they employ themselves in taking pearls from the river Hacha, and in making fine woven cotton stuffs : they journey on horseback, and have many of these animals, which from their Velocity they call aguilillias. They have a great commerce with the English and Dutch, and by these they are supplied with different articles of merchandise, slaves, firearms, and ammunition, with which they are very dexterous. They differed from the other Indians, in as much as they were laborious, and carried on merchandise, this permitting them to be sumptuously clothed, and to live in great wealth: the women wear a cloak sewed in the form of a large upper petticoat; and the men a short shirt and a cloak, with the ends thrown over the shoulders, also some breeches reaching down to the middle of the leg. They are continually eating the herb hayo, in Peru called coca, which gives them vigour and force, and they always carry with them a wallet. They proceed slowly in their journeys, having before them the wife loaded with her children, the fuel, and the different articles that they are carrying for sale. When they declare war with another nation, they all proceed on horseback ; and having come in front of the enemy, they cut the legs of the animals, lest any of their party should have the means of flying from the attack. The Sr. Monroy, bishop of Santa Marta, made noble but ineffectual exertions to reduce these barbarians to the Catholic faith ; his zeal was followed up with unabating ardour by Don Juan Nieto del Aguila and Don Joseph Xavier Arauz, but with as little success. Jn 1749, the king ordered four monks of the order of the Jesuits to undertake their conver-   sion, and they were about to proceed to the calling, when they were countermanded by his Majesty, and in their stead were sent some monks of the order of the Capuchins, who were at that time occupied in the reduction of the Chimilas Indians, and who, in fact, have the charge of the same at the present day, though even their labours are but uselessly bestowed. It is not many years since that the cacique Don Cecilio, assisted by a gentleman of the name of Andaluz, proposed to this court (of Spain) the conquest of the Guajiros, and the project having been laid before the viceroy of Santa Fe, was approved, but never put into effect; from all which it should seem that some superior cause stood in the way of bringing about any reduction of this nation to the faith.

It is 30 leagues long e. w. and 10 wide ; it was separated from that of Caxamarca, and was made a corregimienlo in 1759, the Count de Superunda being viceroy. It is not wanting in vegetable productions, such as maize, wheat, barley, papas, and fruits of the sierra and the valleys, in as much as it enjoys some good temperatures, though it is for the most part cold ; and in this view only does it differ from the province of Caxamarca, its productions as well as commerce, in all other respects, corresponding with those of that province. Here are breeds of all sorts of cattle, particularly sheep, of the wool of which much country cloth is made in the great manufactories that are found here. Here are mines of gold and silver, and some of the silver ones are worked, together with those of the mountain of Algumarca, of San Joseph de Achocomas, and of the real De Carangas ; others of gold are worked also, though but few of them. In the mountain of Aupillan is a good vein of iron, and in other parts are found sulphur and loadstone.   This province is watered by certain rivers, the most considerable of which is the Tablachaca, which rises in the vicinity of a lofty snowy mountain to the s. e. at the end of the province, &c. called Pallagatos : this river receives those of Angasmarca and Guachaca, and, running w. through the confines of the province of Conchucos, enriches the stream of the Santa, flowing with its whole waters into the same. The other river of note is that which is called Guamachuco, and rises from a lake close to the settlement, and which, following a n. course, receives other smaller streams, and then incorporates itself with the river of Las Criznejas, of the province of Caxamarca, which river enters the Maranon by an e. course, as do those of Chusgon, Santisbamba, Iracapampa, and others. Here are few settlements, but many estates well peopled, and having for the most part workshops and buildings, and even churches. The inhabitants amount to 11,000: its repartimiento was small. The capital is the settlement of the same name, situate on a very cold spot ; the other settlements are, 
Sinsicapa, Malin, 
Otusco, Huancai,

Its length is 82 leagues n. s. and its width 30 e. w. being in other parts no more than 12. This province is nothing more than an extensive valley, through which runs the Maranon, which river rises six leagues beyond the s. boundary of the province, from the lake Lauricocha, of the province of Tarma : its waters are increased by various other riversand streams, which enter it on either side ; and some of these are very considerable. The temperature is cold towards the s. and elsewhere it is for the most part benign. To the 11. however, in the curacy of Huacaibaraba, are found some estancias of such intense    G U A heat the whole year round, that it is to this cause that the (lark colour, which renders the inhabitants here distinct from those of the other provinces, is attributed, and that they are called Zambos. Here is grown an abundance of seeds and fruits: there are large breeds of cattle, from beautiful grove of poplars, and a good church,  well peopled, but at present reduced to a very scanty number of Indians, who live by cultivating some sorts of grain and garden herbs, which they cany for sale to the city, from whence this settlement is distant half a league to the s. e. It has a  the wool of which is made a considerable portion of country cloth, the same being the principal article of commerce. This province produces some coca; and some few years back were discovered some silver mines, which promise well, as also another of quicksilver, in the mountain called Clionta. Near the settlements of Aguamira and Bnnos are fountains of hot water ; and in the vicinity of the latter settlement are seen the vestiges of a stone road made by art, some similar to which are found in other provinces, as in those contiguous with Conchucos, Tarma, and others, the direction of the same being s. of Caxacarca, and the route by which the Incas used to travel. Some say that this road led as far as Quito : be that as it may, it gives proofs of a very sumptuous work ; and not far from it are discovered some monuments of antiquity, such as a palace for bathing, in the building of which the stones are so neatly knit together that the union is scarcely visible ; also the ruins of a temple and a fortress on the top of a mountain, towards the side which is laved by the river Maranon ; there is likewise a castle at some distance from the fort. In this province is found the stone called yEtites, or of the eagles ; also there are several kinds of wood peculiarly adapted for building, amongst which the cedar particularly abounds, the same being cut on the mountains towards the e. The settlements of its jurisdiction are.

This province was conquered and united to the empire by the Inca Viracocha, eighth emperor. The capital is the city of the same name, founded by Francisco Pizarro, in 1539, in an extensive and beautiful plain, which is watered and fertilized by a river rising in the mountains. It has also the names of San Juan de la Victoria, in memory of the retreat of Manco Inca, after that he had well nigh conquered the Spaniards in a bloody battle ; and also of San Juan de la Frontera, although no one calls it by any other name than that of Guanianga. Its temperature is so benign that it is never incommoded either by heat or cold, and enjoys a constant spring. There is no town in Peru that can compare with it in buildings: these are all of stone, very handsome and convenient, and having gardens and orchards annexed, both for recreation and use. The public places and squares are grand, and the entrances to the city adorned with rOws of trees. It has two parishes, with four curacies, a college, which is a royal seminary, with the title of San Christoval, and enjoying the privileges of an university ; softie convents of the religious Orders of Santo Domingo, San Francisco, San Agustin, La Merced, San Juan de Dios ; and a college which belonged to the regulars of the company of Jesuits ; also two monasteries for nuns, one of Santa Clara, and another of Carmelites ; three, religious houses of entertainment, called San Francisco, De Paula, De San Agustin, and De Agortizantes, called De la Buena Muerte; and a curacy entitled Santa Maria Magdaleha, composed of In-   190

In its territory is a fountain, the water of which, when congealed, is converted into a white and transparent stone, of which are made glass for windows, figures, and articles of ornament. It has also mines of silver, gold, and loadstone, but few of them are worked. It is the bead of a bishopric erected by Paul V. in the year 1609, and suffragan to Lima. It comprehends eight provinces, which are, Guanta, Vilcas Huaman, Andraguailas, Guancabelica, Angaraes, Castro Virreyna, Parinacocha, and Lucanas. The natives are courteous, affable, liberal, and conversant as well in the sciences as in matters of business. This city contains many noble and rich families, and not a few descended from the first conquerors. It is the native place of the most illustrious Senor Don Manuel Geronimo de Romani, canon of this holy church, bishop of Panama and Cuzco ; also of the Marquis of Valdelirios, actual counsellor, chamberlain of the royal and supreme council of the Indies, and of Dona Maria Teresa Cruzategui y Munivi, Marchioness of Feria, a lady of singular talent and education, possessing a knowledge of Latin and philosophy, the belles lettres, and different languages.

==[[Guanare|GUANARE]]==, a settlement of the missions that are held by the Capuchin fathers, in the province and government of Guayana ; situate on the shore of the river of its name. [Guanare received from its founders, in 1593, the civil and religious institutions given at that period to every village then c c      W-T  I  GUANARE.  
[established ; that is, a cabildo and a curate. Those who selected the situation deserve praise for the wisdom of their choice. Jn the first place, a river, which has given its name to the town, furnishes the inhabitants with good water, for drinking as well as for the purposes of culture, and for the use of their flocks. In the next, there is nothing to prevent the winds circulating well through the town, and refreshing the atmosphere. 
If one considers the situation of Guanare with respect to rural works, it will be seen that the lands in the e. part are fertile, and fit for every description of produce; and that to the 5. and e. the pasture of the immense plains are evidently destined by nature for the propagation of cattle. It is in this speculation that the inhabitants are chiefly engaged. Their greatest wealth is in cattle, the number of which is infinite. They sell a number of oxen for the consumption of the province, and also a number of mules for its use. The surplus is exported from Coro, Porto Cavello, or Guayana. Formerly very good tobacco was cultivated in the valleys of Tucupio and Liporora, as well as on the banks of the river Portuguesa ; but since the government monopoly, these plantations have suffered the fate of all those that unfortunately were not within the jurisdiction designed by the ministers for the cultivation of tobacco on the king's account. The population of Guanare amounts to 12,300 persons. The streets are in a line, broad, and formed by houses, if not magnificent, of a very passable construction. There is an hospital with a very pitiful revenue; but the parish church is large, handsome, and ornamented in a superior manner. It owes a part of its splendour to the possession of Our Lady of Comoroto, whose virtues and miracles oblige us to give an account of her apparition, and of the causes of the great concourse of people which she attracts from the neighbouring provinces. It was ascertained by an investigation made by D. Carlos de Herrera, rector (curerector) of the cathedral of Caracas, that in 1651, an inhabitant of the name of John Sanchez made a journey from the town of Espiritu Santo to Tucuyo, by a road which led over some dry savannas. A Cacique stopped him to acquaint him that a woman exceedingly beautiful had appeared to him in a ravine which he pointed out to him, and that she had told him to go with his people, and find the whites, who would make him throw water on his head, as the only means of securing his way to heaven. Sanchez, being in a hurry, deferred the examination of the matter until his return, which was ip eight days. The Cacique was punctual in re-  pairing to the same spot at this period, continuing as much affected with what the woman had said tc him as he was on the first day. The alcaldes wen informed that the whole Cacique nation would repair to the church to receive baptism. This wai punctually executed, and in less than one houi more than 7000 souls were put into the way of salvation. 
After this solemnity, all the daughters and children of the baptized Indians beheld the woman ir the ravine where she had made her first appearance As it was the place where they went to fetch water, they always stopped longer than their errand required, and were often scolded and beaten by theii parents. The same fault and the same chastisement were repeated every day, until at last the children declared that a woman appeared to them, under so beautiful a form that they could not wearv themselves with admiring her. 
No adult could see her ; but on the report of the children, prodigious virtues were attributed to the waters in this ravine. What carried their belief tc its height was the bishop Uiego de Banos having sent some of this water to Madrid in 1699 ; as it arrived there, after a voyage of ten months, as fresh as if it had been just taken from the ravine. The governor D. Nicholas Eugenio de Ponce sent some to his wife, at the Canary islands. It arrived equally fresh. 
People who are in want, repair with a lighted lamp to bathe in the ravine. Every where they send for this water. Even the flint stones have become relics, and are worn about the neck. What is very singular, is that every body had an entire faith in these miracles, excepting the very Cacique who had given the information to Sanchez. He persisted in an invincible unbelief. 
On the 8th of Sept. 1652, they wished to force him to assist at the divine ceremonies ; he refused, and retired to his dwelling, which was two leagues off. He was no sooner arrived there than the Virgin appeared to him arrayed in a splendour which shone as bright at midnight as the meridian sun. Immediately the Cacique saw her, he said to her, " O madam! dostthoucome here also, thou mayest as well return, 1 am not more disposed to obey thee ; owing to thee, I find myself in trouble ; I wish to retire to the woods, which I have to repent having ever left." The Indian's wife said to her husband, " Do not insultthe woman, be notof a bad heart." He then took his bow and arrow to shoot the Virgin ; but she approached near enough to him to prevent it. He wished to seize her, she vanished, and the room was again in darkness. In]    G U A 
"tbe same time the Cacique felt something in his land. They lighted a fire, and discovered it to be i figure of the Virgin, which he had concealed in ,he thatch of his cottage : he fled into the woods, Hid died of a bite of a serpent. 
A child of 12 years old found this little figure ; lie attached it to the relic which he wore about his leek. But this event was no sooner known than [he people went to find it in a procession. They :arried it to the church, and soon raised a temple more worthy of her, where all the faithful continually present her the homage of the most profound veneration. To vie with Our Lady of Loreto, she only wants the wealth of the Italian Virgin, for she is quite as much venerated, and quite as powerful. 
Guanare is in lat. 8° 12' n. and long. 69° 15' w. It lies 193 miles s.s.w. of Caracas, 64 s. e. of Truxillo, and 70 n. e. of Varinas.] 
Guanare, a town of the province and government of Venezuela, founded by Captain Juan Fernandez de Leon in 1593, by order of tbe governor D. Diego de Osorio, near the river from whence it takes its name, and also near another which surrounds it ; each of these rivers abounding in fish. It is of a healthy temperature, though extremely hot. Here are large breeds of cattle, owing to the fine pastures of its extensive llanuras and sabanas. Here also are produced great quantities of cacao, tobacco, fruits, and garden herbs. In its church is venerated a miraculous image, with the dedicatory title of Nuestra Sefiora de Comoroto, which appeared here in 1652 ; and very numerous are the pilgrimages made to this shrine from all the immediate provinces.

[==[[Guanaxuato|GUANAXUATO]]==, a province, wholly situated on the ridge of the cordillera of Anahuac, and the most populous in New Spain. The population is    also more equally distributed here than in any of the other provinces. Its length, from the lake of Chapala to the n. e. of San Felipte, is 52 leagues ; and its breadth from the Villa de Leon to Celaya, 31 leagues. Its territoral extent is nearly the same as that of the kingdom of Murcia ; and in relative population it exceeds the kingdom of the Asturias. Its relative population is even greater than that of the departments of the Hautes-AIpes, Basses-Alpes, Pyrenees Orientales, and the Landes. The most elevated point of this mountainous country seems to be the mountain De los Llanitos, in the sierra de Santa Rosa. Its height above the level of the sea is 2815 metres, or 9235 feet. The cultivation of this fine province, part of the old kingdom of Mechoacan, is almost wholly to be ascribed to the Europeans, who arrived there in the 16th century, and introduced the first germ of civilization. It was in these n. regions, on the banks of the Rio de Lerma, formerly called Tololotlan, that the engagements took place between the tribes of hunters and shepherds, called in the historians by the vague denominations of Chichimecs, who belonged to the tribes of the Pames, Capuces, Samues, Mayolias, Guamanes, and Guachichiles Indians. In proportion as the country was abandoned by these wandering and warlike nations, the Spanish conquerors transplanted to it colonies of Mexican or Aztec Indians. For a long time agriculture made more considerable progress than mining. The mines, which were of small celebrity at the beginning of the conquest, were almost wholly abandoned during the 17th and 18th centuries ; and it is not more than 30 or 40 years since they became richer than the mines of Pachuca, Zacatecas, and Bolanos. They are also infinitely richer than those of Potosi ever were, and afforded, from 1796 to 1803, near 40,000,000 of dollars in gold and silver, or very near 5,000,000 of dollars annually ; that is, somewhat less than onefourth of the whole quantity .of the gold and silver from New Spain ; yet these mines, productive as they were, did not employ more than 5000 Avorkmen of every description. 
There are in the intendancy of Guanaxuato three cities, viz. Guanaxuato, Celayo, and Salvatierra ; four towns, viz. San Miguel el Grande, Leon, San Felipe, and Salamanca; 37 settlements, 33 parishes, 448 farms (or haciendas), 225 individuals of the secular clergy, J 70 monks, and 30 nuns ; and in a population of more than 180,000 Indians, 52,000 subject to tribute.

[experiments made by Humboldt and M. Roxas, is 96°. 3 of the centigrade thermometer, or 205°. 3 of Fahrenheit. 
The population of this intendancy, in 1803, was 517,300; the extent of surface in square leagues 911, and the number of inhabitants to the square league 586. 
The most remarkable towns of this intendancy are the following: Guanaxuato the capital, Salamanca, Celaya, Villa de Leon, San Miguel el Grande.] 
[Gv a naxuato, or Sant a FedeGp AN ==[[Ajuato|AJUATO]]==, the capital of the above province. The building of this city was begun by the Spaniards in 1551.

==[[Guancabelica|GUANCABELICA]]==, a town and capital of the province of Angaraes in Peru, the head of the government ; founded in 1572 by the viceroy of that kingdom, Don Francisco de Toledo, second son of the Count of Oropesa, in whose memory he gave it the title of Villa Rica de Oropesa. It is situate In a broken and uneven glen, formed by the Cordillera ; is one of the grandest and richest cities in that kingdom ; it is also populous, and the temperature is extremely cold, and the weather constantly changing, as it is not uncommon to expeperience in the same day rain, frost, hail, and tempests of thunder and lightning. The buildings arc of stones, more or less porous, which are indurated by certain streams of warm water found in that neighbourhood. This settlement is watered by a stream, which in the rainy season swells to a considerable size, from being joined by several ©titers flowing clown from the neighbouring moun-   tain : it is crossed in various parts by bridges, an one of these is of stone, and has three arches ; an another of two stones put together in their rou°- or undressed state. This town is the residence" the governor, who originally was always an oidc of the audience of Lima, by commission, and wit him two royal officers, an alguazit mayor, and th procurator of the town. It "has been much note for its great mine of quicksilver, discovered i 1563 by Enrique Garces, a Portuguese ; and thi is the only one which is worked throughout a America ; not that there are wanting many othe fine mines of this metal, but that the quantity pre duced from this is found sufficient for working th metal of all the silver mines of Peru. The mod of using this metal was discovered by Pedro Fei nandez de Velaseo, in 1571. The aforesaid min is farmed and worked by a company of 40 miners which number is not always complete; and witl these the king fixes upon a price that he shall pa' for each quintal of quicksilver; when the whole ex tracted from the mines is regularly poured intoth royal coffers. In the working of these mines, ; Vast number of the inhabitants of the settlement as sist, as do also the Indians. The appointment ti this labour is called mita; and very many are thos> that perish in the employ. This mine does no produce so much metal at the present day as it for inerly did, owing to the great depth it has ac quired, as also from a fire which happened ii 1760, and which threatened to render it useless however, this only led to the discovery of othe mines ; and the fire has been by great labour ex tinguished. The town has in its vicinity 12, kilns for doing the business of the mine ; and tin mouth of the mine is one league distant from tin town. In 1735, the king took away the govern ment from the oidors of the audience of Lima, am ordered that in their place should be elected mei intelligent in affairs of mineralogy.

==[[Guanchaco|GUANCHACO]]==, a settlement and port of the province and corregimiento of Truxillo in Peru. It is poor and scanty, and the natives maintain themselves by catching fish and carrying their spoil to a market at the capital, or other place in the vicinity, also by assisting vessels or by directing the boats making the port. This, although it is but little sheltered from the winds, is much frequented by vessels coming from Lima and Panama ; and these would suffer imminent hazard of being wrecked upon the bar of sand and rocks which lies at the entrance of the port, but for the practice and cunning of the natives. The church is large and beautiful, and being built on a lofty eminence, serves as a direction and landmark to vessels. In it is venerated an image of Nuestra Senora del Socorro, held in great devotion. M. de la Marliniere says, that this port of the S. sea is in Brazil, forgetting that the coasts of Peru and Chile are exactly on the opposite side of America to those of Brazil.

It is of a benign and healthy climate, celebrated for its good manufactures and woollen stockings made by the Indians, and with which article a great trade is maintained with the provinces of Popayan, Choco, and Barbacoas. In its district is a rich country estate called Elen. The settlement is seven miles n. e. of Riobamba, on the shore of the river of its name ; in lat. 1° 34' s. and long. 78° 28' w.

==[[Guanoas|GUANOAS]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians, on the confines of the province and government of Paraguay, to the n. ; amongst whom dwell manyrefugee Spaniards. Of these Indians we know nothirg more than that they are very idle, and lead a loitering life through the woods, and on the shores of the rivers, maintaining themselves by fishing and the chase. This nation is above 100 leagues distant from the settlements of the missions of Paraguay. 
==[[Guanozan|GUANOZAN]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Loxa in the kingdom of Quito; situate on the bank of a stream which enters the river Giron. 
==[[Guanta|GUANTA]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru, bounded n. and n. w. by the province of Xauxa, n. e. and e. by the mountains of the Andes, and s. and s. w. by the province of Angaraes, and partly by the jurisdiction of Guamanga and that of Castro Virreyna ; on the s. e. it touches upon the provinces of Andahuailas and Vilcashuaman : it extends in length, from the province of Xauxa to that of Andahuailas, 60 leagues in a direction from n. w. to s. e. being 40 leagues wide. Its situation is, for the most part, on heights or midlands, where the cold is considerable ; the rest consists of q uebradas or broken glens, of a good and even warm temperature, although it is altogether scarce of llanuras. In this province are cultivated all kinds of fruits and seeds, nor is it without sugarcane grounds. Towards the part bounded by the mountains, are gathered tolerable crops of coca and other fruits. Here are breeds of all kinds of cattle, although not in the greatest abundance ; also various estates belonging to the settlements of San Pedro de Guanta and San Juan de Tambos, where the quantity of coca is   the greatest, the crops being gathered three times a year, and regularly exceeding 88,000 arrobas, of 32 lbs. each, and the same being carried to Guancabelica, and other parts where there are mines, and sold at eight dollars the arroba: this, indeed, forms the greater part of the commerce of this province. In the woods are found many curious things, such as dragon's blood, cinnamon, bees honey, which is found in the trunksof trees; and .orae of these are so large that eight men, with their arms extended, cannot encompass them. Here are likewise bees which breed under ground, tigers of more beautiful skin than those of Africa, mountaincats, hedgehogs, bears, wild boars, cows, and wild horses, turkeys, doves, partridges, also a tree called pi/co, the shade of which causes an universal itching over the whole body to those who come near its influence, and lastly, many rare herbs, which would afford much occupation and amusement to the botanist. There is scarcely any silver mine here worth mentioning ; but there are mines of lead and of salt so abundant, that of this latter article large quantities are taken to the immediate provinces' for working the silver. Amongst the rivers of the province, the largest is that which flows down through the province of Xauxa, and which rises in the province of Tarraa from the lake called Cinchaicocha, the same preserving the name of the Maranon, which was given it by the Spaniards, although amongst the Indians it still preserves the name of Angoyaco. This river divides this province from that of Angaraes ; and making an inflexion from s. to. to e. forms a peninsula called the island of Tayaeaxa: it abounds in many delicate sorts of fish, and has, for a pass into the aforesaid province, a strong bridge, the same being the route by which lays the royal road leading from Cuzco, and called the Bridge of Iscucacha. There is also another bridge, called Criznejas, on the other side of the island, in the settlement of Mayoc. The inhabitants amount to 10,000, of all sexes and ages. The principal settlement is San Pedro de Guanta, six leagues from the city of Guamanga. Its corregidor used to have & repartimiento of 1 19,200 dollars, and it paid an alcuvala of 953 dollars yearly. The population consists of the following settlements, divided into 12 curacies : S. Pedro de Guanta, S. Juan de Chilcas,

==[[Guanuco|GUANUCO|Huanuco]]==, a province and corregimienlo of Peru, bounded n. and e. by the province of the infidel Indians, s. e. and s. by the province of Tarma, and w. by the s. part of the province of Guamalies. Its temperature is benign and healthy, its territory fertile and abounding in fruit and seeds. In it is gathered a tolerable quantity of pepper and cotton, and here are good breeds of cattle ; also at the entrance of the mountainous part much coca, which is usually carried to Tarma. The district is, as it were, situate in a valley, which begins at Tarma, and ends in the mountains. This province is watered by two rivers, the one called Pilcomayo, which flows from Tarma, the other Visacaca, in the limits of the province of Guamalies : these rivers unite at a small distance from the city of Guanuco, and run n. through the mountains. Contiguous to this province are the Panataguas Indians, amongst whom there were formerly good reducciones ; but these have been lost through the natives having retired to the mountains, after having killed their pastors of the religious order of S. Francisco. At present, however, there are existing other missions, which are kept up by the monks of the college of Ocopa ; such is the settlement of Nuestra Senora de la Rosa, and such are many others which have not yet acquired any very great perfection. La Martinicre, following the errors in the descriptions of Juan Laet, says that this province is watered by the river Maranon, although the same is 22 leagues to the w. in the province of Tarma. It has only g  three settlements with curacies, and 14 others annexed : the which arc, S. Miguel de Huacar, Cairan, Santa Marta del Valle, Pillao, Churubamba, Conchamarca, Pachabamba, Cani, 
Pachacoto, Acomayo, 
Pumacucho, Churubamba, 
Chinchac, Llacon,

Its repartimiento was 50,000 dollars, and it used to pay an afcavala of 400 yearly. 
Of the same name is the capital of this province, founded by Gomez de Alvarado, in 1539, with the title of Leon de Guanuco de los Caballeros. It was afterwards reestablished by Pedro Barroso, in 1540, and then finally perfected by Pedro de Puelles in 1542. Its first inhabitants were principally those who followed the royal standard in the wars of Pizarro and Almagros. Shortly after its first establishment in the spot called Guapuco el Viejo, it was removed to where it now stands, by order of the Licentiate Vaca de Castro, governor of Peru. In the time of the viceroy the Marquis of Canete, there was given to it the title of Most Noble and Most Loyal, and a shield for its arms. It was a very populous and large city, of an handsome plant and beautiful edifices; its cabildo, which consisted of officers and corresponding employments, was much distinguished, and the corregidor's jurisdiction extended to the provinces of Conchucos, Guamalies, Caxatamba, Chinchaicocha, Tarma, and Guailas ; and even after that there were made separate corregimientos y there was reserved to this the authority of chief judge of appeals in the first instance. At present it is reduced to a miserable village. It stand's in the royal road of the Incas ; and every here and there are to be seen the ruins of some of their superb edifices, and most conspicuous amongst the rest the royal palace and temple of the sun. It is near the river Pilcomayo, which passes by, united with the Visacaca. Its territory is pleasant and fertile in all kinds of fruit of excellent quality, and of which are made conserves much esteemed at Lima and in the other provinces. The parochial church, as well as its three convents, are extremely poor ; so also are its inhabitants, although they are composed of some of the most noble families ; indeed, the only mark of grandeur remaining to it is the privilege of receiving in its cab Mo the corrcgidors and ministers of the five provinces aforesaid, which were formerly subject to its jurisdiction. It is in lat. 10° 6' s. and long. 75° 3& w.    *  goo

It should be observed, that some vessels have been known to have arrived from the abovementioned spot as far as the lake of Areo. From the mouths of the Areo, it was usual to navigate as far as the mission of Caicara or Guayuta ; but this practice has been put a stop to, through the excessive thickness of the trees and shrubs on either bank of the river. It is thought, however, that these, as well as all other rubbish that mighthave collected, would have been cleared away by the contraband traders in cattle, but for some further difficulties arising in the number of shoal places, such as to oblige them to cause the cattle to pass by means of fording or swimming ; and this more especially near the aforesaid mission of Caicara : from thence they proceed to the settlement of Punceres, and in the place which is called the Capo or channel, they form certain rafts, for which the number of trunks of trees found here afford every facility.

Here are numerous plantations of sugarcane, tobacco, indigo, and coffee; and of these the product is so large that there is an annual exportation to France -of 30,000 tons. It is a colony much prized, not so much from what has been just stated, as from the circumstance, that not less than 160 vessels, of from 150 to 500 tons each, arrive here annually, loaded with rich merchandise and provisions, by each of which is returned in favour of France a sum of more than 40,000 dollars in specie ; so that it produces, for the mother country, more than a million of dollars, besides its natural productions. This city not being able to consume even a fourth part of the effects which enter it, carries on a very great trade with the other Spanish ports of the Havana, Santa Marta, Cartagena, Tierra Firme, Nicaragua, and Honduras.

In the market of this city are bought paltas, pomegranates, strawberries, gat/abas, pallillos, pears, &c. Its rivers are few, although there are various streams which irrigate it, and which owe their origin to the rains and the snow with which the mountains are continually covered. In the settlement of Yauli are found fountains of hot medicinal water, good for the cure of many infirmities. The river which passes through Lima rises in this province ; and some ot its waters flow into the province of Canete, passing through the province of Mala. It is stocked with fish, with which the province is supplied, and the surplus of which is carried to be sold on the coast. This province has many silver mines, which were formerly abundant ; and a few, at the presentday, arewor'ked, which afford only moderate profit. The mine called Nuevo Potosi has been celebrated for the abundance of metal and riches which it has yielded. The population consists of the 52 following settlements.

Mr. La Martiniere, from some source, which we have not been able to discover, asserts that the city of Santiago de la Estramedura (the capital of the kingdom) was founded on this spot. The father Alonso de Ovalle, who wrote the history of Chile, the chronologist Antonio de Herrera, and the Inca Garcilaso, say nothing of this sort; and no doubt the great author of whom we speak, took this apocryphal intelligence, as he did much other, from Juan Laet, although even here we have not been able to discover it.

It was one of the best supplied and best defended garrisons when it was taken by Gonzalo Ximenez de Quesada in 1537; and he gave it the name of Espiritu Santo, having arrived there on this festival. In sacking it, the Spaniards obtained great wealth, from its having been the residence of the greater part of a very opulent nobility. In its public square still stands one of the idols adorned by the Indians. These were very powerful and great, not only from the considerable commerce that they carried on in salt, but from their being well acquainted with the art of founding metals and of working jewels, this being peculiar to them in contradistinction to all the other Indians of the same kingdom : indeed, several stoves or furnaces, used no doubt for the above purposes, have been since discovered. When Fr. Pedro de lobar was curate here, there was also discovered a large flat piece of marble which shut up the entrance of a tomb, in which was deposited the remains of a giant. The doctrinal curate of the Indians here was the Fr. Juan Ladrada, of the order of St. Domingo, afterwards bishop of Cartagena. Its population at the present day may amount to 200 Indians, and as many other Spaniards. It is eight miles n. of Santa Fe. Guatavita, a lake of the above province and kingdom, celebrated for the immense riches which were thrown into it by the Indians, by way of adoration which they were accustomed to offer it, and from whence no inconsiderable part has been extracted by the industry of the Spaniards. It lies amongst some snowclad mountains, which from it have the appearance of a large bowl of a league in circumference. It is very deep, and the water crystal and pure, since whatever is thrown into it, it regularly throws on shore. On its bank stood   one of the finest temples of those celebrated in th< times of the Indian gentilism. Hernan Perez wai the first who discovered a plan of draining it, foi the purpose of extracting its wealth, when here, covered as much as was equal to 4000 dollars This example was followed by Antonio de Sepul veda, who was equally successful, besides finding ai emerald of excessive value.

Its temperature is generally hot am moist, and consequently unhealthy. Tlie territon is for the most part mountainous, and abounding ii exquisite kinds of wood. It has many valleys ant llanuras, which, although small, are very fertile ii the most delicate fruits not only of America bu Europe. The maize, which is much better thai that of Nueva Espana, yields regularly 30a bushel for one ; and it is not less rich in cacao, whicl used to pass instead of coin, and now produce sufficient for the supply of the whole kinodom and of Nueva Espana ; also that which grows ii the province of Soconusco is esteemed "even ii Europe. The breed of cattle of all kinds has inul tiplied infinitely. In the woods are found a gieU variety of animals, birds, and exquisite balsams plants ; and on the coasts of both seas are differen ports, which afford great facilities to commerci with the provinces of Peru, Nueva Espana, ant Tierra Firme, as also fine fishing. It has manj mines of various metals, which produce immens<   wealth, and particularly so those of silver. [According to Humboldt, the dollars imported into Guatemala and Nueva Esparia, in 1803, amounted to £2,000,000, and the exports consisted of produce to the value of 9,000,000 dollars, besides 22,50C\000 dollars in specie.

The receipts of Guatemala, Caracas, and Chile, are consumed within the country.] This kingdom is watered by several large rivers, some of which enter the N. sea, and others the S. It abounds in salt, which they have a peculiar mode of extracting by a process of boiling the earth which is washed up by the sea. This kingdom was conquered by Captain Pedro de Alvarado, native of Badajoz, in 1524, who was under the commission of the celebrated conqueror of Mexico, Hernan Cortes. The natives followed the same idolatrous rites as the Mexican Indians : they sacrificed men to their idols and eat them : they had pictures of the heroic actions of their nation for more than 800 years back. It was no easy task to reduce them to the catholic faith, through their extreme indolence, and the multitude of their idioms. The 13 aforesaid provinces are divided into 25 governments and alcaldias may ores; and these are, 
Nicaragua, Escuintla, 
Leon, Amatitanes,

==[[Guayal|GUAYAL]]==, a settlement of the province and government of Cartagena ; situate on the shore of the river Cauca, in the district of Mompox. 
==[[Guayana|GUAYANA]]==, [Gtjianne, Guiana, or Guinea], a large province of the government of Cumana, and part of Nueva Andalucia ; one of the largest in S. America. It comprehends all that country which is bounded e. and n. e. by the Atlantic ocean, n. and partly w. by the river Orinoco, w. by the kingdom of Grenada, and s. by the large chain of mountains which separates the waters running into the Orinoco and Atlantic ocean, from those running into the Amazonas. A great part of this vast province is unknown, from its not having been visited by others than the Catalanian Capuchin missionaries, and by these very triflingly ; consequently the information is very confused which we possess concerning the Caribes Indians ; knowing, however, that they are a warlike and wandering people. The territory is various, since in the boundaries of its vast extent are found large and inaccessible serranias and impenetrable mountains, in which are found all kinds of exquisite woods, and amidst and between them shady valleys, maintaining their verdure all the year round, and where every thing fructifies that is sown, no other labour of man being necessary than that of cutting wood for his fuel. Again, although in some parts rain is wanting, others supply such deficiency by their exceeding luxuriance and richness. The temperature is for the most part hot and moist ; for such is the luxuriance of the herbage  and vegetable world, clothing the fields, that they prevent the sun, however burning, completely to dry up the waters which flow from the innumerable rivers and streams ; and very great is the number of cattle thus supported. But it is not to be supposed that the heat is always excessive; on the contrary, the frequent winds blowing from the e. and which are called briza, render a pleasing coolness. In some parts the rain will descend in violent torrents, accompanied with tempests of thunder and lightning, almost daily; and in this province the days and nights are equal throughout the year, save by a few minutes. 
In what relates to the colonies which have been founded by foreigners in this Country, see the articles Surinam, Berbice, Esskquicbo, Cayenne, &c. Among the infinite number of its rivers the principal are, the Orinoco, Caroni, Paraguay, Caura, Ventuari, Usupania, Cayena, Oyapok, Marouini, Essequebo, Surinam, Saramacca, Brazo, Casiqnari, and others. The Indian nations most known, who live dispersed in the woods, are the Arvacas, the Caribes, viz. those of the mountains and of the plains, the Yaos, Aricuris, Aricaretes, Sebayos, Papinis, and Caribines. The most considerable islands are Casana, Maraca, Maiparo, Iracapono, Ovaracapa, and Cayenne. The first monks who entered upon the conversion of these Indians, were the Fathers Ignacio Llauri and Julian de Vergara, of the abolished order, in 1576 ; but they were, three years after, obliged to retire, through the invasion of Captain Hanson, a Dutchman. In 1687, the Capuchin fathers of the province of Cataiuna made an entry here, and had reason to be well pleased with the fruit of their labours, for they founded 28 settlements, which are, 
Caroni, Cumamo, 
Santa Maria, Topequen, 
Cupapuy, Aima, 
Palmar, Puedpa, 
San Antonio, Aguri, 
Altagracia, Santa Ana, 
San Joseph, Santa Rosa, 
Divina Pastora, Monte Calvario, 
Miamo, San Pedro, 
Carapo, Barinagotos, 
Morocuri, Upata, 
Guasipati, Maruanta, 
Caruasi, Parapana, 
Santa Barbara, San Juan Baptista; 
And those of Guirior and Barceloneta, of Spaniards. 
In the woods of this province are found the 9.   GUAYANA.  sano or vera, dividibi, caoba, guaracan, gateado, pomegranate, mulberry, Brazil, charaguaray, ceibas, habillas, cedars, sasaparilla, also honey, indigo, and wax : several kinds of reeds are also very common, and serve as ropes to bind together the beams of houses, &c. and these are so incorruptible, that, although exposed to the moisture of the earth, they remain for 60 years as strong as when they were first cut. Here is also a kind of pitch, which the Indians call caruata, and the Spaniards cocuha, which they mix in the manufacture of cords and ropes ; different kinds of palms, such as the royal palms, the caratas, corozos, moriches, ehaguaramas, the p alma de Sombrero or hatpalm, and many others; some of which are esteemed for their fruit, and others for their shoots, which, being boiled, make fine vegetables : also, of others are made hats of curious workmanship, used not only by the Indians and people of colour, but also by the Spaniards. The fruits are maya, quechue, chara, quamache, autumn and summer figs, paugi, cocopriz, mamon, cherries, jobos, and hicacos ; all of which are produced without cultivation : and besides these, sugarcanes, maize of five sorts, calabashes, melons, watermelons, potatoes, plantains of four kinds, medlars, mameyes, vegetables, anones, chirimoyas, papayas, guayabas, and plums. 
It also abounds in animals, as lions, tigers, cunaguaros, baquiras, chacharitas, potichis, bears, anteaters, meleros or honeyeaters, antas, wild boars, araguatos, eusicusis, rabopelados, mapuritos, acuris, squirrels, deer, foxes, and rabbits, armadillos, morrocois, pericos ligeros, (small lightfooted dogs) alligators, iguanas, chiguires, lapas, waterdogs, dormice, galapagos or snails, catuchis, manaties or seacows : and in the class of reptiles and insects, in various kinds of snakes, amongst which are the rattlesnake, the coral and macagua ; in monstrous centipeds, spiders, scorpions, salamanders, niguas, ticks, flies of various sorts, gusa* nos de monte, or mountainmaggots, which engender between the skin and the flesh, from the bite of one of the above flies, and which grow until they become covered with hair, causing the most intense, burning pain. It abounds also in a great variety of ants, which destroy the temples, houses, clothes, and garments ; of mice, and a multitude of other noxious reptiles, to such a degree that it should appear that the Creator had thought good to afflict this province with as many plagues as Egypt ; but in contradistinction to these, innumerable are the birds, which for exquisiteness of note or plumage render the groves delightful: the most worthy of remark are the parrots, of  which there are six species : besides which, there are the birds called guacamoyos, cardenales, sparrows, turpiales, paugies, ringdoves, guacharacas r uquiras or mountain turkeys, partridges, quails, mountain fowl, and many kinds of doves and ducks, which serve as an amusement to the Spaniards and Indians fond of the chase. 
The capital is of the same name, with the dedicatory title of Santo Tome ; founded by Antonio Berrio, in 1586, on the shore of the river Orinoco : of an hot and unhealthy temperature, but fertile in tobacco, cacao, and producing much cattle. The English, commanded by Walter Raleigh, sacked and destroyed it in 1617, and the Dutch, before the year 1579, instigated at the prohibition of a commerce of tobacco, which they used to carry on, presented themselves in a ship of war, under the pretence that they were merely about to recover some old debts ; and accordingly, having disembarked about nightfall, pillaged and burnt the city. It was, however, shortly rebuilt, and its situation removed to the spot where it now stands, 10 leagues below the river Caroni, at its narrowest part. At the mouths of this river, and in the islands situate there, is a part known by the name of Nueva Guayana, which has suffered the same misfortune as that we have just mentioned, having been attacked by a French privateer; but, in order to guard against a repetition of the same fate, a castle was built, called San Francisco, and another fort, with the name of San Diego del Padrasto ; and besides this, it was fortified by a contract entered into between the kingand the governor Don Martin de Mendoza y Berrio. 
The capital has a good parish church, and a convent of Franciscan monks, but a very small population, on account of its losses in the above invasions. Its principal commerce is in hides • and tobacco, which is much esteemed for its excellent quality. Sixty leagues from the city of San Joseph de Oruna, and ISO from the mouth of the Orinoco, in lat. 6° SO' n. Long. 63° 54' w. 

[INDEX TO ==[[Additional|ADDITIONAL]]==, INFORMATION "RE- SPECTING Guayana. 1. Portuguese, French, Dutch, and Spanish divisions. — 2. Importance of Guayana. — S. Extent and population. — 4. Political intercourse between the Dutch of Surinam and Spanish of Guayana, fyc. 1. Portuguese, French, Dutch, and Spanish divisions. — The coast of Guayana, from the mouth of the river Amazonas to that of the Orinoco, occupies an extent of 120 leagues, formerly possessed by four different powers. We shall here explain the divisions of each, previously to their]   —     216   Y A N A.  rooming exclusively into the hands of the English and Spanish. The Portuguese possessed the s. part. They spread, before the treaty with France, of Sept, 29, 1801, from the mouth of the river Arnazonas to cape North, and the e. of the island -of Carpori. By this treaty the boundaries of Portuguese and French Guayana were formed by the river Carapana, which discharges itself into the Arnazonas, at lat. 20' n. above fort Macapa. These boundaries follow the course of the river up to its source; from whence they take a direction towards the great chain of mountains which divide the courses of the waters, and are guided by the sinuosities of these mountains as far as the nearest point to Rio Blanco, between the 2d and 3d degrees of n. lat. 
Portuguese Guayana was therefore entirely on the left bank of the river Arnazonas ; bounded to the n. by the French possessions, as far as long. 55° from Paris. The line of separation between the Portuguese and Spaniards laid more to the w. The equator, according to the treaty, ought to have served as the boundary; but they so encroached on the Spanish territory, that their colonies extended 32 leagues n. of the line, namely, as far as the island of St. Joseph, and the mount De la Gloria del Cocui. The Spanish fort of San Carlos, at 1° 53' n. was intended to prevent all further usurpation, and to recover, if possible, the lost ground. 
French Guayana was bounded to the s. by the river Carapana, which flows into the river Arnazonas, to the n. by the river Maroni, to the e. by the sea, and to the w. by the Spanish possessions. 
Surinam, Essequebo, and Demerara, though now belonging to the English, (having been taken in the present war), were Dutch settlements, and were bounded to the e. by the sea, to the s. by the river Maroni, to the w. by the river Essequebo, according to the treaty, (though they have since made cape Nassau the n. boundary), and to the w. by Spanish Guayana. 
What remains of Guayana for the Spaniards is bounded on the e. by the sea, from cape Nassau to -the mouth of the Orinoco, which are 30 leagues distant from each other. The river Orinoco forms ■the s. boundary as far as 150 leagues from the sea, when it becomes the w. boundary ; because from this first point the river takes its course to the s. for a space of 100 leagues, where it receives the waters of the Guaviari : from this place the Orinoco having its course to the e. no longer serves as a boundary of Spanish Guayana, the other limits in these parts being formed by the Portuguese settlements.  
The conquest of the provinces cf Venezuela, Cumana, and of Maracaibo, occupied too much, during the first forty years, the few Spaniards to whom it whs confided, for them to think of carrying their arms further, whilst the ground they occupied was so warmly disputed, that their existence there was for a long time considered as precarious. 
The first European who attempted to enter the Orinoco was Lieut. -general John Cornejo. He ventured, in J 531, to penetrate by the mouths of the river, and surmounted many obstacles ; but at length his vessel was dashed to pieces on the breakers. The most of his attendants were saved, but these unhappy people escaped the waves to fall a prey to the Indians. 
2. Importance of Guayana. — It is difficult to find, throughout all the Spanish dominions, a settlement so favoured by nature and so little valued as Guayana. Its extent, which is estimated at 1000 leagues circumference, gives it the importance of an empire. The soil is so fertile that it would yield more produce than has been ever reaped from the whole of the other Spanish settlements. The rivers which are received into the Orinoco in its course of 500 leagues, and which exceed the number of 300, are so many canals, which would carry to Guayana the riches Avhich they themselves have contributed to obtain from the earth. The Orinoco, which crosses it, and which is the port by which an enemy can penetrate into Venezuela, Barinas, and Santa Fe, can be defended only by Guayana, which is consequently the bulwark of the provinces which she alone can guarantee. 
It might well be asked, why a country, which industry would prefer to all others, is a desert? — and why such advantages for a military position have not hitherto more engaged the attention of government ? 
To the first of these two questions it may be replied, that the Spanish population in America, possessing a hundred times as much ground as they can cultivate, has no inducement to wander in quest of more; and that the Spaniard, who is far from being possessed of the insatiable ambition that cannot be satisfied but by the sweat of the brow, but who, on the contrary, quickly attaches himself to the place, whether good or bad, where fate has placed him, cannot consent to abandon the spot where he has procured himself ease, and formed connections, to run after comfort which can be procured only by fatigue, the very idea of which is enough to terrify him. 
The second question can scarcely be answered]   Y A N A.  but by the considerable expence that the fortificaions and garrisons of Guayana would occasion, inless the government, relying on the difficulty lid danger ofthe navigation of the Orinoco, jinks that no nation would undertake the conquest f an uncultivated country, which is defended by s miseries better than could be done by arms. 
3. Extent and population. — Spanish Guayana, roin the mouth of the Orinoco to the Portuguese oundarics, occupies a space of more than four kindred leagues. Its breadth, in the first eighty jagues to thee, is not more than thirty leagues towards the s. where it is bounded by the Dutch set- [eiuenis, but afterwards the breadth increases to lore than 150 leagues. 
Over this immense surface there are but 34,000 ihabitnnts of every condition and colour, of which 9,425 are Indians under the conduct of missionries, 6575 are in the capital, and the remaining 000 are in the villages. The population is Slickest from the distance of 50 leagues from the 3a to 130 leagues up the Orinoco. 
Guayana is divided into High and Low Orinoco ; nd the capital is taken as the point of separation. lut this honour more justly belongs to the river Jaroni, because it bounds, in all the w. part, a aid which might properly be called an island ; jr it has the Orinoco to the n. the sea to the e. the iver Essequebo to the s. and the Caroni to the w. t forms almost a square, which is 70 leagues from . to w. and SO in its narrowest part from n. to s. Lmerica has not much land more fertile than this iclosure. 
The missionaries charged with bringing the Inians to a social life by means of Christianity, bean their work by this part of Guayana. T wen ty- ;ven villages built to the e. of the river Caroni bejeak the success of the Catalonian Capuchin falers. They have not, however, approached the oast by above SO leagues ; because it is inhabited y the Caribes, the most ferocious and courageous fall the Indians, who have invariably made mar- ,r rs of the apostles who have endeavoured to conertthem to Christianity. It is true that the feroity of the Caribes would have been softened by le morality of the missionaries, if the Dutch of urinam, wishing to extend their trade to Spanish luiana, had not made it a part of their politics to rotect the vagabond life of the Caribes, who presnt the Spaniards approaching their coast. It is ?rtain that Spanish Guayana appears upon the laps to occupy SO leagues of coast from the 1011th of the Orinoco to cape Nassaw, but might i reality be said not to occupy an inch ; for the dives have defended their independence so well 

VOL. II.  that they have never been converted, reduced, nor conquered ; and are, in fact, as free as they were before the discovery of America. It is lamentable that the barbarous use they make of their liberty obliges the philosopher to wish rather that they should lose than that they should preserve it. 
High Guayana. All that which is to the e. of the river Caroni, beginning a league above St. Thomas, is under the mission of the Franciscans. If we judge of their zeal by the result of their labours, we shall not have reason to be astonished ; but if we contrast what they have done with the difficulties they must have had to overcome, and of the decided repugnance of these Indians to receive the light of Christianity, we shall find it was hardly possible for human efforts lo accomplish more than these Franciscans have done oil the higher shores of the Orinoco. 
The most considerable ,of the Indian nations of Guayana are the Caribes, the Arvaques, the Yaos, and the Galibis. These are well proportioned, for the most part, are swarthy, and go naked. The Caribes are enterprising, and so cautious of surprise, that they post outguards and centinels with as much care and art as the Europeans. The Caribes of Guayana still fondly cherish tlje tradition of Sir Walter Raleigh's alliance ; and to this day preserve the English colours which he left with them at parting, above 200 years since. 
4. Political intercourse between the Dulchof Surinam and the Spanish of Guaj/ana, &c. — The Dutch,, have been thought to be much more vigilant and solicitous about the protection of their settlements in this quarter than the Spaniards. For the latter have no advanced posts on the frontiers of the former, whilst the Dutch have on the coast a body of guards, and occupy a fort called the Old Castle, at the junction of the river Mazurini with the Essequebo : they also keep an advanced guard of twentyfive men upon the river Cuyuni. By means of these precautions, they are not only respected on their own territory, but they overrun with safety all the neighbouring Spanish possessions. They remove their limits whenever their interest invites them, and maintain their usurpation by force. 
The natural result of this is, that the Spaniards and Dutch live at Guayana not like very good neighbours. They reproach each other with injuries, some of which are very serious. The Spaniards pretend that the Dutch constantly encioach upon their territory, and respect no limits; that they destroy the Spanish trade to Guayana, by the contraband goods they introduce ; that they continually excite the Caribes against them, and pre-]       218

[vent their subjection by the advice they give them, and the arms with which they furnish them. The Dutch, on their part, impute to the Spaniards the desertion of their slaves, who meet at Guayana with a hospitable reception, with their liberty and the protection of tbe government. It is true, that the Spaniards have for a long time protected, more from a principle of vengeance than of humanity, all the slaves of Surinam who have sought an asylum among them. They have even peopled with these fugitives two very considerable villages upon the banks of the river Caura, where they receive likewise the Indians who are forced by the Caribes to fly from the slavery of the Dutch. 
In one of the treaties between the Dutch and Spaniards, previously to the taking of Dutch Guayana by the English, it was stipulated on the part of the Spaniards to give up to the Dutch all the slaves who might have retired into the Spanish territory, or to pay their value ; and indeed, if this condition was always as faithfully fulfilled as it was latterly, it would reestablish between the two countries a harmony most decidedly in favour of the Spaniards; in as much as this is undoubtedly tbe weaker party.

GUA ==[[Yano|YANO]]==, a river of the province and government of Honduras. It runs n. and enters the sea opposite the island of Tortuga. 
==[[Guayapa|GUAYAPA]]==, San Andres de, a settlement of the head settlement of Cuilapa, and alcaldia mayor of Quatro Villas, in Nueva Espaiia. It contains 107 families of Indians, employed in the cultivation and commerce of cochineal, seeds, fruit, and charcoal, and in cutting wood. One league and an half e. n. e. of its head settlement. 
==[[Guayape|GUAYAPE]]==, a river of the province and government of Honduras, which runs n. and enters those of Guayano and Agnan. 
==[[Guayapegue|GUAYAPEGUE]]==, a large wood of palms, of 12 miles in length and 3\ wide, one mile from the shore of the river Atanari, being the spot where a bloody battle was fought in 1669 by the Guaibas and Chicoas against the Achaguas Indians, the latter being victorious. 
==[[Guayaquil|GUAYAQUIL]]==, a province and government of the kingdom of Quito. Its jurisdiction begins at cape Pasao to the n. in lat. 22' s. and extends s. as far as the settlement of Machala, or the banks of the Payama and mouth of the river of Tumbe, in lat. 3° 26' s. and bounded in that direction by the province of Truxillo, and juridiction of the corregimiento of Piura in Peru, e. by that of Cuenca, «. by that of Esmeraldas, and n. e. by those of Riobamba and Chimbo. It is composed of seven small provinces or districts, which are, La Punta, Daule Puna, Machala, Puerto Viejo, Babahoyo, Baba, and Yaguache ; in all of which there is a  lieutenantgovernor, heretofore nominated by the governors, for the consideration of 2000 dollars ; but this nomination was afterwards abrogated by the viceroy of Santa Fe. The extent of this pro-, vince is 110 miles from n. to s. from the mountain of the point of Santa Elena to the strands of the settlement of Ojiba; nearly as many wide, from the port of Manta to the settlement of Tumbes, although the Exjesuit Coleti makes it much less. It takes the name of its Cacique Guayys, who met his death by chance at the hands of one of the Spanish conquerors. It is of an extremely hot and moist temperature, of a low and plain territory, and subject to inundations during the winter. It is watered by several rivers, the four largest of which give their names to the districts of Daule, Baba, Babahoyo, and Yaguache, which flow down from the sierras of Quito, in the paramos and mountains of Tacunga, Guaranda, and Chimbo, and join in the plain, so as to form a navigable river, which straightway empties itself into the sea. In these rivers are abundance of fish of various kinds, such as robalos, corbinas, sabalo?, bagres, casones, skates, maids, ratones, barbudos, ciegos, eels, bios, bocachicos, biejas, mackerel, dicas, the swordfish, and large alligators, besides others peculiar to the sea into which they run. The territory produces much cacao, of which two crops are gathered annually, the best sort being that of Machala and of Troncoso ; a considerable number of neat cattle, mules, and horses ; also cotton, tobacco in leaf, dried fish, salt, wax, rice, ajonjoli, mam, honey, and cocos ; in all of which a great commerce is carried on with the other provinces of the kingdom, from which it takes in exchange cloths, baizes, carpets, cotton linens, called lucuyos, flour, and the necessaries of life, hams, cheese, sugar, and sweetmeats : also from Guatemala and Nicaragua it receives tobacco in dust, dye, indigo, pitch,tar, and simples ; from the provinces of Tierra Firme, European wares ana merchandise ; and from the ports of Peru f flour, sweetmeats, soap, tallow, sugar, and hides ; and this continual traffic causes it to be rich and abounding in everything that can conduce to the comfort or luxury of life^ Its woods abound with trees of the most superior quality, and by which its capital dock is supplied with the timber for building vessels ; the most esteemed sorts being the oak, guachapeli, saffron, cedar, balsam, laurel, cinafislolo, negro, mulberry, matasarna,jugano,figueroa, maria, seco, ebony, cascol, guayacan, Colorado, guayado de monte, zeibo, mamatapalo, mangle, the large figtree, gitarango, medlar, cinnamon, carotu, pinuela, and buckthorn. But in the midst of all these advantages it f F 2  G U A    does not want the plague of insects, and animals of a noxious kind ; for from the stagnation of the pools, and by the intolerable heats, are bred a host of venomous insects, mosquitoes, toads, mice, scorpions, vipers, and snakes ; namely, the boba, mapanae, coral, rattle, and bejuco ; and these would be in greater abundance but that the bird of prey, the curiqtiingui, is constantly looking out for them to devour them. The number of alligators found in the rivers, and which frequently go a great way on the land to bask themselves in the sun, is incredible; some of these creatures have been found to measure seven yards. The Indians make a diversion of taking them ; for they wait for them armed with a weapon, which is a piece of very hard wood of about half a j^ard long, finely pointed at both ends, and which they call tolele; moreover, to it is attached in its centre a leather thong; and this they succeed in thrusting into the animal's mouth when open to devour them, so that" they completely gag it, leaving the jaws fully distended, when this monster becomes perfectly harmless, and serves the children as an amusement. The population consists of only 10 settlements, and of these there were four of the doctrinal establishments of the religious order of St. Domingo, before that their curacies had been removed. The capital is the city of Guayaquil, Santiago, of the samename, founded in 1533, in the bay of Charapoto, by Don Francisco Pizarro. ft is the second town of Peru, as according to a schedule of the Emperor Charles V. which the city still preserves. It was entirely destroyed by the Indians, and rebuilt by Francisco de Orellana, in 1537, on the w. shore of the river of its name, from whence it was removed to the place called Ciudad Vieja, and lastly, in 1693, to where it now slands. From the great increase of its population, it has been divided into two distinct wards, the which are separated by a wooden bridge of 800 yards long, erected against the inundations of the salt water lakes, which are frequent on account of the lowness of the territory. The city is If mile long, of a beautiful plant, and good houses ; these however being of wood, render it liable to conflagration. It has three convents, . namely, of the religious orders of San Francisco, San Domingo, and San Agustin, a college which belonged to the Jesuits, and an hospital of S. Juan de Dios, two small forts with very little defence, a celebrated and commercial port in the river, and a capital dock to the s', on the. shore of the same river. Here have been built an infinite number of ships of the line, owing to the excellent quality and incorruptibility of the wood, and which is cut at no greater a distance than 200 paces. With all these advantages the city was nearly abandoned until the year 1770, when the king ordered it to be reestablished, and the construction to be cuitinued. In it reside the governor, dependent on the president of Quito, a cabildo composed of two ordinary alcaldes and 12 regidors, with the other necessary officers, namely, two royal oficiales, who with the accountant and treasurer have the charge of the king's duties. Here is a battalion of militia of six companies, whose services are pointed out by the viceroy. Its population in both towns, new and old, amounts to 22,000 souls, amongst whom are many illustrious families, such as those of Calvo, Aguirre, Mispireta, Aviles, Casaus, Arellano, Betancur, Coello, Plazaert, and others. The temperature is very warm and moist, the streets dirty, and swarming with venomous and troublesome insects. The natives are spirited, cheerful, courteous, liberal, and hospitable. It is filled with all kinds of productions, as well European as American, and wants none of the necessaries of life. It has a wellprovided repository of arms, and a good customhouse, and once one of the richest cities in Peru ; but it has suffered much from the misfortune of 10 several conflagrations, and in 1692, 1707, and 1764, it was almost burnt to ashes. It has also been thrice invaded by enemies ; the first time by Jacob Heremite Clerk, in 1624 ; the second by Edward David, in 1687 ; and the third by William Dampierre, in 1707. [At an average of four years, from 1799 to 1803, the quantify of cacao exported hence amounted to 600,000 frmegas.l It has been the native place of the Father Lucas Maxano, of the abolished order of the Jesuits, an apostolic missionary of singular eminence in the province of Mainas ; of Father Lucas Ximenez, who was employed the same way; and of Don Pedro Franco Diivila, once director of the royal cabinet of natural history in this court. It is 238 leagues from Callao, 220 from Panama, 98 from Quito, and 40 from Paita, in lat. 2° 11' 21" s. Long. 79° 40' w. 
Guayaquil, a river of this province and government, formed of various others, flowing from the cordillcra of the Andes, and especially from the mountains of San Antonio. It washes the city, and is nearly a league wide; is navigable for 28 leagues, as far as Caracol, and opposite the same place it divides itself into two arms, forming an island. It ebbs and flows with the seatides ; its shores are covered with mangles, which form thick groves, called manglares. The sandbanks which are in it, and which shift their situation by the impetus of the current, render its navigation very   difficult for large vessels^ and these are steered by an experienced pilot, after having left their guns in the island of La Puna: This river abounds in alligators, which are ordinarily found in the large lakes or swamps left by the river; and it enters the sea in the jrulf of its name, in lat. 2° 27' s.

[GULF of Florida, or New Bahama Channel, is bounded on the w. by the peninsula of E. Florida, and on the e. by the Bahama islands. It is generally about 40 miles wide, and extends from the 25th to the 28th deg. of n. latitude.] 
[Gulf Stream. This remarkable phenomenon is a current in the ocean, which runs along the coast, at unequal distances from enpe F o ida to the isle of Sables and the banks of Newfoundland, where it turns off, andrunsdown through the Western islands ; thence to the coast of Africa, and g ©  
•"mma^^mtmmFn  
'  GUN   along that coast in a s. direction till it arrives at, and supplies the place of, those waters carried by the constant tradewinds from the coast of Africa towards the w. ; thus producing a constant circulatinocurrent. This stream is about 75 miles from the shores of the s. states, and the distance increases as you proceed n. The width of it is about 40 or 50 miles widening towards the n. Its common rapidity 'is three miles an hour. A n. e. wind narrows the stream, renders it more rapid, and drives it nearer the coast : n. w. and w. winds have a contrary effect. The Gulf stream is supposed to be occasioned by the tradewinds, that are constantly driving the water to the w. which being compressed in the gulf of Mexico, finds a passage between Florida and the Bahama islands, and runs to the n. e. along the American coast. This hypothesis is confirmed by another fact. It is said that the water in the gulf of Mexico is many yards higher than on the w. side of the continent in the Pacific ocean. It is highly probable that the sand carried down by great rivers into bays, and the current out of these bays meeting with the Gulf stream by their eddies, have formed Nantucket shoals,' cape Cod, George's bank, the island of 
Sable, &c. . 
Skilful navigators, who have acquired a knowledge of the extent to which this stream reaches on the New England coast, have learnt in their voyages from Europe to New England, New York or Pennsylvania, to pass the banks of Newfoundland in about lat. 44° or 45° n. to sail thence in a course between the n. edge of the Gulf stream, and the shoals and banks of Sable island, George s bank, and Nantucket, by which they make better and quicker voyages to America.] _

[Hamilton, a town or settlement lately laid out in Albany county, New York, in the extensive township of Water Vliet, formerly called the Glass Factory ; and has its present name in honour of that great patron of American manufactures, the late secretary of the treasury of the United States of America. It lies 10 miles w. of Albany, two miles from the Schenectady road ; and is one of the most decisive efforts of private enterprise in the manufacturing line, as yet exhibited in the United States. The glass manufactory is now so well established, and so happily situated for the supply of the n. and w. parts of the states of New York, as well as Vermont and Canada, that it is to be expected the proprietors will be amply rewarded for their great and expensive exertions. The glass is in good reputation. Here are two glasshouses, and various other buildings, curious hydraulic works to save manual labour by the help of machinery. A copious stream runs through the heart of the settlement, which lies high ; and being surrounded by pine plains, the air is highly salubrious. The Great Schoharie road traverses the settlement. A spacious schoolhouse, and a church of an octagon form, are soon to be erected. 
The enterprising proprietors of the glass and other works in this thriving settlement, were incorporated by the legislature of New York in the spring of 1797, by the name of " The Hamilton Manufacturing Society," which act has given a spring to the works here, and authorises a hope that American manufactures may not only be conducive to the interests of the country, but also to that of the proprietors. 
In the neighbourhood of these glass works, a block was cut out of an ancient tree, not many years ago, containing evident marks of an axe or some edge tool, made 185 years ago, determined according to the usual and certain mode of ascertaining the age of trees. The block is preserved in Albany as a curiosity. Henry Hudson ascended the river which bears his name, as high as Albany, in the autumn of 1609, 187 years ago, and these narks were probably made by some of his men.]

The author from whom we have extracted these accounts of the English colonies makes this province much reduced, and to consist only of eight settlements.

[HANCOCK'S Harbour, called by the Indians Clioquot, is situated about 20 leagues e. s. e. of Nootka, in lat. 48° 30' n. Long. 125° 26' w. from Greenwich. The entrance of this harbour is about five miles in length, and has good anchorage ; about it are scattered a number of islands, and several sandbanks or shoals. It has also a number of fine coves. The land round the harbour is generally uneven, rocky, and mountainous; covered, however, with pine, fir, spruce, cedar,  hemlock, cypress, and other trees of a remarkable size. The climate here is much milder than in the same latitude on the e. side of the continent ; the frost in winter being seldom so severe as to prevent vegetation. An e. wind is considered here as a prognostic of a storm, and w. winds bring fair weather. Deer, racoons, wolves, bears, squirrels, martins, land otters, beaver, and wild cats, are the animals which inhabit the forests. The amphibious animals are the common seal and the sea otter. The skin of the latter is very valuable. The inhabitants are said to be cannibals.

[Hancock, a river of Washington island, on the n. w. coast of N. America, called Masheet by the Indians, discovered by Captain Crowell in 1791.

It has at its mouth five fathoms water, gradually increasing in breadth ; and for 7£ miles to Goose island, has not less than 10 fathoms. Captain Ingraham examined it about 12 miles ; but by the information of the natives, he judged that it communicates with Skittikiss bay, or near it, on the e. side of the islands. It is by far the most eligible for a new settlement of any place the captain had seen on the coast. The land is low, and apparently very fertile ; and the river abounds with salmon. Were a good house erected on some of the pleasant spots, it would have every appearance of being long settled. Beautiful bushes and grass occupy the skirts of the woods.

North of the ferry to Amherst, the river meets with a bed of rocks, which lessens its breadth 20 or 30 rods ; no fall, but a lar^e eddy at high water.] [H ATT ERAS is the most remarkable and dangerous cape on the coast of N. America. This point extends far into the ocean, from the coast of N.Carolina, in lat. 35°9'«. and long. 75° 54' w. The water is very shallow at a great distance from the cape, which is remarkable for sudden squalls of wind, and for the most severe storms of thunder, lightning, and rain, which happen almost every day, during one half the year. At the time of Sir Walter Raleigh's approaching this coast, the shoals in the vicinity of Hatteras were found so dangerous, so extensive, and so shallow, many of them covered with not more than five or six feet water, that no vessels in that latitude*, ventured within seven leagues of the land. •? 
At present the outshoals, which lie about 14 miles s.zo. of the cape, are but of five or six acres extent; and where they are really dangerous to vessels of moderate draught, not above half that extent. On the shoalest part of these is about 10 feet at low water ; and here, at times, the ocean breaks in a tremendous manner, spouting, as it were, to the clouds, from the violent agitation of the Gulf stream, which touches the e. edge of the banks, from which the declivity is sudden, that is to say, from 10 fathoms to no soundings. On the spot abovementioned, which is firm sand, it has been the lot. of many a good vessel to strike, in a gale of wind, and go to pieces. In moderate weather, however, these shoals may be passed over, if necessary, at full tide, without much danger, by vessels not drawing more than eight, nine, or 10 feet water. From this bank, formerly of vast extent, and called the Full Moon shoal, a ridge runs the whole distance to the cape, about a n. w. course; is about half a mile wide, and at low water has generally 10, Jl, and 12 feet water. There are gaps at equal intervals, affording channels of about 15 or 16 feet water. The most noted of these is about a mile and a half from the land, and is at least two miles and a half wide, and might at full sea be safely passed by the largest ships ; but is rarely used except by coasting vessels. It may be easily known by a range of breakers always seen on the w. side, and a breaker head or two on the    
23 r  e. side ; which, however, are not so constant, ordy appearing when the sea is considerably agitated. A little n. of the cape is good anchoring in four or five fathoms, and with the wind to the w. a boat may land in safety, and even bring off casks of fresh water, plenty of which is to be found every where on tiie beach, by digging a foot or two, and putting a barrel into the sand.]

==[[Havana|HAVANA]]==, a city of the island of Cuba, one of the largest of the Antilles, founded by Diego Velazquez, who conquered the island in 1511. It was at first but small, and was called Puerto de Carenas ; it afterwards changed its situation, and by its increase and riches became one of the most considerable cities of America, taking the name of San Christoval de la Havana. In 1536, it was sacked by a French pirate, and was then so small as to ransom itself from being burnt, for the trifling sum of 700 dollars. A short time afterwards it was taken by the English, and again by the French, but neither was its importance yet known in Spain, nor was there as yet sufficient care taken to fortify it until the reign of Philip II. and indeed, in 1666, it was in no state of defence. This city is situate on the w. side of the port, in a pleasant and delightful plain, which is washed in front by the sea, and on its other sides by the river Lagida. The buildings are handsome but not lofty ; they are built of stone, are of good construction, and prettily ornamented : the churches are rich and magnificent. Here are convents of the religious orders of St. Francis, St. Augustin ; an hospital of San Juan de Dios, of La Merced, of St. Domingo, in which is founded an university, and the monasteries of the nuns of Santa Clara and Santa Catalina. Although the capital of the island is Cuba, yet this is the residence of the governor, captaingeneral, as well as of the bishop, whose cathedral is also here. The port is not only the best in all America, but in all the world : it is capable of containing 1000 ships at anchor, in perfect security 5 its entrance is through a channel of about half a mile long and very narrow, and     238    very difficult for an enemy to enter, from its being ■well defended : at the end of the port is another small bay, having a small island in its e. part. At the entrance of the channel are various castles well furnished with artillery, the principal of which is that called El Mono, formerly known by the name of Los Tres Reyes, and built by the celebrated engineer Juan Baptista Autoneli, in 1584 : this is on the e. side of the entrance, and has a battery or low platform, on a level with the water, containing 12 cannons, some of which are 36 pounders, called the Twelve Apostles. On the side of the city, and opposite the aforesaid castle, is the fort of San Salvador de la Punta, built at the same time as the former ; and within the town, at the extremity of the channel which looks to the port, is the castle of La Fuerza, the residence of the governor, the same being the work of the Alcayde Mateo de Aceytuno, in 1544. Besides these there are the forts of Coximan and Chorrera, to defend the Plaza, which were built in 1646 ; also the walls and bastions of La Plaza, built in 1633 ; and lastly, in 1763, two large castles, called San Carlos and Santo Domingo de Atares, which were begun by the governor Count de Ricla, in the spot called La Cabana, at the back of the mountain of this name, and commanding the Plaza. What adds still further to the excellence of this port is its capital dock, where ships are constantly built for the royal armada, as are also merchantvessels, and of the very best sorts of wood; having for this business a marine department, the commandant of which is a general officer, who commands the squadrons commonly known here by the name of Armada de Barlovento, the same being for the security of these coasts, and for the purpose of transporting the allowances from Vera Cruz to this and the other islands. The commerce of this port, which is the most considerable of America, is to be divided generally into that which is done by the island of Cuba, and of which we have treated in this article, and into that which is peculiar to it ; for it is the general resort of all the vessels from the ports of Tierra Firme and N'ueva Espana, the same being accustomed to touch here in their way to Europe. Indeed it seldom happens that there are less than 40 or 50 vessels lying here at a time ; and during their stay, here is, as it were, a continual fair, which was still greater when the fleets used to sail to Nueva Espana and Tierra Firme ; the which used to join company in order to proceed on their voyage in the month of September, this being the most favourable season in which to make the mouth of the canal of Bahama. The city may be about two   miles in circumference, and is of an hot temperature, but abounds in every thing necessary for the convenience of life. It is inhabited by many rich and noble families, and in its customs, policy, traffic, and establishments, it may vie with the best cities in Europe. It suffered much in 1762, by a siege made against it by the English, who attacked it with a strong squadron under the command of Admiral Pocock, and a numerous army headed by the Duke of Albermarle ; but it at last capitulated after a glorious defence made by the Spaniards, under the command of the governor and brigadier Don Juan de Prado, assisted by the lieutenantgeneral Don Joseph Manso, Count of Superunda, who had been viceroy of Peru, and the brigadier Don Diego Tabares, governor of Cartagena, all of whom happened to be here on their way to Spain ; and thus, by this event, did the enemies find themselves masters of the town, in which there were great riches, not to mention a squadron of 12 ships of war. It was, however, afterwards restored to the Spaniards in the peace of Versailles. In 1703, there was lost upon the castle of La Punta, the fine ship of war called El Bueno, of the French squadron of Mr. Ducase; in 1721, the S. Juan, commanded by the captain Don Francisco Maldonado; and in J740, the ship Invincible, of the squadron of Don Rodrigo de Torres, afterwards Marquis of Matalana : this latter vessel having come within the bay, and blowing up from having been stricken with lightning, when also great mischief was done to the city. Its population amounts to about 26,000 souls. It is in lat. 23° 8' 30" n. Long. 82° 16' 30" w.

In it is a bed of iron ore, which has yielded some profit to the proprietor, also a quarry of freestone, fit for hearths and chimneypieces.

Haverhill has a considerable inland trade, lying about 27 miles n. of Boston, and 12 miles from Newburyport, at the mouth of the river, and about 24 s.w. of Portsmouth in New Hampshire. It lies chiefly upon two streets, the principal of which runs parallel with the river. Vessels of 100 tons burthen can go up to it. Travellers are struck with the pleasantness of the situation ; and a number of neat and well finished houses give it an air of elegance. Here are two churches, one for Congregationalists, and one for Baptists, three distilleries, one of which has lately undergone a laudable transmutation into a brewery. Some vessels are annually built here, and several are employed in the West India trade. A manufactory of sailcloth was beoun here in 1789, and is said to be in a promising way.

HIDE. The district and jurisdiction of the province and colony of N. Carolina. r==[[Hietans|HIETANS|Com a nches]]==, Indians of N. Ame-   rica, called by both these names ; have no fixec place of residence ; have neither towns nor villages and are divided into so ninny different hordes oi tribes, that they have scarcely any knowledge o one another. No estimate of their numbers car well be made. They never remain in the same place more than a few days, but follow the buffalo the flesh of which is their principal food. Some o them occasionally purchase of the Panis corn beans, and pumpkins ; but they are so numerous any quantity of these articles the Panis are able t< supply them with, must make but a small propor tion of their food. They have tents made of neatlj dressed skins, fashioned in the form of a cone sufficiently roomy for a family of ten or twelv< persons; those of the chiefs will contain occasion' ally 50 or 60 persons. When they stop, theii tents are pitched in very exact order, so as to foru regular streets and squares, which in a few minute! have the appearance of a town, raised, as it were by enchantment ; and they are equally dexterou! iri striking their tents and preparing for a march, when the signal is given. To every tent two horses or mules are allotted, one to carry the tent, and another the poles or sticks, which are neatly made of red cedar; they all travel on horseback. Tlieii horses they never turn loose to graze, but always keep them tied with a long cabras or halter ; and every two or three days they are obliged to move, on account of all the grass near them being eaten up, they have such numbers of horses. Thej are good horsemen and have good horses, most ol which are bred by themselves ; and being accus« tomed when very young to be handled, they art remarkably docile and gentle. They sometimes catch wild horses, which are every where amongst them in immense droves. They hunt down the buffalo on horseback, and kill them either with the bow, or a sharp stick like a spear, which thej carry in their hands. They are generally at wai with the Spaniards, often committing depredations upon the inhabitants of Santa Fe and St. Antoine; but have always been friendly and civil to any French or Americans who have been among them. They are strong and athletic, and the elderly men as fat as though they had lived upon American beef and porter. It is said, the man who kills a buffalo, catches the blood and drinks it while warm ; they likewise eat the liver raw, before it is cold, and use the gall by way of sauce. They are, for savages, uncommonly clean in their persons. The dress ol the women is a long robe, that reaches from theii chin to the ground, tied round with a fancy sash or girdle, all made of neatly dressed leather, on]  fwliich they paint figures of different colours and significations : the dress of the men consists of close feather pantaloons, and a hunting shirt, or frock of the same. They never remain long enough in the same place to plant any thing. The small Cayenne nepper grows spontaneously in the country ; with which, and some wild herbs and fruits, particularly a bean that grows in great plenty on a small tree resembling a" willow, called muskcto, the women cook the buffalo beef in a manner that would be orateful to an American squire. They alternately occupy the immense space of country from the Trinity and Braces, crossing the Red river, to the heads of Arkansa and Missouri, to the river Grand, and beyond it, about Santa Fe, and over the dividing ridge on the waters of the w. ocean, where they say they have seen large peroques, with masts to litem; in describing which, they make a drawing of a ship, with all its sails and rigging : and they describe a place where they have seen vessels ascending a river, over which was a drawbridge that opened to give them a passage. Their native language of sounds differs from the language of any other nation, and none can either speak or understand it ■; but they have a language by signs, that all Indians understand, and by which they converse much among themselves. They have a number of Spanish men and women among them, who are slaves, which they made prisoners when young. 
About 20 years since, a party of these Indians passed over the Grand river to Chewawa, the residence of the governorgeneral of what is called the Five Internal Provinces ; lay in ambush for an opportunity, and made prisoner the governor's daughter, a young lady, going in her coach to mass, and brought her off. The governor sent 1000 dollars for the purpose of recovering his daughter, and dispatched a confidential trader, with the amount of the 1000 dollars in merchandise, who repaired to the nation, found her, and purchased her ransom : but to his great surprise, she refused to return with him to her father, and sent by him the following message : That the Indians had disfigured her face by tattooing it, according to their fancy and ideas of beauty, and a young man of them had taken her for his wife, by whom she believed herself pregnant ; that she had become reconciled to their mode of life, and was well treated by her husband ; and that she should be more unhappy by returning to her father, under these circumstances, than by remaining where she was. Which message was conveyed to her father, who rewarded the trader by a present of 300 dollars more for his trouble and fidelity. His daughter is    now living with her Indian husband in the nation, by whom she has three children.]

It was at first a small settlement, established for the convenience of lading and unlading vessels, being the port for all the commerce of the Nuevo Reyno and the province of Quito. It is to this that it owes its present flourishing state ; and it is in fact one of the best ports in the kingdom, having had the title of town conferred upon it by the king, in 1643. It is of a hot temperature, but healthy, although infested with musquitoes. It is very rich and fertile in cacao, sugarcane, tobacco, maize, and the other fruits of a warm climate. It has some very good buildings, and, besides the parish church, a convent of the religious order of San Francisco, another of Santo Domingo, a house of entertainment of the barefooted monks of San Agustin ; and without the town, a college which belonged to the regulars of the extmgushed company of Jesuits, an house of entertainment, and an hermitage. It was for a long time a curacy of the Jesuits. It is the residence of a judge of the ports, who is entrusted with the care of the lading and unlading effects at the royal storehouses. Its inhabitants, who amount to 10,000, have the credit of being very faithful to their commercial engagements, but at the same time very haughty.

==[[Honduras|HONDURAS|Hibueras]]==, a province and government of the kingdom of Guatemala. It extends from e. to w. the length of the coast of the N. sea, for 185 leagues, being 50 in width n. s. It is bounded the whole length of its extent by the provinces of Guatemala, San Salvador, San Mi-   HON guel, Choluteca, and Nicaragua; on the $. rs>, by the province of ^eraPaz, and n. n. e. and n. w. by the oulf of its name ; and this it had from the circumstance of the Spaniards, after great distress, not being able to find a port for a great distance along the coast, having thanked God at their delivery from so many honduras or depths. It is also called Hibueras, through the abundance of the calabashes of an extraordinary size found here, and which are thus called in St. Domingo. This country is for the most part mountainous, although it is not without valleys and llanuras. It is of a hot and moist temperature, and consequently unhealthy. It produces much cotton, of which are made quilts much and universally esteemed, the same forming one of the principal branches of its commerce. It abounds no less in honey, which is made by the bees in cells under ground, in wax, aji or pepper, Spanish potatoes, maize, and French beans ; and from these three crops are gathered annually, since the country is rendered extremely fruitful by the inundations of the rivers, which ordinarily begin from the feast of Si. Michael the archangel ; and at this time the natives make canals and aqueducts for irrigating their orchards and gardens. This benefit is produced by various large rivers, the largest of which is the Hangaro. They all abound with fish ; and these -are caught by the course of the river being blocked up by trees and earth, and the men and women then going into the water and killing them, by means of sticks and javelins. The vines yield fruit twice a year, for the first vintage is scarcely over before the second crop of fruit is set ; and this is gathered before Christmas. Notwithstanding this great fertility of the country, much distress and scarcity was felt by the inhabitants previous to the coming of the Spaniards ; for, being naturally idle, they cultivated so few things, that they were under the necessity of supporting themselves b}' roots and even insects. They were much given to drunkenness, and were extremely fond of a liquor which they used to make from the honey of bees : at the same time they committed the most outrageous cruelties, reforming however their conduct as soon as they were reduced to the Catholic faith. The town was formerly very large, though now much reduced. This country was conquered by Christoval de Olid Estremefio, one of the captains of Hernan Cortes, and renowned in the conquest of Mexico. Finding that he was sent hence, he denied obedience to his master Cortes, who with the intent to punish him followed him in a long and tedious pursuit, and when he came up with him found that he had been treacherously killed by his soldiers,   as a reward for excesses he had committed, capital is Valladolid, or Comayagua. Honduras, a very large and convenient bay of the above province, between the cape Honduras, in lat. 15-fn. and that of Coteche, at the e. extremity of the province of Yucatan, in 21|°. This bay is celebrated for the establishment which the English made here, for cutting dyeing wood, and has been on various occasions the subject of many\ differences between the courts of Madrid and London. The part fixed upon for this establishment is, according to Mr. Uringe, a great plain, the greater part of the same being swampy and full of lakes. In the dry season, when the woodcutters have a certain quantity of trees cut, they build a kind of cabin for their residence; they take off the bark from the trees, heap them together and when the rains come and deluge the country, let themselves be carried along with them down to the place where they are laden, where they are sold at 5/. the ton, Jamaica currency. At first the English carried on this trade in the bay of Campeche, but being driven from thence by the Spaniards, they transferred it to that of Honduras, where they have maintained themselves by force of arms, increasing until their numbers amounted to 1500, including masters and public officers. At the peculiar season the woodcutters go in search of these trees, which grow in a line for many miles : they then cut the branches into large pieces, which they leave upon the ground until the rains bear them down to the river : from thence they are transported in canoes to the great public storehouses and lading places. The youth who dedicate themselves to this employ receive at first wages equal to a ton of Campeche wood for each month, with the liberty of working one day in each week on their own account. If they are sober and conduct themselves well, they are allowed after a certain time to Join their stock with that of their masters, and thus to carry on a free commerce. These labourers have a king, who governs them by laws which he enacts ; also the vessels which come into the bay are under his custody. The wood is brought hither in flatbottomed boats and during the night, in order that the day may be spared for putting it aboard. When the sailors of Jamaica find themselves persecuted, either by fancied or real ills, they embark for the bay of Honduras, where they follow the aforesaid employment. The whole of their equipment generally consists in a certain quantity of hatchets, chisels, saws, large knives, a grindstone, a musket, some powder and ball, and small shot; all the which they enclose in a chest, or roll up in a bit k K 2   -i  HON  of canvas, tied round by a cord. Their business is to cut the wood as near as possible to the sea, and the Tartans of New England who go to Jamaica, if they do not find a cargo there, come to seek one at this bay. The woodcutters often make heaps of wood before the season for embarkation, and in that case they are never touched or violated by others. This traffic was at one time a nest of pirates, and at another of a. set no better than robbers : indeed, all the malefactors of Jamaica, Martinique, Curazao, and the other islands, were sure of finding at this bay men of a bold, enterprising spirit, ready and fit for deeds of hardship, who were moreover well armed and excellent mariners. In 1722, this commerce was interrupted by five Spanish frigates, the which took and burnt 12 vessels, destroyed the establishments that were made here, as also all the wood that was cut, and put to death the colonists ; but after some years, a fresh establishment had formed itself, which at last obtained the royal permission from the crown of Spain to maintain itself under certain limits and conditions. Some of the above trees of the dyeing wood grow high and straight, but they afterwards become crooked ; they have a small leaf, their branches low and full of sharp points, and their fruit is similar to white plums. They flower and bear a seed, which, falling on the earth, springs up and is rendered luxuriant by the inundations. All the rivers which run into the sea at this bay, abound in alligators and fish ; and in the woods is a great variety of birds and quadrupeds, such as stags, which are weak and small, tigers, and monkeys. In the small islands of the bay are found many small tortoises, or, as they are called there, galapagos, which are sought for with great eagerness. Here are also quantities of manaties, there called Jews fish, the same being very bulky and somewhat resembling a cod, although larger and better tasted ; they have moreover strong scales, and are accustomed to weigh 80 pounds each.

At the distance of two leagues is a chapel, in which is venerated a cross, in regard to which the following wonderful miracle has happened: When the pirate Francis Drake arrived here in an English vessel, and was disappointed at not finding any thing to relieve his hunger and necessities, he, with his companions, under the impulse of rage, resolved to revenge themselves by venting their fury against the cross which was standing fixed here, and accordingly, having taken the trouble to besmear it with pitch, they set fire to it ; but the pitch burnt off, and the wood, remained uninjured. More indignant still at this, they attached one end of a cable to the holy wood, and the other to the ship's mast, so that it might pull whilst the ship was in sail ; and notwithstanding the violence of the shock, the cross was not the least disturbed from its situation, but the cable snapped in twain. After some time these same sailors returned ashore, and began with hatchets and other instruments to hew down this wonderful tree ; but the miracle did not stop here, for their heaviest blows could make no impression whatever, whilst their implements broke to pieces: In testimony therefore of this event, the chapel was built on the very spot, where also the cross is to be seen at this day.

America, where the English company of its name have various establishments and forts, and where, through the medium of their factors, they carry on a great trade with the Indians, taking from these castorskins and other articles, on which they make a very great profit. This bay is about 860 miles long from Moose fort on the s. to Cumberland island on the n. : its width is unequal, since in some parts it is 590 miles, and in others as narrow as 130. At its entrance are ;he islands of    Resolution and Mansfield, and in (be strait those of Charles, Salisbury, and Nottingham. From Resolution island to cape Diggs, at the entrance of the bay, it is about 388 miles. The lands on either side, Avhich are those of Labrador and North Main, are in general very high, sometimes precipitous; and in some places are found large breaches, which are inhabited by savages, of whom little is known. The e. part of the bay, which is in lat. 57° n. is called Bottom bay, and the most e. part James bay. The coast of the cape Harriot or Henrietta Maria is in lat. 55° 15' n. From the beginning of James bay to the bottom of the bay it is near 267 miles, and the average width of the whole is from 40 to 50 leagues. On the e. part or coast of Labrador, are situate the small islands called the Sleeping, Northern and Western isles, Baker's Dozen, and Belcher ; and in James bay those of Bear, Vinner, Charlton, and Cape of Good Hope. The whole of the country that lies between the s. and e. as far as the land of Labrador, is called New South Wales. This country was discovered by an Englishman named Hudson, who gave it his name; he was in search for a pass to China in three different voyages made in 1607, 1608, and 1610, when he arrived at 80° 23' lat. combating with the greatest difficulties against snow and ice, which detained him until the spring of the following year, 1611. A great part of his crew becoming mutinous, deserted him, and committing themselves to the mercy of the seas in the open boat, were all supposed to have perished, having never since been heard of. The French pretend that this country had been previously discovered by themselves, and that they had already formed establishments in it ; but on this point we do not find them adducing any proofs. 
The climate, although under the torrid zone, is incredibly cold and severe, and people are obliged to live with the greatest precaution lest they should be frozen ; and thus they make to themselves small caverns, in which they have large fires, and no other hole than such as may be sufficient to keep the same alive. Notwithstanding this, the cold is so powerful that the bedclothes are frozen in the morning, and stick to the walls that they touch, and the breath of a person sleeping freezes. Any thing that is away from the fire is sure to freeze, and no liquor, not even brandy or spirits of wine, escape the allsubduing power. If you touch a piece of steel, iron, or other solid body, your hands become rivetted to the same ; and in the act of drinking, the skin of the lips or tongue becomes so glued to the side of the cup as to be sometimes  
.  HUD  stripped off when the cup is withdrawn. Elliz, who made a voyage to this country, relates, that havingordered a man to put his finger to the hole of a cask of beer for fear it should run out and waste, the poor fellow, in endeavouring to get his finger away, lost a part of it behind. The effect of this extraordinary cold manifests itself on all the animal kingdom, for there is not a creature but which, on the approach of the severe season, puts on a wintry and snowcoloured garb; and notwithstanding those who inhabit these parts take the utmost precaution to defend themselves against being frozen to death, yet the cold is often found to surprise them, attacking first the extremities. Nay, the aforesaid author further asserts, that the -qompass itself has been known to lose its magnetic powers. With all this the country is healthy, and the people live to a great age. 
The natives are as barbarous as their neighbours; they acknowledge a God as being supreme and of infinite goodness, and they call him Ukkeuma, which in their language signifies great head. To him they look as the author of all the good they enjoy, and they speak of him with great respect, singing hymns with great solemnity and pomp, though considerable harmony ; their ideas are, however, vague, confused, and hard to determine with respect to their religion and public worship. They have another being, whom they call Witikka, whom they represent as the origiu of all ills, and of whom they stand in the greatest awe : but it is not known that they make any sacrifice to him to ensure his favour. They have so remarkable a fondness for their children, that they willingly, both father and mother, will vie in sacrificing their lives to their safely. The dogs here are nearly similar to the mastiffs of Europe : they never bark, but only growl when they are angry : these are the only animals of burthen used by the English and the Indians, and they will carry a great weight. 
The great expectations that the English and French formed of this country were the cause of continual wars and hostilities between the two nations, and these lasted until the peace of Utrecht, in which, by the 10th article, it was ceded entirely to the former ; then followed the company's establishment, of the four factories, called Churchill, Fort York, Albany, and Moose River : the second, which is considered the most important, is situate on the .?. arm of the river Hayes, five leagues above where this enters the sea ; at this factory it is reckoned, that from 40 to 50,000 fine skins are collected annually. 
[The e. boundary of Hudson's bay is Terra de  Labrador ; the n. part has a straight coast, facing the bay, guarded with a line of isles innu nerable. A vast bay, called the Archiwinnipy Sea, lies within it, and opens into Hudson's bay, by means of gulf Hazard, through which the Beluga whales pass in great numbers. The depth of water in the middle of the bay is 140 fathoms. From cape Churchill to the s. end of the bay, are regular soundings, near the shore, shallow, with muddy or .^andy bottom. To the n. of Churchill, the soundings are irregular, the bottom rocky, and in some parts the rocks appear above the surface at low water. In the account of New Britain, we have given a general account of the Hudson's bay companies settlements on both sides of James's bay. The commerce in the countries adjacent to this inland sea, is in the hands of an exclusive British company of its name, who employ only four ships and ISO seamen. The forts, Prince of Wales, Churchill River, Nelson, New Severn, and Albany, are garrisoned by 186 men. The French, in i782, took and destroyed these settlements, &c. said to amount to the value of 500,000/. sterling. The company's exports are to the amount ol 16,000/. mostly the drugs of the market, which produce returns, chiefly in beaver skins and rich furs, to the value of 29,000/. ; yielding government a clear revenue of 6734/. : this includes the fishery in Hudson's bay. The skins and fun procured by this trade, when manufactured, afford articles for trading with many nations ol Europe to great advantage. See index to additional information respecting Canada.] 
[Hudson's City, a port of entry and posttown ; situated in Columbia county, New York, on the e. side of Hudson's river, 23 miles s. of Albany, and 97 n. of New York city. The limits of the corporation include a square mile, and its privileges as a port of entry extend no farther. In the autumn of 1783, Mess. Seth and Thomas Jenkins, from Providence, in the state of Rhode Island, fixed on the unsettled spot, whereon this city stands, for a town, to which the city is navigable for vessels of any size. The city is laid out intc large squares, bordering on the river, and divided into 30 lots. Other adventurers were admitted tc proportions, and the town was laid out in squares, formed by spacious streets, crossing each other al right angles. Each square contains 30 lots, twe deep, divided by a 20 feet alley. Each lot is 5C feet in front, and 120 feet in depth. In the spring of 1784, several houses and stores were erected, The increase of the town from this period to the spring of 1786, two years only, was astonishingly rapid, and reflects great honour upon the enter-    HUD  

HUD  prising and persevering spiritof the original foundrs. In the space of time just mentioned no less tban 50 dwellinghouses, besides shops, barns, and ther buildings, four warehouses, several wharfs, permaceti works, a covered ropewalk, and one f the best distilleries in America, were erected, nd 1500 souls collected on a spot, which three cars before was improved as a farm, and but two ears before began to be built. Its increase since as been very rapid ; a printingoffice has been stablished, and several public buildings have een erected, besides dwellinghouses, stores, &c. Hie inhabitants are plentifully and conveniently upplied with water, brought to their cellars in rocden pipes from a spring two miles from the awn. It has a large bay to the s. and stands on n eminence, from which are extensive and deightful views to the n. w., n., and round that way to athes. e. consisting of hills and valleys, varieated with woods and orchards, corn fields and leadows, with the river, which is in most places mile over, and may be seen a considerable disince to the n. forming a number of bays and reeks. From the s. e. to the s. w. the city is creened with hills at different distances, and w. far off over the river and a large valley, the prosicct is bounded by a chain of stupendous mounstins, called the Katts Kill, running to the a), n. w. chich add magnificence and sublimity to the chole scene. Upwards of 1200 sleighs entered he city daily for several days together, in Feiruary 1786, loaded with grain of various kinds, >oards, shingles, staves, hoops, iron ware, stone or building, fire wood, and sundry articles of irovision for the market, from which some idea nay be formed of the advantage of its situation rith respect to the country adjacent, which is ivery way extensive and fertile, particularly w. L'he original proprietors of Hudson offered to purchase a tract of land adjoining the s. part of the he city of Albany, and were constrained, by a efusal of the proposition, to become competitors or the commerce of the n. country, when othervise they would have added great wealth and conequence to Albany. There is a bank here, calld Bank of Columbia, whose capital may not exceed 160,000 dollars. It is composed of 400 hares, at 400 dollars each. Hudson city is governed by a mayor, recorder, four aldermen, four issistants, and a number of other officers. The lumber of inhabitants in Hudson township, by the census of 1790, amounted to 2584, including 193 laves ; and it appears by the state census of 1796, hat 338 of the inhabitants are electors.

[Hudson River passes its whole course in the state of New York, and is one of the largest and finest rivers in the United States. It rises in a mountainous country, between the lakes Ontario and Champlain. In its course s. e. it approaches within six or eight miles of lake George ; then, after a short course e. turns s. and receives the Sacondaga from the s. w. which heads in the neighbourhood of Mohawk river. The course of the river thence to New York, where it empties into York bay, is very uniformly s. 12 or 15. zo. Its whole length is about 250 miles. From Albany to lake George it is 43 miles. This distance, the river is navigable only for batteaux, arid has two portages, occasioned by falls, of half a mile each. The banks of Hudson's river, especially on the w. side, as far as the highlands extend, are chiefly rocky cliffs. The passage through the highlands, which is 16 or 18 miles, affords a wild romantic scene. In this narrow pass, on each side  of which the mountains tower to a  the wind, if there be any,  great  height.  is collected and compressed, and blows continually as through a bellows ; vessels, in passing through it, are often obliged to lower their sails. The bed of this river, which is deep and smooth to an astonishing distance, through a hilly, rocky country, and even through ridges of some of the highest mountains in the United States, must undoubtedly have been produced by some mighty convulsion in nature. The tide flows a few miles above Albany, which is 160 miles from New York. It is navigable for sloops of 80 tons to Albany, and for ships to Hudson. Ship navigation to Albany is interrupted by a number of islands and shoals, six or eight miles below the city, called the Overslaugh. It has been in contemplation to confine the river to one channel, by which means it will be deepened, and the difficulty of approaching Albany with vessels of a larger size be removed. About 60 miles above New York the water becomes fresh. The river is stored with a variety of fish, which renders a summer passage to Albany delightful and amusing to those who are fond of angling. The advantages of this river for carrying on the fur trade with Canada, by means of the lakes, are very great. Its conveniences for internal commerce are singularly] i

*  HUE  happy. The produce of the remotest farms is easily and speedily conveyed to a certain and profitable market, and at the lowest expence. In this respect New York has greatly the advantage of Philadelphia. A great proportion of the produce of Pennsylvania is carried to market in waggons, over a great extent of country, some of which is rough ; hence it is that Philadelphia is crowded with waggons, carts, horses and their drivers, to do the same business that is done in New York, where all the produce of the country is brought to market by water with much less shew and parade. But Philadelphia has other advantages to compensate for this natural defect. The increasing population of the fertile lands upon the v. branches of the Hudson, must annually increase the amazing wealth that is conveyed by its waters to New York. The n. and w. canals, when completed, will be of incalculable advantage to the trade of this state.]

These Indians had made considerable advances in civilization, could generally speak the English language, and numbers of them made profession of their faith in the Christian religion. In the church which is now standing, they used to attend public worship in the Episcopal form. These Indians are now settled, a part of them on Grand river, a n. water of lake Erie, and a part of them in another part of Upper Canada. None of this nation now remain in the United States.

==[[Hurones|HURONES]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians, who ive near the former lake, in Canada. Their true lame is Yendats, which they have lost for another riven them by the French ; for these seeing their ?ery short hair, and willing to express their surmise at the curious appearance these Indians malifested, exclaimed " quells heures," and from    thence they were afterwards called Hurones. If we" may credit the traditions of this nation, it was formerly divided into four cantons or settlements, which afterwards increased to six, and from this augmentation it was that this nation is so much comparatively larger than those which surround it. The country that these Indians inhabited at the beginning of the last century [1700] had for limits the lake Erie to the 5. the Huron to the w. and the Ontario to the e. It is situate between lat. 42° and 45° n> and in it were very many settlements. The number of souls at the present day amount to 50,000. The territory is not the most fertile of New France ; but some parts of it are so. It is of a healthy climate; and notwithstanding all that the French have experienced here from scarcity and other calamities, in consequence of the wars, no one ever died here of sickness. It abounds in beautiful prairies, which produce much wheat, and it would produce other fruits were it cultivated. The woods are full of trees, especially of cedars, which are very lofty and bulky. It is watered by many rivers of delicate water, and it is said that there are found here certain stones, which may be melted down like metals, and which contain veins of. silver. We also learn, by the assurances of some historians, that some of the rarest animals are found in this country ; the one a bird which mews like a cat, another a kind of hare which sings like a bird, the flesh of which is delicate to eat. The Hurones have maintained a cruel and bloody war for many years with the Iroquees and the Algonquines, who were formerly their allies ; and in this war the numbers of either of the parties engaged has considerably diminished, according to the history written by the Father Pedro Xavier de Charlevoix. This author says, that its government, customs, and religion, is a chaos impossible to be comprehended. The French regulars of the company of Jesuits established some missions amongst the natives to reduce them to the Catholic faith, and the Father Brebeuf, who assisted at them for many years, Avrote several particulars touching their laws and extravagancies.

It takes its name from Mr. Iberville, who, at the beginning of the year 1700, built a little fort near the bay of Bilcohi, where he left 50 men well provided with every necessary. The French, in endeavouring to avoid the danger and difficulty of navigating the principal mouth of the Mississippi, have found this the readiest and surest pass, and it is now some time since they first adopted it. It was on this account that the river became part of their frontier, for it was agreed in the peace of 1762, that the confines between the dominions of the crowns of England and France should be thenceforward irrevocably fixed by a line drawn by the river Mississippi, from its source up to the river Iberville, and another through the middle of this, and through the lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain, as far as the sea.

It is in length 50 leagues from n. to s. and in width 24 from e. to w. at the broadest part. Its temperature is somewhat hotter than that of Lima, for the soil is sandy, and particularly so towards the coast ; here, therefore, it is found to have various desert tracts through the want of moisture : but the province may be said altogether to abound in every kind of fruit, grain, and pulse, most particularly in grapes, the vines yielding their fruits in many parts solely from the moisture they derive from the earth, since there is no more rain here than there is at Lima and the other provinces of the coast. In the parts where the moisture is most prevalent, the natives are accustomed, with great industry, to make certain large lioles or pits, in which they cultivate stocks of vines and other plants. The wines and brandies manufactured here are carried to Lima, Panama, Guayaquil, and to some of the provinces of the Sierra. Here are many pastures used for the support of the beasts of burthen, and a great number of asses, by which animals they carry on their trade.

==[[Illinois|ILLINOIS]]==, a nation of Indians of New France or Canada in N, America, who dwell in the vici-  nities of the lake and of the river of its name, having also the nomination of Albinos, which signifies a man of large stature, this being the peculiar characteristic of these Indians, in comparison with those by whom they are surrounded. They live in villages far separated from each other, in marshy plains or llanuras bordering upon the river, and amongst woods and hills, which maintain their verdure at least nine months in the year. The territory has such an abundance of pasture, that it is covered with large and small cattle, and with every kind of animal of the chase. Their settlements are large, and their cabins constructed with some art, being of an oblong figure, covered with reeds so closely put together as to be proof against winds, rain, and snow. Each cabin contains five or six habitations for so many families, who live united and pacifically together. The chief settlement may amount to about 500 houses ; its exterior is of ordinary appearance,, but the interior has greater signs of civilization, and underneath some of the cabins are cellars, in which they keep their maize, roots, and flesh of animals caught in the chase ; this last article being their principal food. The French missionaries of the Jesuits reduced these Indians to the Catholic faith ; though before this time, according to the Father Charlevoix, there were not to be found in the whole of Canada savages more barbarous or of worse qualities ; so great is the influence of Christianity over the mind, and such was the astonishing alteration it produced amongst these people. They were always of a tractable and docile nature, but at the same time cowardly, treacherous, inconstant, thievish, brutal, without honour, interested, abandoned to all kinds of excess, and the most shameless incontinence ; this last vice being, indeed, most common to all the other Indians of Canada. They are courteous and affable to those who have the government in their country, and testify great warmth of affection towards those for whom they have a friendship ; but they are extremely cunning and revengeful, of lofty stature, robust, and well made, very swarthy, extremely agile and dexterous in bodily exercises, and much given to the employment of the chase. They have many wives ; but in order to avoid dissensions, they prefer marrying their sisters and near relations ; and of these they are so jealous, that they put them to death at the mere suspicion of infidelity. This nation extends itself not only the whole length of the river of its name, but tor a great extent alonor the Misispi on either shore. The Illinois and the Miamesis or Meames live mixed together in one spot, called the Fork ; which is formed by the conilux   I L L    of the river Meame with another running in a s. direciion from the Fifteenmiles portage, which is between this river and the river St. Joseph, running into the lake Michigan. At the conflux of the river St. Mary's with the Meame, and near the said Forks, on the e. side of the Meame, stands Fort Meame, now called Fort Wayme ; and on the w. side of the river stands the village of Meame or Miami, which at some distance has the appearance of a fortress. It is surrounded by a palisade, a certain indication that it has been an entrenchment of the Illinois or Miamesis. At the foot of this village is an island in the middle of the river, surrounded by many other fertile and delightful islands ; and in the largest of these is a settlement, where the cacique or chief resides. Neither of these nations manifest any valour or discipline in their combats. They make an irregular attack, but with great impetuosity and dreadful shouts; but directly one of them falls, the rest fly in disorder, seeking security in flight. Their principal prowess is manifested in ambuscades, and they have the patience to remain in this manner for eight or nine days, that in the end they may have an opportunity of killing or making captive the passing enemy. When any of their combats against another nation has met with a successful termination, they order their march so that they may arrive at their settlement just before nightfall, and forming themselves in order to make their entry, send before them a chief to give notice of their fortune, of the spoil, and the number of prisoners they have made; and after this they enter with great testimonies of joy, singing songs expressive of victory, and dancing ; but if they may have been defeated, they enter in the daytime, and in place of joyful acclamations, they signify their misfortune by notes of sorrow and bowlings ; and then retiring to their cabins brood in sullen silence over their disasters. [Illinois, a large navigable river of the N. W. Territory, formed by the confluence of the rivers Plein and Theakiki, in lat. 41° 43' n. Long. 86° 3o' to. This noble branch of the Mississippi, after running a serpentine s. w. course, through an extensive country of rich, fertile land, and receiving a vast number of rivers from 20 to 100 yards wide, which are navigable for boats fro'tn 15 to 180 miles, approaches within five miles of the Mississippi; from thence running e. about 12 miles, it pays its tribute by a mouth 400 yards wide, in lat. 38° 40'??. and in long. 90° 12' a). ; opposite the large cave, 100 miles above the Ohio and 12 above the Missouri. The lands on the banks of the Illinois, particularly those on the s. e. side, are perhaps as 

VOL. II.  fertile as any part of N. America. They produce in the most luxuriant plenty wheat, rye, Indian corn,peas, beans, flax, hemp, tobacco, hops, grapes, apples, pears, peaches, dyeing roots, medicinal plants, &c. Here also grow large forests of hickory, oak, cedar, mulberry trees, &c. Savannas, or natural meadows, are both numerous and extensive. In the forests are great variety of animals, as buffaloes, deer, &c. ; and in the rivers are plenty of fish, particularly cat, carp, and perch, of an enormous size. Such is the abundance of wild grapes in this country, that in the year 1769, the French planters upon this river made above 110 hogsheads of strong wine from these grapes. On the n. w. side of this river is a coal mine, which extends for half a mile along the middle of its banks; and about the same distance below the coal mine are two salt ponds, 100 yards in circumference, and several feet in depth. The water is stagnant and of a yellowish colour ; but the French and natives make a good salt from it. The Illinois furnishes a communication with lake Michigan, by Chicago river, between which and the Illinois are two portages, the length of which do not exceed four miles. The whole length of the river from, the source of Theakiki, which is but a short distance from the river St. Joseph, opposite to fort St. Joseph on the n. is 280 miles. The Indians have ceded to the United States, by the treaty of Greenville in 1795, a tract of land 12 miles square, at or near the mouth of the Illinois; also a tract six miles square, at the Old Piarias fort and village near the s. end of Illinois lake. By the census of 1810, the population of this territorial government amounted to 12,282 souls. The aforesaid lake is only a dilatation of the river, and is situated about 140 miles below the source of Theakiki, and 43 below the Salt ponds. It is 16 miles long, and five miles broad in the middle.]

==[[Lndians|LNDIANS]]==, a general name given to all the aborigines of the Indies or America. They are scattered over an extent of two prodigious continents, and divided into an infinite number of nations and tribes, differing very little from each other in their customs and modes of life ; all forming a lively picture of the most remote antiquity. The Indians are of a straight stature, and taller than the generality of other nations; are robust, and of a constitution as well equal to temporary exertion, as to surmount the continuance of the greatest hardships and labours. They have the head a little flat, the features regular, the aspect ferocious, and the hair long, black, and strong, like a horse's tail. They have no beards, and their skin is of an obscure red. When the Europeans discovered their countries, they found the natives jquite naked, save in what thecivilized nations hold indispensable. They are all of an uniform appearance, muscular, but thin, whilst their education teaches them only to adapt their bodies to the modes of life they are to follow, and their minds to bear the weight of the greatest calamities. Their uniform occupation is the chase and war ; agriculture they leave to the care of the women, and commerce they despise. When the chase is over, and which they follow with consummate skill and ingenuity, and that they have heaped together their provisions, they pass their time in the greatest indolence, sleep one half of the day, and the other sing and dance with little decency, and cat and drink beyond all limits. Before the arrival of the Europeans, they were not acquainted with any fermented liquor ; but since that time, drunkenness has ever been the sole object of their ambition. In fact, they are scarcely ever sober, and will lie extended upon the ground, exposed to the inclemency of the weather and to the greatest disorders : such, however, as refrain from this pernicious practice live to an old age, enjoying a life full of health and vigour. Their general character is to be ferocious, aU Ways serious and melancholy, respectful to thosein their presence, and particularly so to elders.  

INDIANS.  They are of a cold 'temperament, and never speak without meditating much on what they have to say, and stopping till others have finished ; so that they find great fault with the vivacity of the Europeans, who are in the habit of interrupting each other, and speaking at the same time. In their juntas and councils they observe great silence and veneration for age, capacity, and merit ; and no one is more regardful of the laws of hospitality than the Indian : but with their enemies they are implacable and cruel, and dissemble their anger under the mask of friendship till they find an opportunity of executing their vengeance i nor will time deaden their animosity, for they will seek their enemy after the lapse of years, travelling to great distances, impeded neither by the asperity of the mountains and deserts, the dread of wild beasts, nor the impetuosity of torrents : they are in such a case alike insensible to the inclemency of the season, and the extremes of hunger and thirst, that they may glut themselves with his flesh. Notwithstanding this, they are not captious, but will submit quietly to affronts and insults. Liberty, taken in its widest sense, is their ruling passion ; and for it they sacrifice all; leading, upon the whole, a life replete with misery and wretchedness. Although the women bear the weight of domestic drudgery and labour in general, yet are they much respected. Some nations tolerate polygamy, but this is not common to all. It is well worthy of remark, that although some of them are so incredibly stupid that they appear rather like brutes than rational beings, and even wanting at times the instinct of the former, others have been found to possess a nice and lively discrimination, and to have well formed ideas. 
If the total indifference of the Indian to temporal things were balanced by a corresponding regard to spiritual, they might well be called happy ; for they enjoy an undisturbed tranquillity in all the concerns of life, prosperous or unfortunate. Their vesture is humble ; if it is torn by accident, it concerns them not, nor do they even desire a better. They despise riches and authority, and it is equal to them whether they be a cacique or a vassal ; and for this reason there is no reciprocal esteem amongst them. Their food is not less simple than their vesture ; and, in short, nothing can move or excite them, nor can they be stimulated by fear, or obliged by force. So invincible is their stupidity, and so contented are they with their lot, that no endeavours can instruct them ; so slow, that it is common to say of a work which is of little moment, but which will take much time, that it is the labour  of an Indian; since they will, in making carpets* quilts, and other articles, actually count the threads one by one. They are naturally of a mechanical turn, and would, without instruction, make considerable improvements in the arts. They marry, in order that they may have servants in their wives, to do whatever may be necessary ; namely, spinning, making shirts and shoes, dressing the food, preparing the maize, baking the rice, and making chicha; whilst they squat down (this being their general posture) before the fire, without moving but to eat. If any traveller loses his Avay, and arrives at the cabin, they hide themselves, and teil their wives to say that they are not at home / ; and although all that you might require of them were that they should attend you only for half a quarter of a league, nothing can induce them to acquiesce. 
Their habitations are small, the fireplace is in the middle, and they "live with the animals which they keep, holding in great esteem the dogs, and seldom having less about them than three or tour. The bed consists of two or three sheepskins, without any thing else whatever. They sleep huddled together, and always without undressing. Superstition is general amongst them ; it is from the most remote antiquity. They believe auguries and divinations, and are so infatuated that it is difficult to persuade them of their error, and to make tliem embrace the Catholic religion ; and indeed, when this is the case, they are prompted to it by mere ceremony, or from fear of chastisement. 
Such is the general character of the Indians, although in the settlements of the missions of Paraguay, and amongst those who have been educated amongst the Spaniards in the province of Quito and other parts, there are some civilized, intelligent in the arts, and regular followers of their religion, these being called Ladinos. The disease of the smallpox, which was unknown to them before the arrival of the Spaniards, and which they have experienced every six or seven years, has destroyed millions ; and when it occurs, death is almost inevitable, and whole settlements are swept off at once. As it is not possible to reduce under one article the whole history of the Indians, whoever wishes to be further instructed concerning them, may consult the chronologer Antonio de Herrera, Fr. Gregorio Garcia, Don Antonio de Ulloa, and the Father Lafliteau. [See also description of the natives of Cuba, and other islands, in this work.] 
[We consider the account of the Indians, given by Alcedo, relating exclusively to tnose inhabiting    INDIANS.  
[S. America, or such parts as comprise the Spanish colonies,, 
Some writers have conjectured the number of aboriginal inhabitants, or Indians, in America, to be under 2,500,000; but this we conceive to be egregiously under the mark; and can only account for the falsity of the calculation from the little genuine intelligence those writers possessed of every thing respecting the s. continent. It is true that at the time of the discovery of America, the island of Hispaniola alone contained at least 1,000,000 of inhabitants ; Bartholomew de las Casas estimated the number at 3,000,000 ; and millions were said to be buried in the mines, or hunted to death by the Spaniards, both on the islands and continent. 
In the n. parts of America, numbers were doubtless destroyed in forming the English, Dutch, and French colonies ; but notwithstanding the ruptures between the colonists and the Indians, very few comparatively perished by war. Famine, and its companion the pestilence, frequently destroy whole tribes. The diseases also introduced by the Europeans have made great havoc. The spirituous liquors, in the use of which they have been initiated by the whites, prove perhaps most of all repugnant to population. They waste as the Europeans advance, they moulder away, and disappear. The most numerous tribes are at the greatest distance from the settlements of the whites ; and it is very certain that in proportion to their distance they are unacquainted with the use -of firearms. All the nations n. of lake Superior, and those beyond the Mississippi, use only bows and arrows ; so that when their scattered situation is considered, the various customs and superstitions which it would be necessary to reconcile, in order to produce unity of action, and what a small proportion of them have the apparatus, or understand the use of musketry, or possess resources to enable them to carry on lasting hostilities against the power of the United States, it must be obvious, that even partial defeats of the federal troops will hasten their ruin, notwithstanding the wonderful dexterity and intrepidity which they exhibited in several actions with the regular troops in the late war. But this neither is nor ought to be the wish of the inhabitants of the United States ; they ought to teach them the blessings of peace, and curb the exorbitant lust of farther extent of territory. 
A list of Indian tribes, in Imlay's History of Kentucky, makes the aggregate number less than 60,000 who inhabit the country from the gulf of Mexico, on both sides of the Mississippi, to the  gulf of St. Lawrence, and as far w. as the country has been generally explored ; that is, to the head water of the Mississippi, and from thence a good way up the Missouri, and between that river and Santa Fe. 
The population of the Indian nations in the s. parts of the United States, somewhat different from Imlay, is, according to Mr. Purcell, who resided  among them in 1780, as follows :  
Muscogees, commonly called 
Creeks, Chactaws, Chickasaws, Cherokees, Catabaws,  
Gunmen. Total.  
5,860 4,131 
575 2,800 17,280 
13,425 
2,290 
8,55C 13,516 42,033 The above Red nations have increased in a small degree since the general peace established among them in 1777. The whites incorporated among them are few in number, and lead a vagabond life, going from tribe to tribe as their restless disposition leads them. The increase of population is considerably checked by the quantities of adulterated and poisonous spirituous liquors, and the venereal distemper, introduced among them by the whites. 
Majorgeneral Anthony Wayne put an end to the destructive war with the Indians, by a treaty of peace and friendship concluded at Greenville, Aug. 3, 1795, which was ratified by the president of the United States, Dec. 22, 1795. The Indian tribes signed the treaty in the following order : Wyandots, Delawares, Shawanoes, Ottawas, Chipawas, Ottawa, Patawatames of the river of St. Joseph, Patawatames of Huron, Miamies, Miamis and Eel River, Eel River tribe, Miamis, Kickapoos and Kaskaskias, Delawares of Sandusky, and some of the Six Nations living at Sandusky. These Indians ceded to the United States various tracts of land from two to 12 miles square, near the different posts in the N. W. Territory. The United States delivered to the Indian tribes above named goods to the value of 20,000 dollars ; and agreed to deliver in goods to the value of 9500 dollars annually, for ever. The portion which each tribe is to receive svill be seen in the account of the particular nation or tribe. 
Little is yet known of the Indians in the inferior parts of N. America. In 1792, Mr. Stewart, said to be in the employ of the British court, returned from four years travels through the hitherto unexplored regions to the w. Taking his course w. s. w.l 
2 .      [from the posts on the lakes, he penetrated to the head of the Missouri, and from thence due w. to within 500 miles of the shores of the Pacific ocean. He joined the interior Indians in several battles against the Shore Indians : ail which coining' short of his object, the procuring a peace, so that he might exp'ore the continent from sea to sea ; after some stay, lie returned nearly by the same route he had pursued in going out. Beyond the Missouri, Mr. Stewart met with many powerful nations, in general hospitable and courteous. The Indian nations he visited w. appeared to be a polished and civilized people, having towns regularly built, and being in a stateof society not far removed from that of the Europeans, and only wanting the use of iron and steel to be perfectly so. They are always clad in skins cut in an elegant manner, and in many respects preferable to the garments in use among the whites. Adjacent to these nations is a vast ridge of mountains, which may be called the Alleghany of the w. parts of America, and serves as a barrier against the too frequent incursions of the Coast Indians, who entertain a mortal antipathy to the nations and tribes inhabiting the country e. of the mountains.

IN I  mander of the brigautine Hope of Boston, who discovered them on the 19th of April 1791, a day remarkable in the annals of America, the revolutionary war having commenced on that day in 1775, and the first discoveries made under the flag of the United States marked its 16th anniversary. These islands, lying between lat. 8° 3' and 9° 24' 5. and between long. 140° 19' and 141° 18' &. from Greenwich, are mostly inhabited, and appear to be generally variegated with hills and valleys, abounding with timber and very pleasant.

The township of Ipswich is divided info five parishes, and contains 601 houses and 4502 inhabitants. There is an excellent stone bridge across Ipswich river, composed of two arches, with one solid pier in the bed of the river, which connects the two parts of the town, executed under the direction of the late Hon. Judge Choate. This was heretofore a place of much more consideration than at present. Its decline is attributed to a barred harbour and shoals in the river. Its natural situation is pleasant, and on all accounts exceedingly well calculated to be a large manufacturing town. The supreme judicial court, the courts of common pleas and sessions, are held here once a year, on the first Tuesday of April; and from its" central situation, it appears to be the most convenient place for all the courts and public offices of the county. The inhabitants are chiefly farmers, except those in the compact part of the township. A few vessels are employed in the fishery, and a few trade to the W.Indies. Silk and thread lace of an elegant texture are manufactured here by women and children, in large quantities, and sold for use and exportation in Boston, and other mercantile towns. In 1790, no less than 41,979 yards were made here, and the manufacture is rather increasing. Ipswich township was incorporated in 1634, and is 255 miles n. e. of Philadelphia. Lat. 42° 39' n.

It was discovered by Pedro de Vergara, who was sent by Gonzalo Pizarro in 1558, and was shortly afterwards subjected by Juan de Salinas, who was its first governor. It was at that time called Silla, and Chacaigna or Igualsongo, and Pacamoras, the latter of which titles it preserved for many years, until that the Indians making an insurrection, destroyed the principal towns : the inhabitants, after the lapse of half a century, again becoming settled in the city of Jaen, which gave the name to the province, and the former titles being entirely lost, it added to this name that of Yaguarsingo and Bracamoros. It is of a very mild temperature, abounding in cotton, of which are made good woven stuffs, also in cacao of an excellent quality, wild wax, and tobacco; these productions being carried to Lima and to the kingdom of Chile, through the province of Piura and its valleys, and being sold there at a high price. It has pastures wherein are bred a sufficient number of mules and horses; rich mines of gold, although not ofthe finest quality, and washing places, where the Indians collect this metal in considerable quantities. In its woods are abundance of wild beasts and animals, such as tigers, leopards, bears, and dantas, called here the great beast, and inhabiting the cold parts ofthe Cordillera. This province is watered by the rivers Guancobamba, Chinchipe, Paracassa, Turumbasa, Numballe, Palanda, Simanchi, Sangalla, and San Francisco, which divides the bishopric of Quito from that of Truxillo. Its population is very small, and reduced to the cities of Jnen, Loyola, Valladolid, and Santiago de las Montanas ; but improperly so called, as they are in fact nothing but poor settlements, in a state of ruin and wretchedness, as indeed are the follow-

==[[Jamaica|JAMAICA]]==, a large island of the>N. sea, one of the Greater Antilles, discovered by Admiral Christopher Columbus, in 1494, in his second voyage, when he changed its name to that of Santiago, which it preserved as long as it was in  
JAM  the power of the Spaniards, but which it lost in 1655, when it was taken by certain English sent out in a powerful squadron by the Protector Cromwell, and commanded by Admiral Penn ; Colonel Venables directing the disembarkation of the troops, who met with a severe repulse on their landing. The island was, however, afterwards ceded by the Spaniards to the English, having at that time no more than' 3000 inhabitants, including Negro slaves, and no other commerce than that done by the pirates. After the restoration of King Charles II. to the English throne, its population became increased to 18,000 inhabitants, and these began to cultivate cacao and sugarcane, and to collect salt ; so that it has become, at the present day, one of the most commercial, fertile, and rich provinces of all America. 
It is the largest island of the Antilles, excepting those of Cuba and S. Domingo, and lies between lat. 17° 44' and 18° 32' n. and between long. 76° 6' and 78° 18' w. ; is 124 geographical miles long from the point of Negrillo to the w. to the point of Morante to the e. and 44 at its widest part, namely, from the point of Gallina to the n. to the point of Portland to the s. and is of an oval figure. It is extremely well situate tor commerce, being 170 miles s. of the island of Cuba, and 196 w. of the island of S. Domingo, with the advantages of 16 large bays and 30 ports, or places where there is secure anchorage for vessels. It is intersected by a chain of mountains which run through nearly the whole island from e. to w. ; the w. part of the same being called the Blue Mountains ; and from these flow innumerable rivers abounding in every species offish, and many of them being navigable in canoes, so that the sugarcanes of the different plantations are thus brought down to the coast. These mountains are covered with trees of different kinds, particularly the cedar, lignumvitae, and caob, and exhibit a constant verdure. Some of the woods rise higher than the rest ; and this variation, together with the different colours of the foliage, combined with the plantations, form at a distance a delightful prospect. Some of the rivers have, after a violent tempest, changed both their course and their name, and many run for leagues under ground. The celebrated Dr. Sloane enumerates more than 100 rivers, which would more properly be called torrents ; for their course being generally but for a few miles before they enter the sea, they carry down with them large stones, pieces of timber, and sand or earth, so that the stream becomes quite choked in many places, and at others precipitates itself down a fall of 50 or CO feet. The water of the fountains distant from    •  
*   310  

JAMAICA.  the sea is preferred to the riverwater, and particularly to that in the vicinity of Port Royal, where it is thick, and occasions flux and other disorders to those who drink it. Here are various fountains and rivers, the waters of which are accustomed so to petrify the aqueducts as to impede their course. 
The river the most worthy of those to be noted is that of Abraham's Plantation, in the n. of the island. Near the point of Morante, in the e. part, there is in a wood a bath of warm water, which being taken internally and bathed in, cures the cholic, an infirmity very common here. Nearly two miles from the sea there rises from the mountains certain salt streams, which united form the river De la Sal. This river forms pools where the seawater meets it, and the moisture being exhaled from these by the heat of the sun, a great quantity of salt is deposited, which, although not very white, is often found in large lumps. Here are various lakes ; and that called Rioboa receives an abundant supply of water from a river of an invisible course. 
The climate of Jamaica is mild, and more varying than that of the other islands; nor is there a country under the tropics where the heat is less troublesome ; for the wind, which regularly blows from the e. and which is called briza, brings with it often such refreshing showers, as to render the nights delightful. Towards the c. and w. of the island, the temperature is not so good as to the *. and n. owing to the thick woods which are in the former, rendering those parts more subject to tempests of wind and rain. In the mountainous parts the air is much colder. Although it generally rains in January, yet are May, October, and November, looked upon as the winter months, on account of the tempests of thunder and lightning which then prevail, and which will frequently last for days together without intermission, inundating the territory, and leaving the roads impassable. The whole year round there is a regular intense heat in the morning, from eight o'clock till the briza springs up. This wind the common people have christened the Doctor, and whilst it lasts the Negroes labour it) the fields, and every one engages himself in his respective occupation. This wind comes from the sea, and has the appearance of smoke: it continues increasing in power till twelve o'clock, when it is at the highest; and then dying gradually away, it ceases at five till the next morning. At eight at night the landbreeze springs up, and blows four leagues from the coast, and continues increasing until twelve o'clock, when it begins to die away, and at four in the  morning is entirely gone. The former of these winds is stronger at some times than at others, particularly during the full moons, and in December. January, and February, when the n. winds prevail, so as to become confounded with it ; though it is always less felt near the sea, except in Port Royal and fort Del Paso, where it is stronger and lasts longer. The landbreeze is felt later in the city than in the abovementioned places. As the tropical winds do not blow directly from the e. but vary from n. e. to «?. e. according to the position of the sun ; so the seabreeze varies in the same proportion, not always blowing from the same point ; this not being the case with the landbreeze, which comes regularly from the mountains of the s. and n. parts. Sometimes the seabreeze blows in the winter months for 14 days and nights successively ; and then there is not a cloud to be seen, but a dew falls, though not even this, when the n. winds prevail. These breezes have no influence in the valleys amidst the mountains, but the n. winds root up the trees. As the landbreeze springs up at night, and the seabreeze in the day, it is according to them that vessels can either enter or leave the port, namely, entering it in the daytime and leaving it at night. The n. winds are more frequent when the sun is nearest to the tropic of Capricorn, and consequently furthest s. : it is then that the nights are cold and unsalutary; for these winds being joined by the landbreeze become so powerful as to dry up the sugar plantations and the vegetables in the parts lying towards the n. ; but in the part towards the s. its violence is mitigated by the interposition of the mountains. It should be observed, that this wind is seldom attended with rain. Tempests were scarcely known in this island until 70 or 80 [100 or 110] years ago, when occurred those terrible hurricanes and earthquakes which caused such infinite mischief, and particularly to the shipping. The nights are very fresh, and in them falls a dew which is esteemed noxious, and more particularly to newcomers. In the llanuras and plains the rains are violent. The ebb and the flow of the tides are scarcely to be distinguished, being so much dependent on the winds. During the whole year ihe days and nights are equal or nearly so, the longest day being 13 hours and the night 11 ; the twilight not lasting more than threequarters of an hour. The months of July, August, and September, are called the hurricane months ; and there is, in fact, scarcely a year that passes but some hurricanes are experienced. The strong n. winds bring sometimes tempests, with hail and flashes of lightning, which last the whole night, but without th under.  

JAMAICA.  though, when this does occur, the peals are dreadful. Earthquakes are as common here as in the island of S. Domingo ; and they have done infinite mischief, as was the case in the years 1687 and 1692. Shortly after the latter period, the city of Port Royal was burnt, and has not since been rebuilt. Hurricanes, in short, are what are most to be dreaded in this island : one of the most dreadful happened in 1712 ; and this was followed by another equally distressing in 1722, accompanied by an earthquake. 
The mountains are steep, and some inaccessible, from being surrounded by great chasms, and torrents formed by the rains. The valleys are very level, and the soil without stones. Only one part of the island is cultivated; and, indeed, were it entirely so, it would produce three times as much as it does at present. There are plantations on all the coast, but not far inland. There are certain meadows and llanuras where the Indians sow maize; but the grass is so high, and pasturage in such quantities, that the Spaniards, who although rather devoted to breeding cattle than to agriculture, were under the necessity of burning it. 
The native productions of this island are sugar, rum, ginger, cotton, coffee, indigo, pepper, cacao, several sorts of woods an4 medicinal herbs, and tobacco ; although this not of a very good quality, nor esteemed by others than the Negroes. No kind of European grain grows here save maize, Guinea wheat, and pease of different sorts. The fruits which are most abundant are China oranges, sweet and sour limes, citrons, pomegranates, mameyes, papas, pines, guavas, melons, watermelons, and various kinds of apples and pears, though the latter are only found here and there, and are dissimilar to those of Europe. Besides the above, we must add wild cinnamon, very useful in medicine, mamanilla, a tree of beautiful appearance and excellent wood for ornaments, but of a fruit and juice very poisonous ; the caob used so much by the English, as that it was exported to them in 1770 to the value of 50,000/. ; the palm, from which is extracted much oil, greatly esteemed by the Negroes, as well for food as medicine ; the white leno, used for building ships, as being impervious to the worm; the soaptree, the fruit of which answers the purpose of that article for washing; the pah Colorado (red wood) and wood of Campeche for dyeing, the guayacan, zarzaparilla, China, casca, tamarind, aloe, and cochineal. Of these productions there used to be exported yearly, of sugar 1000 arrobas, 30,000 azumbres of rum, as many of molasses, 3,000,000 of pounds of pepper, 500 bags of ginger of 500 lbs. each, 1000  of  bags of cotton of 180 lbs. each, 800 chests coffee of 300 lbs. each, and with all these an immense quantity of the drugs above enumerated. But the principal commerce is that which it does with the Spaniards of Tierra Firrae^ and Nueva Espana, in the sale of Negroes and European effects to the amount of 5,000,000 dollars annually. Few islands abound so much in cattle as does this : horses, mules, and asses, are very cheap here, and the cows and oxen, although large, might be larger, did not the natives entirely give themselves up to their plantations ; supplying themselves with fleshmeat from the n. colonies. The sheep are wellsized, and their flesh is good, but their wool is inferior: here are plenty of goats, kids, rabbits, and swine. In the bays, ports, and rivers, are abundance of fish of all sorts ; amongst which the tortoise is most esteemed. Here are many kinds of fowl, wild and domestic, more parrots than in any other island, woodcocks, Guinea fowl, pigeons, geese, ducks, pelicans, and fragatas, the fat of which is used medicinally. Here are also fireflies, which are a species of cantharides, are luminous, and appear green in the day and brilliant at night, and this even after they are dead. 
[Jamaica is divided into three counties, Middlesex, Surry, and Cornwall ; subdivided into 20 parishes, as follows : Middlesex contains those of St. Mary, St. Ann, St. John, St. Dorothy, St. Thomas in the Vale, Clarendon, Vere, St. Catherine, the town of Santiago de la Vega, the capital, and 13 villages ; 244 sugar plantations, and 43,626 Negroes. Surry contains the parishes of St. Andrew, St. George, Portland, Port Royal, St. David, St. Thomas in the East, Kingston, the towns of Kingston and Port Royal, eight villages, 159 sugar plantations, and 27,337 Negroes. Cornwall contains the parishes of Trelawney, St. James, Hanover, Westmoreland, St. Elizabeth, the towns of Savannahla-Mar, Montego Bay, and Falmouth, 309 sugar plantations, and 57,835 Negroes. The whole 20 parishes contain 18 churches and chapels, and each parish has a rector and other church officers. Presentations to livings are made by the commanderinchief.] 
In 1736, this island had six fortresses, with the names of Fort Charles or Carlos, in Port Royal ; - Port de la Roca, at the entrance of Kingston, Fort of Port Antonio, Fort William, Fort Morante, and Fort of the bay of Carlisle. The troops consist of nine regiments of militia, infantry, and horse. which contain about SOOO men, also eight companies independent of king's pay. By the law of the island, every male between the age of 16 and 60 is obliged to enlist into the militia. Jn its ecclesins-  JAMAICA.  tical jurisdiction it is, like all the other colonial churches, dependent on the bishop of London ; and in what relates to the political and military departments, it is ruled by a governor nominated by the king of England, who is always a person of the first rank and pretensions, with the title of captaingeneral, admiral, and grandchancellor of the island, with a faculty of appointing to all kinds of commissions, of convening and dissolving the assembly (the which is composed of 12 persons of the first distinction, nominated by the king, and who form the privycouncil ; and 43 representatives of the people, elected by the parishes), and of pardoning all crimes, excepting those of felony and homicide. In short, he possesses a most complete authorty ; and his salary being 2500/. per annum, independently of the magnificent presents offered on his arrival, the allowances made him by the assembly, and what is contributed by the Jews, as well as other emoluments, may be put down at 10,000/. annually; so that this appointment is looked upon as the best under the crown, after the viceroyship of Ireland. 
In 1778, this island had 17,949 white inhabitants, including 8000 Jews, 166,904 Negroes, slaves, bondmen, and Mulattoes, 680 sugar plantations, 1 10 cotton manufactories, 100 plantations of pepper, SO of ginger, 150 of coffee, and eight indigo manufactories. In 1735, there was an insurrection amongst the Negro slaves, who, retiring to the mountains, made war against the English ; and although they were generally subdued, there still remain some maintaining the stronger positions, and frequently making sallies, in which they do considerable mischief. Whilst this island was in the power of the Spaniards, after it was conquered and settled by Juan de Esquibel in 1509, it was under the jurisdiction of an abbacy, erected in 1514, and was given as a property to Admiral Christopher Columbus, and made amarquisate, entailed on the firstborn of the Dukes of Veragua, who maintain the title to the present day. It is 140 leagues from the coast of Tierra Firme. The capital was Santiago de la Vega, and now Kingston. 
[After the particular and faithful account of this  island delivered by Alcedo, our observations will be chiefly confined to such circumstances as may relate to it in a statistical point of view subsequently to the time he wrote ; namely, to its population and productions. 
Jamaica is said to contain 4,080,000 acres ; ol which 900,000 acres were planted in 1675 ; and in November 1789, there were no more than 1,907,589 acres located or taken up by grants from the crown. The number of white inhabitants, in 1787, was 30,000; freed Negroes 10,000; Maroons 1400 ; and slaves 250,000 ; in all; 304,000. The value of this island as British pro^ perty, at the above period, was estimated as follows : 250,000 Negroes, at 50/. sterling each, 12| millions; the landed and personal property and buildings to which they are appurtenant, 25 millions more ; the houses and property in the towns, and the vessels employed in trade, If millions; in all 39 millions. 
From the report of the committee of legislature in Jamaica, December 20, 1799, there were then. 
Acres. In coffee plantations, - - 15,343 
In sugar plantations, - 105,232 
In provison grounds, - - - 7,771 
These are the only plantations enumerated by acres in this report. Mr. Bryan Edwards, in 1792, states there were then worked by Negroes, 
Negroes.  
Sugar plantations, - 767, Coffee plantations, - 607, Breeding pens, and pastures, 1017, On pimento and cotton plantations, and Negroes in towns, -  
140,000 21,000 31,000  
58,000  
In all, 250,000  
Since Mr. Edwards wrote, the coffee plantations have increased tenfold in produce, and greatly, of course, in number; and the Negroes, in 1805, in Jamaica, may be taken at 280,000. 
Jamaica is an island of so great importance, that it is matter of interest to consider its produce distinctively.

From the above table appear the following results: 
First, That Jamaica alone returns above onehalf of the sugar produced by the whole of the British colonies. 
Secondly, That Jamaica produces above threefourths of the total coffee. 
Thirdly, (and it is the most important result in 

VOL. II.  compilations of this nature), That Jamaica is yet a growing and improving colony ; and that ifs cultivation appearing progressive, and especially of coffee, a further increase of produce may yet be expected, and a further market in Europe become necessary, and to be provided. 
Jamaica exports, and sends to Great Britain yearly, about 20,000 puncheons of rum, being] s s  gfl   3U  

JAMAICA.  
[about twothirds of the total rum freighted home from the British colonies. 
From a table relating to sugar imported to Great Britain, tind from Jamaica, in proportion to the importation from all the other British W. Indies, it is to be noticed, that from 1795 to 1798, a more than ordinary disproportion occurs, by a falling off in the produce of the Windward isles, occasioned by ravage of the plantations in Granada from insurrection, and in St. Vincent's by the Charibes. 
For six years to 1798, Jamaica returned a steady average of about 84,000 hogsheads of sugar. 
The very high prices of sugar in the European market for four years preceding, and highest in 1798, excited speculations of extending the sugar plantations in Jamaica and other islands ; and this, aided with the new and more productive Bourbon cane, accounts for the increase of sugar from Jamaica, progressive, to 1803 ; whilst (with the exception of St. Vincent's and Granada, and above all, Tobago) the Windward islands, having no extra, spare, and fertile lands, to do the same, yet in some degree prpfited by planting the superior species of cane. 
The following statement, whilst it corroborates what we have above observed relative to the growing importance of Jamaica, will shew the wonderful increase which took place in the produce of coffee in that island from the moment the duties were reduced.  
In the year 1752, the total export of coffee from Jamaica was rated at 60,0001bs. In 1775, it was 49,3981bs. Until 1783,it never exceeded 350,0001bs when a reduction of the heavy duty upon it took place. In the year 1790, the quantity was trebled, exceeding two millions and a quarter. In the year 1795, it rose to 5,902, 113lbs. and the following is a statement of its progress since ; the exports being given al? returned each year in the house of assembly by the naval office.

Admiral Rodney enriched this beautiful island with many of the rare productions of the east, which fell into his hands by the fortune of war ; particularly the breadfruit tree, the true Ceylon cinnamon tree, and the mango tree. Jamaica can boast of a botanical garden containing the rarest collection of curious trees and plants perhaps in the world ; of which a catalogue has been published. The botanical garden contains, among other valuable productions, the Chinese hemp, palm, Otaheite plum, tallowtree, gumarabic, papermulberry, from which paper and cloth are made, tea plant, and Chinese olive. The other  productions, both animal and vegetable, are such as are common to the other islands in the W. Indies ; and have been, for the most part, detailed by our author; but mahogany is now become scarce. In many parts of Jamaica there is a great appearance of metals ; and it is believed that the Spaniards had mines both of silver and copper. A lead mine was indeed opened some years ago, near to the Hope estate, in St. Andrew's parish ; but the possessors find more profit in cultivating the surface of the earth than by digging for what may be contained in its bowels. See West Indies, and Cold Spring.}  

JAMAICA.  English Governors who have presided in Jamaica. 
1. Colonel Doyley ; nominated first governor when the English became possessed of the island, in 1655 ; he left off persecuting the Spaniards who remained, and established the colony ; governing with address, when there arrived, nominated by Oliver Cromwell, 
2. Major Sedgwick, whose power lasted but a few months, since he died from the novelty of the food and climate. 
3. The same Colonel Doyley ; who took the government with the general acclamation of the inhabitants ; but as soon as the death of the right owner was known in England, a successor was nominated in, 
4. Colonel Brayne, an Irishman and partizan of the protector ; but he also had the misfortune to die a few days after his arrival at Jamaica with a force of 1000 men, in 1658. 
5. The aforesaid Colonel Doyley, for the third time ; when he was confirmed in his office by parliament, after the death of Oliver Cromwell ; but separated from it at the restoration of Charles II. to the English throne, in 1661. 
6. Lord Windsor ; who established the laws and civil government, and evinced the best dispositions ; but he governed only two years ; for having permitted the Flibustiers to settle in the island, a complaint was made by the court of Spain of the piracies and robberies they committed under the protection of his government, and he was consequently separated from it, in 1663. 
7. Thomas Moddyford, a rich inhabitant of the island of Barbadoes, and who had established himself at Jamaica during the government of the the former. In his time the colony underwent a better organization, and the abolition of the aforesaid piracies tended greatly to increase its wealth. 
8. Thomas Lynch, who followed in the footsteps of the former, giving a commission to the pirate Morgan, in the expeditions made against the Spaniards, at Maracaibo, Granada, Panama, Portobelo, and Chagre ; he was separated from the government by the strong representations made by the Spanish court to England, in 1773. 
9. The Duke of Albemarle; sent with a particular commission to extirpate the pirates ; he issued an order that all such as were apprehended should be hung; and this did not fail soon to remove the evil complained of; he was much venerated in the Spanish parts, and died regretted, in 1689. 
10. LordJusquin; in whose time the French, commanded by Mr. Daviot, invaded the island ; also there occurred in his time the great earth-  quake, in which upwards of 10,000 persons perished, in 1692. 
11. Lord Bellcmont; in his time, the Scotch under his protection established themselves in the province of Darien, but were routed by the governor of Cartagena; he governed until 1708. 
12. Count of Peterbourg ; sent out to renew the hostilities respecting the establishment of Darien, with an authority of impressing for his service all the British vessels that might be in America. 
13. The Duke of Portland ; who was nominated governor in 1721 ; he died in 1726. 
14. The Count Stayrs ; nominated in the same year of 1726; he governed until 1737, when was nominated, 
15. Sir Edward Trelawney; whose reign was the longest and most satisfactory to the court and to the inhabitants of the island ; he suppressed the insurrection of the Indians; leaving the government for England, in 1752. 
16. Admiral Charles Knowles; whose merits had rendered him conspicuous, and who was chosen as successor; he governed until 1761, when he returned to England, and then went to Russia, to arrange some maritime affairs relative to that empire. 
17. William Henry Littleton; governor in 1762; and in 1766, promoted to be ambassador at the court of Lisbon.

A 40-gun ship goes to James town, and lightening herself, may pass to Harrison's bar, on which there is only 15 feet water. Vessels of 250 tons may go to Warwick ; those of 125 go to Rockets's, a mile below Richmond ; from thence is about seven feet water to Richmond, and about the centre of the town 4| feet, where the navigation is interrupted by falls, which in a course of six miles descend about 80 feet perpendicular. A canal is nearly or quite completed for the passing of boats by these falls. Above these the river is navigable for batteaux and canoes to within 10 miles of the Blue ridge, and even through the Blue ridge a ton weight has been brought ; and the expence would not be great, when compared with its object, to open a tolerable navigation up Jackson's river and Carpenter's creek, to within 25 miles of Howard's creek of Green Briar, both of which have then water enough to float vessels into the Great Kanhaway. In some future state of population, it is possible that its navigation may also be made to interlock with that of the Patowmac ; and through that to communicate, by a short portage, with the Ohio.]

Jamunda. This lake is formed by the waters of that river, by those of the river Trombefas and others, in the territory of the Sarnundases Indians ; is large, and empties itself, by two arms, into the grand river Maraiion, forming the large island of Maravia. 
Jamunoa, another, a small river in the province and government of Antioquia of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada. It runs n. n. e. and enters the Cauca. 

==[[Janeiro|JANEIRO]]==, a province and captainship of the kingdom of Brazil ; one of the 14 which compose the same : bounded n. by the province of Espiritu Santo, e. by the Atlantic or Brazilian sea, w. by the unknown country of the infidel Indians, and 5. by the captainship of San Vicente. This province is one of the three governments into which the Portuguese have divided Brazil ; and that which is most lucrative, as being extremely fertile, especially in sugarcanes, one of the principal branches of its commerce. It has many mines of the richest gold, which are worked to great profit. It is watered by the river of its name, which is (he largest, and by 17 others, which are as follows : Carahi, Goaxindiba, Guarabi, Guapemerin, 
Magemerin, Suruhi, 
Magoa, Mereti, 
Iraja, Macacu, 
Boassu, Magegasu, 
Guapeguasu, Neumerin,

Goaguasu, 
On its coast are the islands of Ancora, Santa Ana, and Isla Grande. The principal towns are the cities of Angra del Bey, San Salvador, Cabo Frio, and the towns of Concepcion and Ubartiba.  S17  
The capital is the city of the same name, with the dedicatory title of San Sebastian ; founded by the governor, General Mendo de Sa, after the second time that the French were routed from that bay, in 1561. It is the head of a bishopric, erected by Pope Innocent XI. in 1676. Its first bishop was Don Fr. Manuel Pereyra, of the order of S. Domingo, who renounced the office as soon as consecrated ; when there was nominated in his place D. Joseph de Barros y Alarcon, who was the first that resided here. It has magnificent buildings ; amongst the most conspicuous of which are the cathedral, the college Avhich belonged to the Jesuits, for 50 persons, and founded by Don Sebastian, and the monastery of the monks of St. Benedict. There are in this city two parishes, entitled S.Joseph and Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria, a house of Misericordia, a convent of the Carmelites, the churches of Santa Cruz, of Nuestra Senora del Rosario, of La Gloria, of El Parto, and of La Concepcion, which was an house of entertainment of the French, and which is close to the Episcopal palace. The streets are wide, clean, and handsome. It abounds in garden herbs, pulse, plants, fruits, and flowers of Portugal ; and with these the markets are filled daily. In the vicinities are numerous gardens and orchards, and in its district are numbered upwards of 100 sugarengines, whilst there are others which are made no use of, and are abandoned for the more profitable speculations of the gold mines. In the fields is an incredible multitude of large and small cattle, especially in the part called Itacaces ; where they make delicate cheese, very similar to that of the province of Alentejo in Portugal. The water by which the city is provided comes from the river called Carioca, which, running from between the mountains and rocks, passes at about a league's distance ; from whence it is brought by an aqueduct, made by Governor Aires de Saldanhua y Alburquerque, in 1718. It is the city of the greatest commerce of any in Brazil ; and every year a fleet richly laden leaves its port for Portugal ; [but which has now discontiued to sail.] It has a mint, the money coined in which is much esteemed in Europe for the purity and quality of the gold. The bay or port has at its entrance a bar ; at the extremes of which rise two rocks. This bay is 24 leagues in length, and eight in width : in it are many islands, some cultivated and having sugarengines, and the most celebrated of them being that called De Cobras, off which the ships cast anchor. 
On the opposite side of the city, a natural wall of rocks extends itself as far as the sea, which  
I       Hi  

JANEIRO.  rocks they call Los Organos, and they are of different heights, forming a perfect line of defence, Independently of the fortresses, •which are arranged as follows. At the beginning and point of the bar is the fort of San Teodosio, which defends the shore in that part ; the next is the fortress of San Juan, which is an halfhexagon on the sea side, and having a wall along the land side, well furnished with artillery, also being one of the beacons which narrow the mouth of the bay. By the city is the castle of Santiago, of a circular figure, with a great tower in the middle. On the opposite side, which is that towards the n. there is, at the extremity of the bar, the fort of Nuestra Senora de Guia, which defends the strand of the said bar. In the interior is the fortress of Santa Cruz, which is the other beacon at the entrance, and stands fronting the fort San Juan, with which it commands the narrow pass : this latter fortress is also of a round figure, with much heavy artillery ; commanded by a corporal, and garrisoned by a company of soldiers. Within the bay, and opposite the mouth of the bar, in the island of Villagagnon, thus called by Nicolas'Villagagnon, a Frenchman, is another fort of the same name ; and in another island fronting this, called De las Cobras, is the fort of Gravata. At the narrow part of the entrance, upon a rock of 50 yards long and 25 wide, another fortress was begun to be erected by General Francisco de Tavora. At the foot of the castle of Santiago runs a line of wall, terminating at the gates of the city : also, on an eminence which commands the city, are the castle of the glorious martyr S. Sebastian, and the powder magazine ; and the fortification terminates with another fort behind the monastery of San Benito. 
The population of this capital consists of 10,000 inhabitants, and two regiments of infantry, who garrison it. The French, commanded by. Nicolas de Villagagnon, took possession of, and established themselves in it in 1555, but were dislodged by the Portuguese in 1558; and although they, in 1581, attempted for the second x time its conquest, they did not succeed.

Observations' on winds and currents in crossing the Atlantic: island of Frio ; harbour of Rio de Janeiro. 1. Present state, inhabitants, manners and cus-  toms. — The captainship of Rio de Janeiro includes at present the districts St. Esprit, Cabofrio, and S. Paraiba, originally granted to different individuals, but which have been since reannexed to the lands belonging to the crown. Owing to the late revolutions in the parent country, the seat of the Portuguese government has been transferred to this place. It should appear too that its court forms the most prominent feature on the political canvas of the New World ; and it is everi asserted in those parts, that the object of this court was to enlarge its own dominions by the annexation of the whole territory n. of the river Ln. Plata. 
Some of the houses of Janeiro are built of hewn stone, and others of brick, all of them being covered with tolerably fine slate, and furnished with a balcony, surrounded with lattices. The streets are generally straight, well paved, and have excellent footpaths. Most of them are terminated by a chapel, whither the people flock every evening to offer up their devotions. The ceremonies of religion are multiplied beyond example in this city, where, throughout the day, bells and sometimes skyrockets announce, at every hour, the performance of some ceremony in the churches ; and after sunset the streets of this capital are constantly crowded with religious processions. 
There are no public buildings in this city particularly deserving of attention, except the mint. The churches are all gloomy, and loaded with ornaments executed without taste. 
An aqueduct of considerable length supplies the inhabitants with water. It is carried over the valleys by a double row of arches, one placed above another, and proves highly ornamental to the city. In the squares and public places fountains are erected, whicli are attended by a guard to regulate the distribution of the water, as it is not sufficiently abundant for the wants of the inhabitants ; and people frequently are seen waiting a long time with buckets before they receive their allotted quantity. A certain portion of the water from the fountain on the quay, opposite the palace, is appropriated to the use of the shipping, and is conveyed to the casks, which remain in the boats, by means of a woollen or canvas tube, called a hose, stretching from the fountain to the cask. 
Captain Cook found this water did not remain long sweet at sea ; but his opinion probably resulted from some extraneous matters having been accidentally suffered to remain in the casks, or from some other circumstance, as other mariners affirm that it keeps better during long voyages than any other. The quay above mentioned is extremely spacious, and, as well as several of the]  

JANEIRO.  [houses/ built of granite, a material which is found in abundance on the spot. The high conical rocks at the entrance of the harbour are all of granite, and contain a large proportion of feldspar. On the s.w. side of the harbour, a very high rock particularly attracts the attention of strangers. It is composed of columnar masses, resembling basaltes, resting on a clayey bottom ; and indeed all the granitic quarries in this neighbourhood are incumbent on clay and sand. 
As this city, previous to the late political changes in Europe, was the principal depot of the riches which flowed from Brazil to Portugal, and the harbour to which the fleets destined to supply this part of the New World with European commodities proceeded, it may easily be conceived that the morals of the inhabitants of this commercial city must be similar to those of other opulent capitals ; and in fact, indolence, dishonesty, a spirit of revenge, and excesses of every kind, are not unfrequent among the great body of the people, while the higher orders indulge in every luxury which wealth can procure. The men are accused of yielding to the indulgence of depraved and unnatural appetites, and the ladies of abandoning that modesty and reserve which prove the chief ornament of the female character. This censure may perhaps in some degree originate from the singular custom which prevails among the ladies in this city, of exchanging bunches of flowers, which they carry in their hands, with those gentlemen, though total strangers, whom they chance to meet in the streets. They are also in the habit, when seated in the balconies surrounding their houses, either alone or attended by their slaves, to throw flowers on any one passing beneath, whom caprice or a transient liking lead them to distinguish. Doubtless more intimate connections frequently result from this custom ; yet it would be unfair to conclude from it, that a spirit of intrigue is universal among the Portuguese ladies of Janeiro. It is well known that in Lisbon the ladies amuse themselves on particular days, termed days of intrusion, by throwing nosegays from their balconies at the passengers ; and it has been probably in imitation of their manners, that this practice has been adopted by the females in this New "World. 
Many of these females have fine dark eyes, and animated countenances. They generally have the head uncovered, and wear their hair hanging down in tresses, tied with ribbands, and ornamented with flowers. They are regular in their attendance in the churches both at matins and ves-  pers ; and during the rest of the day they generally remain seated at their windows. In the evening they amuse themselves by playing on the harpsichord or guitar, when the doors and windows are thrown open to admit the fresh breeze; and if a stranger happen to pass at this time, and stop to listen to the music, it is not unusual for the father, husband, or brother of the fair musician, politely to invite him to enter the house. 
The men, even of the lowest order, are usually covered with cloaks when they go abroad ; and the middling and higher ranks never appear in public without swords. Both sexes are fond of operas, plays, and masquerades. They also frequent a public garden, situated by the seaside, near the extremity of the city. This garden is laid out in grassplots, shrubberries, and parterres, interspersed with trees, whose luxuriant foliage affords a refreshing shade from the rays of the In alcoves or bowers of wooden framework,  sun.  painted green, and adorned with a profusion of the most beautiful and odoriferous plants of tropical climates, the fashionable parties of Janeiro repose after the fatigue of their evening Avalks. During the dry season these alcoves are generally filled with company, who partake of an elegant supper, according to the Portuguese fashion, during which they are entertained with music, and sometimes fireworks ; and they often protract their amusements to an early hour on the following morning. In the middle of this garden stands a large fountain of artificial rockwork, adorned with figures of two alligators of tolerable sculpture, which throw water from their mouths into a marble bason. In this reservoir aquatic birds, well executed in bronze, appear to be sporting on the surface of the water. 
At a short distance from this fountain the eye is disgusted with a representation, in copper, painted green, of the papaj/e tree, which is indigenous to the climate, and of the most rapid growth. Yet this absurd caricature of one of nature's most beautiful productions, was constructed at considerable expence and labour. 
On the side of this garden, towards the sea, there is a handsome terrace of granite, near the middle of which another fountain has been constructed. It is surmounted by the statue of a little boy, holding in one hand a bird, from whose bill the water gushes into a basin underneath, while with his other hand he displays a label with the following incription : Sou ulil ainda brincando — I am useful even in my sport. 
At the extremities of this terrace stand two neat]    
T-  JANEIRO.  
[square buildings, similar to our English summerhouses. The walls of the one are covered with paintings, representing views of the harbour, and of the whale fishery, which was carried on within it till the increased number of ships annually resorting thither, so terrified these animals, that they have at length wholly forsaken it. The ceiling is of shell work, forming various designs, and the cornice, which is of the same material, exhibits several species of fish peculiar to the coast of Brazil, well executed, and displaying their natural shades and colours. 
The ceiling of the other building is composed of devices wrought in feathers, and the cornices are decorated with representations of some of the most beautiful tropical birds, elegantly arrayed in their natural plumage. The walls are covered with several large paintings, which, though extremely ill executed, yet display the chief productions from which the country derives its opulence. They include views of the gold and diamond mines, of the method in which they are wrought, and in which the precious materials are separated from the earth in which they were originally imbedded. They likewise represent the culture of the sugarcane, with the various processes for extracting its juice, and granulating it into sugar; the mode of collecting the small animals which produce the cochineal, and from which the rich and brilliant dye is prepared ; the culture of the manioc, with the means employed in making cassava and tapioca; they also depict the culture and preparation of coffee, rice, and indigo. In this garden, which is termed the passao publico, are exhibited spectacles for the entertainment of the people ; and its object to promote the health and pleasure of the inhabitants is expressed on two granitic columns, on one of which is engraven the words, A saude do Rio; and on the other, O amor do publico. 
The profit to the Portuguese at Janeiro, from the cochineal, is inconsiderable, owing to an error in the preparation. Twice or thrice a week, the slaves appropriated to this employment go among the cactus plants, and pick off carefully, with a bamboo twig shaped somewhat into the form of a pen, every fullgrown insect they can find, with many not yet arrived to their perfect state ; the consequence of which is, that the plants are never half stocked with insects, many of the females being destroyed before they had deposited their young. The natives of Mexico pursue a method very different. As soon as the periodical rains are over, and the weather is warmer, as well as drier, they fix, on the prickles of the cactus leaves, small  parcels of the finest moss, serving as nests to contain, each, ten or a dozen fullgrown female insects : these, in the course of a few days, bring forth an innumerable tribe of young, spreading themselves over the leaves and branches of the plant, till they become attached to those spots which they find most favourable for supplying nutritious juice; where, soon acquiring their full growth, they remain motionless, and then are gathered off for use ; a sufficient number being always left for the production of new broods. The insects are soon converted into cochineal by a process which, though simple, seems extremely cruel. The insects, which were collected in a wooden bowl, are thickly spread upon a flat dish of earthenware, and placed alive over a charcoal fire, where they are slowly roasted until the downy covering disappears, and the aqueous juices of the animal are totally evaporated. During this operation the insects are constantly stirred about with a tin ladle; and sometimes water is sprinkled upon them, to prevent absolute torrefaction, which would destroy the colour, and reduce them to a coal ; but a little habit teaches when to remove them from the fire. They then appear like so many dark round reddish grains, and take the name of cochineal, preserving so little of the original form of the insect, that this precious dye was long known and sought in Europe, before naturalists had determined whether it was an animal, vegetable, or mineral substance. The garden at Janeiro does not annually produce above thirty pounds weight of this commodity; though by proper treatment, from the same number of plants, ten times the quantity might be obtained. At Marica and Saquarima, both places contiguous to cape Frio, are considerable plantations of the cactus, which are propagated easily from cuttings set into the earth during the cold and rainy season, though they afterwards thrive least where excluded from the sun. The insects breed and are collected in dry weather, from October until March. The preparation of cochineal is encouraged by the trade being laid open, which had formerly been a monopoly of the crown. 
In Janeiro, not only science, but literature of every kind, is neglected ; as a proof of which, it is only necessary to mention, that in this large and opulent city there are but two or three booksellers' shops, and that these contain little besides a few obsolete works on theology and medicine. Neither do we meet with any cabinets of natural history. There is, however, a professed collector of birds and insects ; but among his collection, are]  

JANEIRO.  [Tew articles that may not be found in the cabinets of Europe. Though literature and science are yet in their infancy in this extensive country, the Native powers of the human mind have of late beorun to untold themselves. 
2. Population. — The population of Janeiro is computed at 43,000 souls, of which 40,000 are blacks, including such as have been emancipated, and the remaining 3000, whites. Few of the native Brazilians are to be found in this city ; some of their children have been taken into Portuguese families, but they constantly evince a desire to return to the habits of savage life. These people arc seldom employed except as boatrowers, in which capacity they display uncommon dexterity. They appear to entertain an hereditary antipathy to the conquerors of their country, and shun, as much as possible, the settlements of the Portuguese. A considerable part of the coast, between Janeiro and Baliia, is still inhabited by them, which prevents a regular communication, by land, between these districts, since they attack individuals without remorse, whenever they find them scattered or unprotected. 
Ease and comfort are displayed in the external appearance of the inhabitants of Janeiro ; their houses are large, commodious, and some of them superbly furnished. 
Most of the menial offices are performed by slaves, who, in this capital, have little appearance of wretchedness, when compared with those upon the plantations, who suffer under cruel and severe taskmasters. They appear to possess a gay and lively temper, and are extremely fond of dancing and music. It is very common to see the black drivers of hackney carriages at Janeiro, in the intervals of employment, amusing themselves by playing on some musical instrument, most commonly a guitar. All classes of society, indeed, in this city, display an unbounded propensity to mirth and pleasure; nor does their religion, though abounding in ceremonies, impart any thing like gloom or austerity to their manners. 
There are at this period three religious establishments for men, and two for women, in this capital ; hut neither the holy fathers, nor the nuns, manifest the smallest tendency to run into any selfdenying excess of devotion. The ladies, in particular, appear without hesitation, or restraint, at the grates, and converse freely with those strangers whom curiosity may lead to visit their convents. 
3. Commerce and agriculture. — Janeiro, as might be expected from its commercial undertakings, has been greatly improved and enlarged within these last few years. Its population has 

YOL. II.  also proportionally increased, and every thin"- indicates the thriving condition of the place. The shops are filled not only with such British manufactures as contribute to the comfort of the inhabitants, but also with those that administer to their luxury or pride. The markets are well stored with provisions, and the magazines with merchandise of every kind. The city is gradually extending, by the erection of public and private buildings ; and the merchants and tradesmen of every description appear to be busily employed. 
Besides the manufacture of cochineal, which we mentioned, when speaking of the botanical garden, there is a very considerable one, ofadifterent kind, carried on within the harbour, belonging to an exclusive company, which paj's onefifth of its profits to the crown. The fat or blubber of the large black whale, (balenaphj/salus), which formerly frequented this harbour, but which is now caught near the island of St. Catherine, and on other parts of the coast, is here converted into oil. The whalebone, which is prepared from the cartilages of the jaw of this animal, is also cleansed and separated here, before being shipped for Europe. The whalefishery, as well as that of the cazelote, (physeter cotodon), which is at present chiefly confined to the bar of the island of St. Catherine, and the bay of All Saints, might be extended with much profit and advantage to all the coast, as well as to the high seas of Brazil and cape Verde. The Dutch found the whalefishcrv extremely profitable. In 1697, they gained by it more than 2,000,000 of florins; and though, in other years, it was not equally productive, yet on the whole it yielded them a very laroe revenue. 
Other nations also avail themselves of the whales of those seas. The white whale (physeter macrocephalus) affords a still more lucrative branch of commerce. It is no unusual thing for an English whaler, from the S. seas, to put in at Janeiro for refreshments, having on board 69 whales, each Avorth at an average 200/. Sometimes a sinole whale is of such an enormous size as to fetch 1000/. 
Other species offish, frequenting the shores of Brazil, might likewise be converted to use, such as the hippopotamus, or seahorse of Angola. From the mermaid, (trichechus manatus), might be extracted great quantities of a coarse kind of oil, fit for burning and other purposes. The disagreeable smell of this oil might be corrected at a small expence, by repeated washing. 
Were the Portuguese government in Brazil t4 extend their fisheries on the coasts of the Azores] 
T T   

JANEIRO.  
[and Madeira, and to establish a regular fishery at cape Verde, similar to those of other nations, they might not only supply a sufficiency of dry fish for internal consumption, but likewise have large quantities to exchange with their neighbours for articles of which they stand in need. 
Notwithstanding the discouragements, jealousies, and exactions of the mother country, a spirit of enterprise appears to have been gradually gaining ground for these few last years in Brazil. Even the inveterate prejudices of the Portuguese nobles against trade have, in a great measure, yielded to the increasing liberality of the times ; and several of them are now concerned in the different manufactures lately established in Janeiro. One gentleman of high rank has erected a ricework in this city, in which he employs near 100 slaves, in preparing the grain for use. There is nothing in the method employed in this work particularly deserving of attention, except the use of siliceous sand, the small sharp angles of which materially assist in freeing the grain from the husks which adhere to it. The sand is afterwards separated from the grain by means of sieves, sufficiently wide to suffer it to pass through, while they letain the rice. 
The mechanical arts have not yet attained much perfection in Janeiro, though more attention daily begins to be paid to such pursuits. The cornmill, in general use here, is of a very simple construction. One which is erected on a stream near the town consists of a wheel, only a few feet in diameter, placed horizontally below the current of the water, which falls from a considerable height into hollows, obliquely cut out in the superior rim of the wheel, and impel it to a rapid rotatory motion, while its upright shaft, passing through the centre of an immoveable millstone above the wheel, but of a narrow diameter, is fixed to a smaller millstone, which being forced round with the motion of the wheel and dependent shaft, bruises between it and the stone underneath the grain, which is insinuated between them from a hopper. 
But whatever may be the rising prosperity, or increasing riches of Janeiro, it is with pain that we behold this city disgraced by an establishment originating in the sufferings and misfortunes of an unoffending race of our fellowmen. We speak of the warehouses erected at Val Longo, not far from the town, for the reception of slaves, who are imported chiefly from Angola and Benguela, on the African coast. Here these unfortunate beings are prepared for market, like so many herds of cattle. Every art is employed that cupidity can  invent to conceal their defects, and render then sleek and saleable: they are washed, anointed and fattened like stalled bullocks. About 5000 o these wretched beings, amounting to nearly i fourth of the number annually imported int< Brazil, are every year sold in the market o Janeiro. 
Agriculture, as might have been expected, ha made little progress in this country. In tlsi vicinity of Janeiro, the soil is chiefly cultivatec for raising vegetables for the whites, and rice manioc, maize, &c. for the blacks. The road are so extremely bad as only to be passable fo carriages a few miles beyond the city. The neigh bouring forests abound in trees, many of whicl are unknown to botanists, and which might provi of great value in the construction of ships, houses and for other purposes. Palms and mastic wood as well as mango and gaoyava trees, are hen also extremely common ; and besides the dyeini woods already known, there are many others which, on being submitted to a chemical exami nation, yield lakes of different colours : from on< was extracted, in the chemical laboratory of Ajuda near Lisbon, a beautiful rose colour that is mon permanentthan that of the Brazil wood. To the w of the city, at the extremity of an extensive forest, ii situated the rich and fertile valley of Tijouca. I is surrounded on all sides by lofty mountains, ex cepting towards the s. where, through a smal opening, is admitted a branch or arm of the sea But the principal ornament of this delightful spo is a clear stream, which, falling down a steep anc broad granite rock, forms a magnificent cascade whence it meanders through the valley beneath The temperature, on account of its confined situa< tion, is extremely hot and oppressive ; and th< heat is augmented by the reflection of the sun'; rays from the sides of the mountains, which are ii many places bare and rocky. In the plantation of Tijouca we meet with indigo, manioc, coffee cocoa, or chocolate trees, sugarcanes, plantains and orange and lime trees, all growing promis cuously in the greatest luxuriance, though cofFei and indigo appear to be the chief objects of atlen tion. 
Several districts in the government of Janein produce cotton, sugar, coffee, cocoa, rice, pepper and tobacco, in great abundance. That of Ri< Grande yields plenty of excellent wheat, which ii also found to grow in other parts of Brazil, witl an increase far beyond what is known in Europe The vine likewise attains to great perfection h this climate ; but the grape is not suffered to b< pressed, lest it might interfere with the sale of the"   JANEIRO.  [Portugal wines. The ipecacuanha plant, the root of which has been so long used as a valuable article in medicine, grows in great profusion near St. Catharine's, in the government of Rio, as well as a variety of other medicinal plants, some of which have been exported to Europe, while others are but very little known. 
The commodities from the captainships of St. Vicente, Espiritu Santo, and Porto Seguro, are transmitted to Janeiro, and thence shipped for Europe. These exports consist chiefly of gold, diamonds, precious stones of various kinds, tobacco, indigo, coffee, rice, cocoa, maize, sugar, honey, wax, balsam capivi, ipecacuanha, cinnamon, long pepper, ginger, dyeing Avoods, cochineal, ambergris, wood for inlaying and other purposes, various rich drugs, and perfumes. Besides these, they also export hides, trainoil, and whalebone. 
Among the articles sent from Portugal in return, the following are the principal ; woollens, linens, stuffs, gold and silver lace, dried fish, hams, sausages, haggesses, pilchards, cheese, butter, biscuits, cakes, wine, oil, vinegar, vermicelli, macaroni, bay leaves, walnuts, peeled chesnuts, dried plumbs, olives, onions, garlic, rosemary, and giass ware of every kind, manufactured at Marinha. The duties which the agents of the Portuguese government levied on the importation of goods from Lisbon and Oporto, at Rio de Janeiro, were 12 per cent, upon the value of each article. The chief duties paid at Lisbon on the commodities of the Brazils were as follows : on gold, one per cent. ; coffee, eight per cent. ; sugar, rice, and skins, ten per cent. ; indigo, 12 per cent. ; and on rum, four dollars on every pipe of 180 gallons. Brazil Avood and timber fit for shipbuilding were claimed as the property of the crown. Onefifth of the gold extracted from the mines was also exacted by the government ; and when any diamonds happen to be found in a gold mine, it was no longer suffered to be wrought for that metal, all diamond mines being seized as exclusively belonging to the crown. 
4. Mines, diamond and others. — Formerly Bahia de Todos Santos, or the bay of All Saints, was the principal seat of the government, and chief mart of the commerce of Brazil ; but the discovery of the gold and diamond mines, within a short distance of Rio de Janeiro, and communicating directly with it, has given a decided superiority to the latter. The manner in which the former of these were discovered, is differently related ; but the most common account is, that the Indians on the back of the Portuguese settlements  were observed to make use of gold for their fishhooks ; and inquiry being made as to their manner of procuring this metal, it appeared that considerable quantities of it were annually washed from the mountains, and left among the gravel and sand that remained in the valleys, after the running off or evaporation of the water. 
From the time of this discovery, considerable quantities of gold were imported into Europe from Brazil ; and these imports have gradually augmented, since new mines have been wrought in many of the other provinces. 
The extraction of this precious metal is neither very laborious, nor attended with the smallest danger, in this part of theNewWorld. The purest sort is generally found near the surface of the soil, though" it is sometimes necessary to dig for it to the depth of three or four fathoms. It is usually incumbent on a bed of sandy earth, termed by the natives saibro. 
Though for the most part the veins that are regular, and run in the same direction, are the richest, it has been observed that those spaces, the surface of which was most spangled with crystals, were those which furnished the greatest plenty of gold. It is found in larger pieces on the mountains and barren or stony rocks than in the valleys or on the banks of rivers. But in whatever place it may have been gathered, it is of %3\ carats on coming out of the mine, unless it be mixed with sulphur, silver, iron, or mercury ; a circumstance that rarely occurs, except at Goyas and Araes. 
Every man who discovered a mine was obliged to give notice of it to the government. If it was conceived to be of little consequence by those persons appointed to examine into its value, it was always given up to the public : but if, on the contrary, it was found to be a rich vein, the government never failed to reserve a portion of it for themselves. Another share was given to the commandant ; a third to the intendant ; and two shares were awarded to the discoverers : the remainder was divided amongst the miners of the district, in proportion to their circumstances, which were determined by the number of their slaves. The disputes to which this species of property gave rise, fell under the cognizance of the intendant, with the right of appeal from his decrees to the supreme court established at Lisbon, under the title of Council d'Outremer. 
It is said that a slender vein of this metal runs through the whole country, at about 24 feet from the surface ; but it is too thin and poor to answer the expence of digging. Gold is always however to be collected in the beds of rivers which have] t t 2   324  

JANE I R    [pursued the same course for a considerable time • and therefore to be able to divert a stream from its usual channel is esteemed an infallible source of gain. 
The employment of searching the bottoms of rivers and torrents, and washing the gold from the mud and sand, is principally performed by slaves who are chiefly Negroes, of whom the Portuguese Keep great numbers for that purpose. By a particular regulation, these slaves are obliged to furnish their master every day with the eighth part of an ounce of gold; and if by their industry or good fortune they collect a larger quantity, the surplus is considered as their own property, and they are allowed to dispose of it as they think fit: by which means some Negroes have, it is said, purchased slaves of their own, and lived in ^reat splendour; their original master having no other demand upon themlhan the daily supply of an eighth of an ounce, which amounts to about nine shillings sterling ; the Portuguese ounce being somewhat lighter than our troy ounce. 
The proprietors of the mines paid to the king of Portugal, as abovementioned, a fifth part of the gold which they extracted by operations more or less successful ; and this fifth of the gold obtained from all the mines in Brazil was estimated, at an average, to amount annually to about 300,000/. sterling: consequently the whole capital must be nearly 1,500,000/. sterling. If we add to this the gold exchanged with the Spaniards for silver, and what was privately brought to Europe without paying the duty, which amounted to 500,000/. more, the annual produce of the Brazilian mines was about 2,000,000/. sterling ; an immense sum to be found in a country which a few years ago was not known to produce a single grain. 
Among the many impediments thrown in the way of trade, may be ranked the prohibition which prevented the people of Brazil from working up the gold of their own mines. Even the tools and instruments used by the artificers for such purposes, were seized and confiscated by the strong hand of arbitrary power. 
It was only about the beginning of the last century that diamonds made a part of the exports from Brazil to Europe. These valuable stones are, like the gold, found frequently in the beds of rivers and torrents. Before they were supposed to be of any value, they were often perceived in washing the gold, and were consequently thrown away with the sand and gravel ; and numbers of large stones, that would have enriched the possessors, passed unregarded through the hands of several persons wholly ignorant of their nature. Antonio  
Rodrigues Banha suspected the value of them, and communicated his idea to Pedro d'Almeida, the governor of the country. Some of these brilliant pebbles were sent to the court of Lisbon, which, in 1730, commissioned D'Acunha, their minister in Holland, to have them examined. After repeated experiments, the artists pronounced them to be very fine diamonds. 
The diamonds found in the different districts oi Brazil are naturally set in a matrix of iron mineral, like those brought from the mines of Golconda and Visapour. Those found in the rivers appear to have been forced thither by currents from the adjacent mountains, where veins of them have been traced, and where they might be obtained at less trouble and expence than in the rivers. 
The value of these precious stones having been ascertained, the Portuguese were eager to collect them ; and in 1731, 1146 ounces were brought to the mother country by the fleet from Rio de Janeiro. This immense influx considerably lessened the price of diamonds in the European market, and induced the Portuguese government to take such measures as they deemed adequate to restore them to their original value. With this view, they conferred the exclusive right of searching for diamonds on a few wealthy associates ; and in order even to restrain the avidity of the company itself, it was stipulated that it should employ no more than 600 slaves in that business. It has since been permitted to increase their number at pleasure, paying 4s. 2d. per day for each miner. 
In order to ensure the business of the chartered company, the gold mines which were worked in the neighbourhood were in general shut up ; and those who had founded their expectations of fortune upon this frequently deceitful basis, were compelled to turn their activity into some other channel. The other citizens were allowed to remain on their estates; but capital punishments were decreed by the law against those persons who should encroach upon the exclusive rights granted to the company. Since the sovereign has succeeded to the company, all the citizens are suffered to search for diamonds, but under the restriction of delivering them to the agents of the crown, at the price which it has stipulated, and on paying 20 per cent, upon this sum. 
The diamonds sent from the New to the Old World were inclosed in a casket with three locks, the keys of which were separately put into the hands of the chief members of administration; and those keys were deposited in another casket, to which was affixed the viceroy's seal. While the exclusive privilege subsisted, this precious deposit,]  

JANEIRO.  [on its arrival in Europe, was remitted to government, which, according to a settled regulation, retained the very scarce diamonds, which exceeded 20 carats, and delivered every year, for the profit of the company, to one, or to several contractors united, 40,000 carats, at prices which have successively varied. An engagement was made on one hand to receive that quantity ; and on the other, not to distribute any more ; and whatever rnioht be the produce of the mines, which necessarily varied, the contract was faithfully adhered to. 
Before the recent changes in the Portuguese oovernment, that court threw 60,000 carats of diamonds into trade, which was monopolized by a single merchant, who paid for them at the rate of about M Us.Qd. per carat, amounting in the whole to 130,000/. sterling. The contraband trade in this article is said, by persons competent to form a just estimate on the subject, to have amounted to a tenth more ; so that the produce of these mines, the riches of which have been so much boasted of, did not exceed annually 143,000/. The rough diamonds used to be purchased from the merchants in Lisbon, and other places in Portugal, by the English and Dutch, who, after cutting and polishing them with more or less perfection, disposed of what remained, after supplying the demand of their own countries, to other nations of Europe. 
In the diamond and mine districts are found, between the parasitic stones, some very imperfect amethysts and topazes ; as also sapphires and emeralds, and some fine chrysolites. Jacinths or oranites are sometimes discovered in the interstices of talc or micaceous stones : these, as well as some other precious stones, never having been subjected to a monopoly like diamonds; those who discovered them were at perfect liberty to dispose of them in the manner they deemed most conducive to their interest. 
The annual exportation of these stones from Janeiro, and some of the other ports, seldom exceeded 6250/. for which the government received a duty of one per cent, amounting in the whole to the trifling sum of 62/. 10s. sterling. Mines of iron, sulphur, antimony, tin, lead, and quicksilver, are likewise found in this and other provinces of Brazil; but the pursuit of gold has too much diverted the attention of the colonists from more useful speculations. It was long supposed that copper had been withheld by nature from this vast and fruitful region of the new hemisphere ; but later researches have shown this to be an unfounded suspicion. In Rio de Janeiro there exists  a rich and copious mine of cupreous pyrites (pyrites cupri) : one cwt. of this mineral yields 25 pounds of pure copper. Similar mines of this metal have also been discovered in Minas Geraes, and other districts. 
5. Military establishment and defence. — The military establishment, even before the Portuguese sought a refuge in Brazil, was considered sufficiently respectable to oppose any hostile attempt in the field, and consisted of two squadrons of cavalry, two regiments of artillery, six regiments of infantry, two battalions of welltrained militia, besides above 200 disciplined free Negroes ; amounting in the whole to a body of at least 10,000 men, exclusive of a numerous registered, but undisciplined militia, of whom a great proportion belongs to the city and immediate neighbourhood. 
The entrance of the harbour, which does not exceed a mile from point to point, is intersected in every direction with heavy batteries. Besides, ships, in returning their fire, would labour under the disadvantage of a swell occasioned by the bar, which runs across the outside of the mouth of the harbour. 
The fort of Santa Cruz, which is a work of considerable strength, and forms the principal defence of the harbour, is in its general height from 24 to 30 feet. It mounts 23 guns towards the sea, and 33 to the w. and e. It is situated on the low point of a smooth rock, from the body of which it is separated by a fissure, 10 or 12 feet in width. It is flanked by batteries to the e. and w. and is overlooked and protected by a regular front for musketry, which runs between the hills. The weight of the guns is carefully concealed, but from the report they are judged to be heavy pieces. 
The defence of the city of Janeiro is supposed, however, by military men, to depend chiefly on the works erected on Serpent island ; the highest part of which, looking towards the town, is nearly 80 feet above the water. Here a small square fort is constructed. This island lowers gradually on the e. side to the water's edge, and is occupied by an irregular stoneline, having occasional flanks. It has no ditch, and in some parts the stoneline is low, not being more than eight feet above the rocks. Serpent island does not exceed 300 yards in length. There are mounted on it 46 guns, 20 facing the s. and s. e. and the re-   mainder facing the opposite points. The parapetwall, lately built along the front of the town, affords a good line for musketry and light guns. 
Ships leaving Rio de Janeiro seldom find it practicable to work out of the harbour against the wind blowing from the sea ; but, in general, take]     JANEIRO.  
[advantage of the landbreeze prevailing in the morning, at which time the harbour empties itself oft he accumulation of water forced into it by the seawind during the night. This reflux is frequently more powerful than the wind. Its course is along the bays on the e. side of the shore, and it afterwards sets upon the point of Santa Cruz. Ships are sometimes carried into that part of the stream, where it runs with the greatest impetuosity, and carried directly towards the rock, which is an occurrence attended with much danger, since this rock being nearly perpendicular, ships may strike against it without their keels touching any bottom. 
6. Observations on winds and currents in crossing the Atlantic— Island of Frio— Harbour of Rio de Janeiro. — In proceeding from Europe to Brazil, navigators must be determined, in what degree of longitude it may be proper to pass the line, by the winds which prevail at different seasons of the year. When the sun is far to (he 5. of the line, the s. e. winds begin to blow in about seven degrees of n, latitude, and sometimes force ships to the 27th degree, or more, of w. longitude, before they have passed the equator. When, on the contrary, the sun is to the n. the line may be crossed in a much more e. longitude, as the winds then generally blow from the n. e. ; but on arriving at the 17th degree of latitude s. of the equator, the winds become influenced by the land of Brazil, which appears in lat. 22° 40' s. 
This land, which lies to the n. of the island of Frio, is extremely high and irregular ; its peaked hills are interspersed with white vertical streaks, which give to them, when viewed from a distance, the appearance of cascades of water. Steering in a s. direction towards Frio, a small island is very soon perceived. It is of a moderate height, and about three miles distant from the mainland of Brazil, between which and it there is a free passage. 
The island of Frio lies about s. w. eight leagues from the former ; and the shore between them appears perfectly free from danger. The land of Frio is high, and from having a hollow in the middle, has the appearance of two separate islands. The strait between Frio and the continent of Brazil is nearly a mile in breadth, and seems clear from shoals. The latitude is 32° 2' s. ; the longitude, by observation, 41° 31' 45" w. In sailing w. towards Rio de Janeiro, the shore is perceived to be covered with white sand ; the land is high and irregular, with two or three small islands situated near it. 
Some of our most experienced navigators, and  among others Captain Mackintosh, in the service, of the East-India company, recommend that ships bound to Rio de Janeiro should, after falling in with cape Frio, instead of steering along shore, shape their course between s. w. and 5. w. by w. ifor 12 or 14 leagues, as to this distance the landwind extends. The forenoons are in general calm, but almost every afternoon a fresh seabreeze sets in from the s. w. It is proper to steer, in a direct course, from hence to the small islands lying under the great inclining Sugarloaf, on the m side of the entrance into Rio harbour. 
From these small islands the wind will carry the ship to the opposite side of the harbour's mouth, where the fort of Santa Cruz is situated, and which may be approached within 50 yards, and thence safely and quickly into harbour. Captain Mackintosh adds, that in his first voyage to this place, by keeping inshore, he spent five days of very unpleasant and troublesome navigation, before he could get into the harbour ; whereas, by the method now laid down, he came the same distance in much less than 24 hours, and with great ease and satisfaction. 
Sir Erasmus Gower, who commanded the expedition to China, in 1792, observes, « that the entrance of the harbour of Rio de Janeiro will shew itself by discovering the castle or fort of Santa Cruz, and a small fortified island, called Fort Lucia, nearly abreast of it. Between these is the channel into the harbour, near a mile wide ; both shores are steep ; that of Santa Cruz is perpendicular, there being six fathoms in the wash of the sea. The narrowness of the channel causes strong tides; but as the seabreeze blows fresh, they do not impede vessels entering into the harbour. In going in, it is best to keep midchannel, or even nearer to Santa Cruz. About four milesoutside the harbour's mouth, the depth of water is 18 or 19 fathoms, which decreases gradually to eight or seven ; and this being the shallowest part, may be called the bar, which is about two miles outside the fort. The water again deepens, on approaching Santa Cruz, to 17 and 18 fathoms, nor will less be found in the fair way of the great road. Large ships may moor in shoaler water • but that depth or thereabouts is more advisable, as such a situation affords the full advantage of the seabreeze, as well as that of avoiding the insects, which are very troublesome when nearer to the shore." The Lion, which carried Erasmus Gower's flag, we are informed, anchored in 18 fathoms, the Sugarloaf bearing s. by e . half e. ; the castle of Santa Cruz s. e. by 5. ; a convent on an eminence over the 5. part of the city s. w. by w. one]  [mile and a half from the landingplace opposite the viceroy's palace. 
In no part of the world, China and Japan excepted, is there so much jealousy evinced on the approach of foreign ships, or are there so many obstacles to overcome before permission can be obtained to land, as at Brazil. The difficulties experienced in this way by Lord Anson, and some of our more early circumnavigators, appear in no respect to have diminished in later times ; since every vessel, before attempting to enter the harbour, must send a boat with an officer on board to the castle of Santa Cruz, who is thence conducted to the palace of the viceroy, in order to inform his excellency of the arrival of the ship or Beet, and the reason of its touching at this port. It is also necessary that the ship's colours should be hoisted as early as possible, unless the pratique, or visiting boat from shore, has been already on board. So strictly indeed are these regulations enforced, that even a Portuguese vessel, attempting to pass the fort, will be hailed and forced to anchor, till such time as permission be obtained for her entering the harbour. The condition, force, destination, and wants of the ship must be minutely certified by the captain ; and if these appear satisfactory, orders are issued to afford him the necessary aid ; but no part of the crew is suffered to land except at the stairs opposite the palace, and even there not without express permission. A military officer or soldier attends each person while he remains on shore ; guardboats likewise surround the vessel ; and these regulations are, if possible, more rigorously executed with regard to "mercantile vessels than even ships of war. In the inner harbour there is every conveniency for heaving down ships ; and it is here that all those vessels anchor that require repair, as well as those which are receiving or delivering out cargoes ; but the outer harbour is justly considered as the most healthy situation. This city is in lat. 22° 56' s. Long. 42° V 30" w. Variation of the compass 4° 55' to the w. of the pole. The tide flows seven hours and a half, and rises about five feet and a half perpendicular. Fahrenheit's thermometer usually stands between 70° and 86°. 
The harbour of Rio de Janeiro is one of the finest known, and indeed can scarcely be excelled for capaciousness, and the security which it affords to vessels of every description. The entrance into it from the sea is bounded, on one side, by the lofty inclining cone already mentioned, and on the other by the huge mass of granite which supports^ the castle of Santa Cruz; near the middle lies the small island on which fort Lucia is built.  32?  
Though at first narrow, it gradually widens to about three or four miles, and has an excellent muddy bottom. In several directions it branches farther than the eye can reach, and is interspersed with numerous little islands, some of which are clothed with vegetation alone, while others are covered with batteries and habitations of different, kinds. Numerous villages, farms, and plantations, divided from each other by little sandy bays, rivulets, and forests, diversify and adorn the shores of this spacious harbour; while, in the distance, the eye rests on a lofty ridge of mountains rising in various fantastic forms, and clothed with wood to their very summits.] 
Janeiro, a large and abundant river, which gives its name to the former province and city ; discovered by the Spanish pilot Juan Diaz de Solis, on the first day of the year 1516 ; on which account he called it De Enero (Of January), and "the.Portuguese, who soon after became possessed of it, retained the meaning of the name in their own language.

[==[[Jayme|JAYME]]==, San, a city of the province of Valutas and captainship of Caracas. It is but a very short time that San Jayme has had the qualification of a city, and consequently a cabildo. lis situation is more remarkable than agreeable, on account of its being near the conflux of many rivers. It stands on the s. shore of the river Guana pola, about 17 miles from its confluence with the Apure. It has nothing to defend it from the annual inundations but a sandhill, on which it is built. The inhabitants during three or four months in the year are so surrounded witli water that they can neither enter or quit their houses but in boats. The ground is sandy and dry, and offers to the cultivator no very tempting prospect. Pasture for cattle is all they obtain from it. The church is the only public building in the city, and this is perfectly in unison with the feeble resources of the inhabitants of a soil so little favoured by nature.

[==[[Jayna|JAYNA]]==, a canton, parish, and river, on the 5. side of the island of St. Domingo. The rivers Nigua and Jayna are about four leagues apart ; and between them lies an extensive and fertile plain, which was originally an abundant source of riches to the colonists. The quantity of pure gold that was dug from its cavities, its sugar, cocoa, indigo, and other plantations, paid duties to a greater amount than those now paid by all the Spanish part of the island put together. It was in this territory, and on the river Jayna, that the famous lump of gold was found, which the Spanish writers say weighed 3600 Spanish dollars ; withoutmentioningmany others of a remarkable size. The settlements Gamboa, Guayabal, Bonaventura, and Cagnabola, which last was formerly called the Whale, are very inconsiderable. The whole employment of the people is breeding of cattle, or the washing of gold sand. Indigo grows wild here. The river Jayna is not fordable ; it is crossed in canoes and skins at 250 fathoms from its mouth ; and the animals are obliged to swim across it. 
YOL. II.  
The coast lying between Jayna and St. Domingo is of rock, almost perpendicular, in general from six to 15 feet high. Opposite this coast are a number of shoals, each of about 40 fathoms wide. Towards the source of this river were the celebrated gold mines of St. Christopher's, near which Columbus erected the fort of that name. There are also rich silver mines on this river. The establishments in the plain of St. Hose, and those on the Jayna, ought to be looked upon as depending oil the city of St. Domingo. They are reckoned to contain 2000 persons ; for the most part people of colour, free and slaves.]

Jean Rabel point forms the anchorage of that name, which is good, safe, and easy to v v     330  fetch. You can anchor in 15 fathoms. Yon may go farther in as far as eight fathoms ; but it is not safe, as the water shoals suddenly, and the ground is not so clean inside. The dtbarcadaire or landing place is a very good one, even if there should be a swell ; it is under the fort, which is exceedingly well placed, and makes it a very good retreat from an enemy.

[John's, St. is the largest river in the British province of New Brunswick. From its mouth on the n. side of the bay of Fundy, to its main source, in a straight direction, is about 195 miles.

It furnishes the greatest plenty of salmon, bass, and sturgeon ; and is the common route to Quebec. About a mile above the city of St. John's is the only entrance into this river. It is about 80 or 100 yards wide, and about 400 yards in length ; called the Falls of the river. It being narrow, and a ridge of rocks running across the bottom of the channel, on which are not above 17 feet of water, it is not sufficiently spacious to discharge the fresh waters of the river above. The common tides flowing here about 20 feet, the waters of the river, at low water, are about 12 feet higher than the waters of the sea ; at high water, the waters of the sea are about five feet higher than those of the river ; so that in every tide there are two falls, one outwards and one inwards. The only time of passing with safety is at the time when the waters of the river are level with the waters of the sea, which is twice in a tide, and continues not more than 20 minutes each time. At other times it is either impassable or extremely dangerous ; resembling the passage of Hellgate near New York. The banks of this river, enriched by the annual freshets, are excellent land. About SO miles from its mouth commences a fine level country of rich intervale and meadow lands, well clothed with timber and wood, such as pine, beech, elm, maple, and walnut. It has many tributary streams, which fall into it on each side, among which are the Oromocto river, by which the Indians have a communication with Passamaquoddy ; the Nashwach and Madamkiswick, on which are rich intervales that produce all kinds of grain in the highest perfection. This noble river, in its numerous and extensive branches, waters and enriches a large tract of excellent country, a great part of which is settled and under improvement. The up-Iands, in general, are covered with a fine growth of timber, such as pine and spruce, hemlock, and hard wood, principally beech, birch, maple, and some ash. The pines on this river are the largest to be met with in British America, and afford a consi-  derable supply of masts, some from 20 to SO inches in diameter, for the British navy.]

This settlement was mostly destroyed by the British in the year 1780, who were joined by a party of Indians and others, under the command of Sir William Johnson. In this action it is asserted, that Sir William evinced a want of feeling which would have disgraced a savage. The people destroyed in this expedition were his old neighbours, with whom he had formerly lived in the habits of friendship. His estate was among them, and the inhabitants had always considered him as their friend. These unfortunate people, after seeing their houses and property consumed, were hurried, such as could walk, into cruel captivity ; those who could not, fell victims to the tomahawk and scalping knife.]

They are two, the largest being nearest the coast and four leagues long; the other, called Mas Afuera, to distinguish it, being small. The territory of the first, towards the n. part, is composed of mountains covered with trees, and amongst others, with pepper trees similar to those of Chiapa. In the s. part, which is most barren, on account of the strong winds that prevail, there are no trees, save in some glens formed by the hills ; but there is found a species of reed or straw r of an height exceeding a man's stature. There are numberless streams which rush down from the mountains, and forming various cascades, fall into the sea. The temperature is very cold. In the n, part is a port, which is the best, although not very secure, as being exposed to the n. and n. e. winds. It is 50 fathoms deep, and is in the winter almost useless, through the great risk which vessels encounter in it. Besides this there are two other smaller ports, the one to the e. the other to the w. ; but these are oidy to be made by small vessels. These islands are desert, and have nothing upon them but mountain goats, and on the strands seawolves in abundance. In the aforesaid port, however, is abundance of delicate fish of different sorts, and amongst the rest, cod very similar to that found off Newfoundland ; another fish called the tollo, having on its back a spur like ivory, which is an antidote against the toothache ; also here are found lobsters of half a yard long, of delicate flavour. The islands of Juan Fernandez have ever been a place of resort for pirates of the S. sea, where they might take in water and fuel, and provide themselves with the flesh of the goats; and to prevent this latter accommodation, the president of Chile sent hither a number of mastiffdogs, to devour and extirpate the above animals, nor without success, for these are now scarcely to be seen, whilst the dogs are found in immense packs, and have the peculiarity of never barking. A Scotchman named Alexander Selkirk, who must have been left there by some pirate, lived for five years on one of these islands, when he was taken off" by a   British ship. The same also happened to a Mosquito Indian. The English admiral George Anson staid some days in the port of this island, giving it the name of* Cumberland, after that he and aTl his crew had undergone great hardships  in doubling cape  in 1741 ; and it was  shortly afterwards visited by Don Jorge Juan, and Don Antonio de Ulloa, with two frigates. The aforesaid admiral sowed in the island various fruits and herbs for the advantage of such as might afterwards visit it. These islands are 100 leagues from the continent of Chile, and 440 n. of the cape of Horrios, in lat. 32° 40' *.

[==[[Kanhaway|KANHAWAY]]==, Great, a river of Virginia, of considerable note for the fertility of its lands, and still more as leading towards the head waters of James's river. But it is doubtful whether it* great and numerous rapids will admit a navigation, but at an expence to which it will require ages to render its inhabitants equal. The great obstacles begin at what are called the Great falls, 90 miles above the mouth, below which are only five or six rapids, and these passable with some difficulty even at low water. From the falls to the mouth of Green Briar is 100 miles. It is 280 yards wide at its mouth. The head waters of this river are in the w. part of N. Carolina, in the most e. ridge of the Alleghany or Appalachian mountains, and n. of the 36th deg. of lat. Its head branches encircle those of the Holston, from which they are separated by the Iron mountain, through which it passes 10 miles above the lend mines. About 60 miles from Little river it receives Green Briar river from the e. which is the only considerable tributary stream in all that distance. About 40 miles below the month of Green Briar river, in Virginia, in the Kanhaway, is a remarkable cataract. A large rock, a little elevated in the middle, crosses the bed of the river, over which the water shoots, and falls about 50 feet perpendicularly, except at one side, where the descent is more gradual. The Great Kanhaway is 196 miles below Pittsburgh, and is navigable most of the year; and a waggon road may be made through the mountain which occasions the falls, and by a portage of a few miles only, a communication may be had between the waters of Great Kanhaway and Ohio, and those of James's river in Virginia. Down this river great quantities of goods are conveyed up the Kentucky river, others on horseback or in waggons to the settled part, and sold, on an average, at 100 percent, advance. See Sulphur Spring.] [Kanhaway, Little, a small navigable river of Virginia, which is 150 yards wide at its mouth, and is navigable 10 miles only.

[==[[Kennebeck|KENNEBECK]]==, next to Penobscot, is the finest river in the district of Maine. Three miles from the chops, Swan island, seven miles long, divides the waters of the river. The waters on both sides of it are navigable; but the channel on the e. side of it is mostly used. Thirtyeight miles from the sea is the island Nahunkeag, which sig-   nifies the land where eels are taken. Within three miles of this island, a small river, coming w. from ponds which are in the town of Winthrop, runs into the Kennebeck, and is known by the name of Cobbeseconte, called by the Indians Cobbisseconteag, which in their language signifies the place where sturgeon are taken. Six miles further up the river we find the head of the navigable waters. This is a bason 46 miles from the sea, and Very commodious for the anchoring of vessels. On the e. bank of the small fall which terminates the navigation of the Kennebeck, is fort Western, which was erected in the year 1752. From that fort to Taconnet fall is 18 miles. This is a great fall of water, and on the bank of it, on the e. side of the river, is fort Halifax, erected in 1754, and situated on the point of land formed by the confluence of the Sebastacook with the Kennebeck, by which the latter is increased onethird in size. The Sebastacook comes from lakes nearly n. from its mouth ; and in its windings receives brooks and small rivers, for the space of 150 miles. Thirty miles above fort Halifax, as the river runs, the stream called Sandy river flows into the Kennebeck, at the point where the ancient town of Norridgewock stood : 40 miles or somewhat further up, the Kennebeck takes as.w. course. The Kennebeck turning again w. receives the e. branch 50 miles from Norridgewock. The main branch of the Kennebeck, winding into the wilderness, forms several carryingplaces, one of which, called the Great Carryingplace, is five miles across, and the river's course gives a distance of 35 miles, for that which is gained by five on the dry land. At about 100 miles distance from the mouth of the e. branch, the source of the main or w. branch of the Kennebeck is found extended a great distance along the side of the Chaudiere, which carries the waters from the high lands into the St. Lawrence. There are no lakes, but a few small ponds and morasses at the source of this branch. The carryingplace from boatable waters in it to boatable waters in the river Chaudiere, is only five miles oven The e. branch ofthe Kennebeck, which uniteswiththeother above Norridgewock, issues from a body of waters which lie n. about 20 miles from the confluence of the two branches. These waters are called Moose Pond or Moose Lake. The sides of the lake are so crooked that the body of waters has an irregular figure ; but the lake contains three times as much water as is found in lake George. There are very high mountains to the n. and w. of the lake, and from these the waters run by many channels to the St. Lawrence. The Kennebeck affords great quantities of lumber, and is inhabited at dif-  ferent seasons by several species of valuable fisb. Salmon and sturgeon are taken here in great abundance, and shad and alewives relieve the wants of the necessitous part of the inhabitants. This river forms the nearest seaport for the people on the upper part of the river Connecticut. From tiie Upper Cohos or Coos, on the latter river to the tidewater in Kennebeck, is 90 measured miles.]

[==[[Kentucky|KENTUCKY]]==, a very crooked river in the state of its name, which after a general n. w. course of 200 miles, falls into the Ohio,, in lat. 38° 20' n. It is sometimes called Cuttawa. Its source is in the Laurel mountains, and it interlocks with Licking river. Its mouth is 77 miles above the Rapids* and 626 below Pittsburg. Its mouth is 250 yards wide, and the river is navigable 130 miles; the current is considerably rapid, the banks being high and rocky. It is said blacklead mines have been found on the head waters of this river. Little Kentucky river is 25 yards wide, and three miles w. of Kentucky river.] [Kentucky, one of the United States of America, bounded n. w. by the river Ohio,^ w. by the Mississippi, s. by Tennessee state, e. by Sandy river and the Great Laurel mountains. It lies between lat. 36° 30' and 38° 45' n. and between long. 81° 50' and 89° 10' m ; about 350 miles long and 134 broad, and contains about 50,000 square miles. It is divided into 14 counties, viz. Jefferson, Fayette, Bourbon, Mercer, Nelson, Maddison, Lincoin, Woodford, Mason, Washington, Clark, Scott, Logan, and Franklin. By the census of 1810, the population of this state amounted to 406,511 souls, and by the former census to only 73,677, of whom 12,430 were slaves. In this state there are, according to Mr. Ashe, millions of acres, called barrens, altogether incapable of cultivation from want of water. Of the inhabitants of this state Mr. Ashe exhibits a very disagreeable picture; charging them with ferocity, boisterousness, and coarse debauchery. 
The river Ohio washes the n. vs. side of Kentucky, in its whole extent. Its principal branches which water this fertile tract of country, are Sandy, Licking, Kentucky, Salt, Green, and Cumberland rivers. These again branch in various directions into rivulets of different magnitudes, fertilizing the country in all its parts. The springs and streams lessen in June, and continue low, hindering navigation, until November, when the autumnal rains swell the rivers, and replenish the whole country with water. At the bottoms of these watercourses the limestone rock, which is common in this country, appears of a greyish colour; and where it is exposed to the air in its natural state, it looks like brown freestone. On the banks of these rivers and rivulets, this stone has the appearance of fine marble, being of the same texture, and is found in the greatest plenty. After heavy rains, the waters in the rivers rise between the high limestone banks from 10 to 30 feet. There are     
H  KENTUCKY.  
[five noted saltsprings or licks in this country, viz. the Higher and Lower Blue springs, the Big Bone lick, Drinnon's lick, and Bullet's lick, atSaltsburg. The last of these licks has supplied this country and Cumberland with salt, at three dolls. 33 cents. a bushel, and some is exported to the Illinois country. The method of procuring water from these licks, is by sinking wells from 30 to 40 feet deep, which yield water more strongly impregnated with salt than the water from the sea. 
This whole country, as far as has yet been dis covered, lies upon a bed of limestone, which in general is about six feet below the surface, except in the valleys, where the soil is much thinner. A tract of about 20 miles wide, along the banks of the Ohio, is hilly, broken land, interspersed with many fertile spots. The rest of the country is agreeably uneven, gently ascending and descending at no great distances. The angles of ascent are from 8° to 24°, and sometimes more. The valleys in common are very narrow, and the soil in them is very thin, and of an inferior quality ; and that along the ascending ground is frequently not much better ; for where you see a tree blown up you find the roots clinging to the upper parts of the rock. The soil on these agreeable ascents (for they cannot be called hills) is sufficiently deep, as is evident from the size of the trees. The soil is either black or tinged with a lighter or deeper vermilion, or is of the colour of dark ashes. In many places there are appearances of potter's clay, and coal in abundance. The country promises to be well supplied with wholesome welltasted water. In Nelson county, n. w. of Rolling Fork, a branch of Salt river, is a tract of about 40 miles square, mostly barren, interspersed with plains and strips of good land, which are advantageous situations for raising cattle, as the neighbouring barrens, as they are improperly styled, are covered with grass, and afford good pasturage. Thelandse. of Nolincreek,a branch of Green river, are in general of an inferior quality ; but the banks of Green river afford many desirable situations. 
Toward the head waters of Kentucky river, which interlock with the waters of Cumberland and Sandy rivers, and the whole country e. and s. as far as the Ilolston river, is broken and mountainous ; and from the description given by hunters, it has been much doubted whether it would ever be practicable to make a passable road from Kentucky across to "Winchester, in Virginia, on the e. side of the mountains, which, on a straight line, is not perhaps more than 400 miles, and the way now travelled being 600. This doubt, however, is now removed, and a company have lately  undertaken to cut a road (it is thought a waggon road may be made) from Kentucky, to pass by the Sweet springs, in Virginia ; thence to Winchester. This new road, it is supposed, will be nearly 200 miles shorter than the one now travelled. 
This country in general is well timbered. Of the natural growth which is peculiar to this country, we may reckon the sugar, the coffee, the papaw, the hackberry, and the cucumber trees. The two last are soft wood, and bear a fruit of the shape and size of a cucumber. The coffee tree resembles the black oak, and bears a pod, which encloses a seed, of which a drink is made not unlike coffee. Besides these, there is the honeylocust, black mulberry, wild cherry, of a large size; the buckeye, an exceeding soft wood, and the horsechesnut of Europe. The magnolia bears a beautiful blossom of a rich and exquisite fragrance. Such is the variety and beauty of the flowering shrubs and plants which grow spontaneously in this country, that in the proper season the wilderness appears in blossom. The accounts of the fertility of the soil in this country have, in some instances, exceeded belief, and probably have been exaggerated. That some parts of Kentucky, particularly the high grounds, are remarkably good, all accounts agree. The lands of the first rate are too richforwheat, and will produce50 and 60, and in some instances, it is affirmed, 100 bushels of good corn an acre. In common, the land will produce 30 bushels of wheat or rye an acre. Barley, oats, flax, hemp, and vegetables of all kinds common in this climate, yield abundantly. Cotton is seldom and with difficulty brought to perfection. Irish potatoes produce in abundance ; sweet potatoes are raised with difficulty. 
The old Virginia planters say, that if the climate does not prove too moist, few soils known will yield more or better tobacco. Experience has proved that the climate is not too moist. Great quantities of this article have been exported to France and Spain, through New Orleans; and it is a well known fact, that Philadelphia is a profitable market for the Kentucky planters, notwithstanding all the inconveniences and expences of reshipment at New Orleans, under a Spanish government. What advantages then may not this country expect, since the free navigation of the Mississippi is now enjoyed ? 
In the rivers are plenty of buffalo, pike, and catfish of uncommon size, salmon, mullet, rock, perch, garfish, eel, suckers, sunfish, &c. Shad have not been caught in the w. waters. 
Swamps are rare in Kentucky; and of course the reptiles which they produce, such as snakes,]  KEO  [frogs, &c. are not numerous. The honeybee may be called a domestic insect, as it is said not to be found but in civilized countries. This is confirmed by a saying which is common among the Indians, when they see a swarm of bees in the woods, " Well, brothers, it is time for us to decamp, for the white people are coming." Nevertheless, bees, of late years, have abounded, to their amazement, even 200 miles n. and n. to. of the Ohio. The quadrupeds, except the buffalo, are the same as in Virginia and the Carolinas. 
The climate is healthy and delightful, some few places in the neighbourhood of ponds and low grounds excepted. The inhabitants do not experience the extremes of heat and cold. Snow seldom falls deep, or lies long. The winter, which begins about Christmas, is never longer than three months, and is commonly but two, and is ; so mild as that cattle can subsist without fodder. 
Kentucky experiences a greater degree of temperature than any of the neighbouring states ; Fahrenheit's thermometer seldom falling below 35 deg. in winter, nor rising above 80 deg. in summer. The approach of the seasons is gradual. The summer continues mostly to the middle of October. The autumn or mild weather generally continues until Christmas, when there is some cold and frost until February, when the spring approaches ; and by the beginning of March several shrubs and trees begin to shoot forth their buds ; by the middle of the month the buckeye or horsechesnut is clad in summer's array ; and by the middle of April the foliage of the forests is completely expanded; which is a fortnight earlier than the leaves are shot forth in Virginia and Maryland : and Cumberland is proportionally more temperate than N. Carolina, as Kentucky is to Virginia. Maltliquor, spirits distilled from corn and rye, and the juice of the sugartree mixed with water, constitute the ordinary beverage of the country. Here are various minerals ; as iron, copper, lead, sulphur, nitre, &c. Ironworks are in such forwardness as to furnish large quantities of castings. 
The legislature of Virginia, while Kentucky belonged to that state, made provision for a college in it, and endowed it with very considerable landed funds. The Rev. John Todd collected, chiefly from a number of liberal gentlemen in England, a very handsome library for its use. This college, of late, has not flourished ; and another has been established, and considerable funds collected for its support. Schools are established in the several towns, and in general regularly and handsomely supported. In this state are two printing offices, 

VOL. II.  and two weekly gazettes published. There are erected a papermill, oilmills, fullingmills, sawmills, and a great number of valuable gristmills.' Several valuable tanneries have been established in different parts of the country. Their salt works are more than sufficient to supply all their inhabitants at a low price. They make considerable quantities of sugar from the sugartrees. 
The banks, or rather precipices, of Kentucky and Dick's river, are to be reckoned among the natural curiosities of this country. Here the astonished eye beholds 300 or 400 feet of solid perpendicular rock, in some parts of the limestone kind, and in others of fine white marble, curi; ously checquered with strata of astonishing regu, larity. These rivers have the appearance of deep artificial canals. Their high rocky banks are covered with red cedar groves. 
Caves have been discovered in this country of several miles in length, under a fine limestone rock, supported by curious arches and pillars. Springs that emit sulphureous matter have been found in several parts of the country. One is near a salt spring in the neighbourhood of Boonsborough. There aie three springs or ponds oi bitumen near Green river, which do not form a stream, but empty themselves into a common reservoir, and when used in lamps, answer all the purposes of the best oil. Copperas and alum are among the minerals of Kentucky. Near Lexington are found curious sepulchres full of human skeletons. It has been asserted that a man in or near Lexington, having dug five or six feet below the surface of the ground, came to a large flat stone, under which was a well of common depth, regularly and artificially stoned. 
The distance of Philadelphia, by land, to Kentucky is between 700 and 800 miles ; from Baltimore nearly 700; nearly 600 from Alexandria; and upwards of 500 from Richmond. From the rapids of the Ohio to Santa Fe, is 1000 miles, and from thence to the city of Mexico, 1500.]

==[[Kingston|KINGSTON]]==, a city, the capital of the island of Jamaica, one of the Antilles ; situate n. of the bay of Port Royal, and at the present day a parish and head of the district, although it formerly belonged to San Andres : founded in 1692-, according to a plan drawn by Colonel Lilly, after the great earthquake, which destroyed Port Royal. It is of a very beautiful plant, and contains about 12,000 houses well built and divided into plots. The streets are wide, and cut at right angles. It is the residence of the principal merchants of the island, is a mile and an half long, and about the same wide. The number of inhabitants is 11,000, amongst which we count 5000 Negro slaves, and 1200 Negro and Mulatto bondsmen. [Other accounts say, that in 1788, the white inhabitants amounted to 6539; free people of colour 3280 j and slaves 16,659 ; in all 26,478.] It is a town of great commerce, and there are never fewer vessels in its bay than 200; so that it is in fair competition on this score with Port Royal. The bay of Kingston was fortified at great expence by Admiral Charles Knowles, the governor of the island, and is capable of containing a thousand ships, which may lie very close to the land ; but the peninsula which protects it from the sea is so low and narrow that they are not secure in tempests. There are established for the defence of this city 10 companies of infantry and two of horse, amounting in the whole to about 1000 men. It has a Protestant church, two Jewish synagogues, and a Quakers meetinghouse, and it used to send three deputies to the assembly. Besides the ordinary tribunal of justice, which sits every two months, there are resident a receivergeneral, a commandant of marine, a secretary, and a superintendaht. By the list of vessels which for 20 years have left its port, we have the average of 400 annually. In 1722, it suffered much from an hurricane, which was extremely furious, and lasted from eight in the morning till 10 at night, destroying half the houses; and it has since experienced many others, though not of equal violence. It is z z 2    356  five miles by sea from Puerto Real, but by land 15, and by very bad roads; 11 miles from Spanishtown, half of which way it is necessary to make by land, and the other half by sea ; and is in lat. 17° 59' 30" n.

These missionaries, penetrating through the mountainous parts of this country in the 16th century, discovered these Indians, and instructed them in the faith, domesticating them and reducing them to settlements. Afterwards the bishop of Truxillo appointed amongst them a secular curate, who not being able to accommodate himself to the solitude of the country so immense, and to the difficulty of providing necessaries, besought that prelate, who was then Seiior Paravicini, that he would permit the Jesuits to have the charge of these souls ; a system which was acceded to by the viceroy of Peru, who also nominates for their government a corregidor. The confines of this province are in all parts mountainous and woody, as is its territory. The climate is hot and very moist, and its productions are maize, roots, and all the other trees found on the mountains, such as plantains, pines, guayabas, lemons, &c. Here also are monkeys, the flesh of some of which are eaten by the Indians, and of others not, parrots, guacamayos, pigs, and various other mountain animals ■ nor is it wanting in an abundance of snakes, vipers, and venomous insects. The natives cultivate much cotton, and the province is irrigated by some rivers, the chief of which is Moyobamba, which passes through the middle of it, and in its midcourse receives a great supply of waters from the river Negro, from the Huambos and others ; and which at the end of the province unites itself with a river which flows from Guanuco, also large, and takes the name of Huallagua ; when, running to n. e. for 20 leagues, it enters the Maranon, first passing by the settlement named La Laguna, of the province of Mainas.

Lamas, the settlement and aforesaid capital of the province, is of an hot climate, and the place where the Quechuan language is spoken in its greatest purity. In lat. 7° 5' s.

It is beautifully situate, fertile, and of good temperature. It was first founded one league from the sea, and was since removed to the distance of two, in a llanura watered by the river of its name, and by which passes the road leading from Piura to Lima. In its church, which is very beautiful, are four curacies, Avith as many branches or chapels of ease, the which are called San Pedro, Santa Rosa, and San Roque, to administer the sacraments to the Indians. Its territory is very fertile in fruits and vines, of which some wine is made. The poor people maintain themselves by making coverlets, mantles, and other cotton garments.

==[[Lampa|LAMPA]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru; bounded n. by the province of Carabaya, e. by that of Asangaro, s. by that of Paucarcolla, and in some degree by the lake of Chucuito, s. e. by the province of Moquegua, and w. by that of Arequipa. It is 30 leagues long from n. to s. and 20 wide. Its temperature is very cold, as being situate, the greater part, in the midst of the Cordilleras Nevadas, covered with snow the whole year; and notwithstanding that it has many llanos or pampas, yet these lie so exposed And lofty as to be of much the same coldness as the other parts. Thus we find this province produces no other fruits than the bitter papas, of which is made chi/no, and another little seed like millet, and some bark ; being obliged to furnish itself with the rest from the other provinces, and giving in exchange large and small cattle. Here breed sheep of the country, vicunas and vizcachas, and from their wools are made many coverlets and carpets, in which, as well as in lambskins, the natives frequently pay their tribute, as also their bulls and parochial tithes. At each shearing, 70 arrobas of wool is procured from every thousand sheep, and are sold at seven reals each ; when they are carried to the manufactories at Quispicanchi and elsewhere. A great emolument is also derived here from the tallow of the animals when killed, since, at every slaughter of 100 sheep, they regularly procure from four to five quintals, which are sold at 10 dollars : again, the meat being hardened by frost, and called chalona, will fetch four reals. These are the articles of its commerce; for, although it has some mines, yet the metal is of base alloy, and scarcely any one gives himself the pains to work them ; not, however, that it is without certain mills for grinding metals, which are worked to from 10 to 12 marks each caxon, but that the expences are excessive. Metals are also extracted from the ancient mine of Vilavila, and formerly from other mines, in great abundance ; so as, with all the above drawbacks, to yield 15,000 marks of silver. Towards the n. of the province is a very lofty mountain, called Caquenquerafiani, in which was foiind a rich vein of quicksilver, formerly worked; and near to it is a lake of three leagues in circumference, and abounding with tortora (reed), amongst which breed rabbits, turtledoves, pigeons, cuyes y deer, and halcyons.

The whole of this province is full of chasms and ravines, and it extends from n. to 5. as far as the mountainous countries of the infidels, where it becomes very wide. It has a quantity of streams, which form one large river, the which passing through the mountains, runs to unite its waters with the Beni. It is 36 leagues long, and 10 wide. Its territory is very unequal ; and although the mountains and ravines are generally covered with snow the whole year, the settlements are not only healthy, but the temperature mild.

In some parts are breeds of cattle of every species ; and in the district of Quebaya, and in other places, are various gold mines, which were formerly very productive, but now scarcely worked, more from want of resolution and means of paying the expences of labour, than from any scarcity of metal; not but that considerable profit is, nevertheless, derived from these mines.

[==[[Latacunga|LATACUNGA]]==, Asiento of, the first jurisdiction to the s. of that of Quito in Peru. The word asiento implies a place less than a town, but larger than a village. It stands on a wide plain, having on its e. side the e. cordillera of the Andes, from which projects a very high mountain ; and at a small distance from its foot is situated Latacunga. On its w. side is a river, which is sometimes fordable, but generally passed over by a bridge. This asiento is large and regular, the streets broad and straight, the houses of stone, arched and well contrived, one story high. This precaution the inhabitants were taught to observe by a dreadful    destruction of all the buildings, on the 20th of June 1699. Out of 600 stone houses, which the asiento then contained, only a part of one, and the Jesuit's church, were left standing ; the most of the inhabitants were buried in the ruins. The stone of which the houses and churches are built, is a kind of pumice, or spongy stone, ejected from volcanoes ; which have formed inexhaustible quarries in the neighbourhood. It is so light, that it will swim in the water ; and from its great porosity, the lime cements the different pieces very strongly together. This jurisdiction contains 17 principal villages. The air of the asiento is cold, from the place being only six leagues from the mountain of Cotopaxi ; which as it is little less in height or extent than those of Chimborazo and Caymburo, so, like them, it is covered with ice and snow. The villages are populous ; such, as are seated in the valleys are hot, those in the plains temperate, whilst those which border on the mountains, like that of the asiento, are cold, and sometimes to an excessive degree. The inhabitants amount to about 12,000, chiefly Spaniards and Mustees. Great quantities of pork are salted here and sent to Quito, Guayaquil, and Riobamba, being highly valued for the peculiar flavour given it in the pickling. The manufactures are those of cloth, bays, and tucuyos. The inhabitants of Pugili and Saquisili are noted for making earthen ware, highly valued all over the province of Quito. The clay of which they are made is of a lively red, remarkably fine, emitting a kind of fragrancy, and the workmanship very neat and ingenious.]

From Montreal it assumes the name of St. Lawrence, and continuing the same course passes by Quebec, and meets the tide upwards of 400 miles from the sea, and is so far navigable for large vessels. Having received in its course, besides Ottawas, St. John's, Seguina, Desprairies, Trois Rivieres, and innumerable other smaller streams, it falls into the ocean at cape Rosieres, by a mouth about 90 miles broad.

They go naked, hardly covering their waists with a mat." They carry their.cbildren on their backs in a kind of scarf. They wear ornaments in their nostrils, and have no beards.] 

==[[Lerma|LERMA]]==, a city, the capital of the alcaldia mayor in Nueva Espaiia; founded, by order of the Marquis of Guadalcazar, viceroy of that kingdom, by Don Martin Varejon, in 1613; the king having granted to it four leagues for the extent of its jurisdiction, but which has been curtailed in the present day by the encroachment of the jurisdiction of the estates of the marquisate del Valle, and of other masters of estates of the jurisdictions of Toluca and Metepec, on its boundaries ; and thus, on this account, as well as from having been deserted by many of its inhabitants, is its commerce very small, and it is in a state nearly bordering upon complete poverty. It lies in the direct road leading from Mexico to the interior provinces; on which account, for the accommodation of travellers, a large causeway was built, which traverses the city from n. to s. It is small, of an irregular plant, and the houses are in a state of dilapidation. Its temperature is cold and moist, as being situate just at the commencement of that extremely cold valley of Toluca and Metepec, which is continually covered with snow. Very near to this city runs the river called Matlazingo, which in the lowest part of the territory forms a swamp, and being replenished by various springs which rise in the country, forms a very deep body of water, at the spot where it has a bridge. The origin and source of this river is in a small spring rising near the settlement of Santiago. The city contains 95 families of Indians, 57 of Spaniards, 133 of Mustees and Mulattoes ; and produces maize and other seeds, though not in abundance, from the want of land, since in its jurisdiction, which is no more than four leagues long, and a little more than three wide, the greater part of the territory consists of mountains and ravines incapable of cultivation. It is consequently obliged to look to the neighbouring jurisdictions for a supply of all the necessaries of life, being content in the breeding some swine. This alcaldia has no more than four settlements, which are Tarasquillo, Santiago, San Mateo, and San Miguel. It is nine leagues w. s. w. of Mexico, in lat. 19° 16'. Long. 99° 21' SO" w. Lebma, a settlement of the province and go-

LlMA, a city, the capital and metropolis of the kingdom and provinces of Peru ; founded on the 6th of January, and not on the 18th, as some authors affirm, by Don Francisco Pizzaro, Marquis of Las Charcas y Atavillos, in 1535. The Emperor Charles V. gave it the title of Royal City, on the 7th of December 1537; and for arms a shield, with three crowns of gold, on an azure field, and above a star, with this motto, " Hoc Sigmtm Fere Regum est-" and for supporters, two crowned eagles, and on their heads a J and a C, initials of the name of Jane and Charles. It is also called the city of Los Reyes, (the Kings,) in memory of the day of its foundation, and to whom it was dedicated, and to which the three crowns on the shield have an allusion. It is situate in an extensive llanura, called the Valley of Rimac ; and from a corruption of the spelling we have its present name, Lima. On the n. it is washed by the river of this same name ; and over this is a beautiful stone bridge of five arches, built by order of the viceroy, the Marquis of Montes Claros. The plaza mayor is square and large; the buildings surrounding the same are magnificent, and in the midst is a large brass fountain, made with great taste, and at the order of the viceroy, the Count of Salvatierra. The episcopal palace is the loftiest and finest structure : the cathedral is of handsome architecture, and was finished building on (he 8th of December 1758. This city is of a triangular figure, and the part facing the river is twothirds of a league long. It is surrounded by a mudwall . T?  

LIMA.  with 346 balustrades, the work of the viceroy, the Duke of Palata, and executed by the engineer Peter Ramon, a Fleming, in 1685. The streets are wide, although the houses are low, to guard against mischief in earthquakes; these are, however, of comely appearance, convenient in the interior and richly adorned, having, almost all of them, gardens and orchards attached. The city is divided into five parishes, which are, ElSagrario, Santa Ana, S. Sebastian, S. Marcelo, and S. Lazaro, besides two other churches called S. Salvador and the Chapel of the Foundlings, where there is a priest, who acts also as a parish priest, and another parish of Indians in the Cercado, with the title of Santiago, administered formerly by the Jesuits. It has 19 convents of religious orders, which are named as follows : La Casa Grande, La Recoleccion de la Magdalena, the college of S. Tomas for studies, that of Santa Rosa ; three of S. Francisco, La Casa Grande, Recoletos de Nnestra Senora de los Angelos or Guadalupe, and Descalzos de S. Diego, which are in the suburbs ; three others of S. Agustin, the Casa Grande de S. Ildefonso, the college for studies, and Nuestra Senora de Guia for novices; three others of La Merced, the Casa Grande, the college of S. Pedro Nolasco, and the Recoleccion deBelen ; six which were of the Jesuits, namely, S. Pablo or Collegio Maximo, S. Martin, a college of study for seculars, S. Antonio, a house for novices; a convent with the dedicatory title of Nuestra Senora de los Dolores or Los Desamparados, the college of the Cercado, and that of La Chacarilla, a house of exercises. It has also an oratorio of the congregation of S. Felipe Neri, a monastery of Benedictine monks, with the title of Nuestra Senora de Montserrat ; a house of the fathers the Agonizantes, with that of La Buena Muerte, which Avas founded in 1715, and afterwards rebuilt, in 1736, in the suburb of S. Lazaro ; a convent of the religious minims of S. Francisco de Paula, with the title* of Nuestra Senora del Socorro ; three others, with hospitable institutes, called the one San Juan de Dios, with the title of Convalescencia, and the two others of Bethlemites, the one being called the Casa Grande, and being out of the walls of the city, and provided for the reception of convalescents, the other for incurables. Besides all the above are nine public hospitals, namely, S. Andres for the Spaniards, S. Pedro for poor ecclesiastics, Espiritu Santo for sailors, S. Bartolome for Negroes, Santa Ana for Indians, S. Pedro de Alcantaro for women, La Caridad for the same, and S. Lazaro for lepers, Here are 14 monasteries and convents of nuns, which are,  
La Encarnacion, La Concepcion, Santa Catalina, Santa Clara, La Trinidad, El Carmen, Santa Teresa or Carmen Baxo, Las Descalzas de S. Joseph, Las Capuchinas, Nazarenas, Mercenarias, Santa Rosa, Trinitarias Descalzas, and the nuns of Prado; four beaterios or houses of recluse women, namely, Santa Rosa de Viterbo, Nuestra Senora del Patrocinio, Nuestra Senora de Copacavana for Indian nobility, that of S. Joseph for women divorced from their husbands, and a house of support for poor women : all the above being a proof of the richness, magnificence, and devotion of the city. This city is also graced with an university, with the title of S. Marcos, which has produced innumerable wise men, and was founded in 1549, by the bull ofpope Pius V. when the same privileges were granted it as those enjoyed by the university of Salamanca : also by a cedule of 1572, and again by one of 1576, it was put under the royal patronage, and separated from the order of S. Domingo, being transferred to a more public spot ; and from being in a state of great dilapidation, reestablished by Philip III. on the present footing, such as to render it the first and most celebrated of all America. Here is also another royal college, founded by the viceroy Don Francisco de Toledo ; a tridentine seminary, called Of Santo Toribio, from its founder ; and a beautiful college with a house of retirement for some noble families. In this metropolis resides the viceroy, who is the president of the tribunal of the royal audience, founded in 1541, but according to other authors, in 1544; also the tribunal of the consulate of the commerce, founded in 1613. The Pontiff Paul erected it into a bishopric in 1539, and three years afterwards it was raised into an archbishopric, and in 1571, declared a metropolitan, having been previously suffragan to the archbishopric of Sevilla. Its titular was S. Juan Evangelista, to distinguish it from that of Cuzco, which has the titular of La Asuncion, the same that was given to it by Francisco PLzarro. The tribunal of the inquisition was erected in 1570, with a jurisdiction extending as far as the river Mayo, which divides the kingdom of Quito from the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, where the jurisdiction of the tribunal of Cartagena commences. Here are also the tribunal of the holy crusade, established in 1574; the treasury, founded in 1607; and the royal mint, in 1565, and translated to Potosi in 1570, but afterwards reestablished in 1603. The ecclesiastical cabildo is composed of five dignitaries, nine canons, six minor canons, and as many other inferior minor canons. The tribunal of the protomedicato consists of a president, a fiscal, and two examiners. 3c2    380

This city is inhabited by many families of the very first Spanish nobility, amongst which are reckoned 45 titles of Castilla, many knights of the military orders, and 24 rich mayoralties. The house ofAmpuero, -which descends by the female line from the Incas of Peru, enjoys many distinctions and privileges, conceded to them by the kings of Spain. The climate of this city is very healthy and pleasant, although infested by swarms of flies and musquitoes, the whole year round. There is never any other rain than a sort of abundant dew, called garua. It is fertile and copiously supplied with every kind of vegetable production, and fails in nothing either for the necessitiesor conveniences of life. Its commerce also is the best and most flourishing of any city in America. In its cathedral five provincial councils have been celebrated, two by Don Fr. Geronimo de Loaisa, in the years 1551 and 1567; and three by Santo Toribio, in 1582, 1591, and 1601. The infirmities most frequently experienced here are putrid fevers and convulsions, which are called pasmo and cancro. It is very subject to earthquakes, by which it has been frequently destroyed : the strongest of these occurred in the following years, viz. in 1582, 1586, 1609, 1630, 1655, 1678, 1687, 1690, 1697, 1699, 1716, 1725, 1734, 1743, 1746; and in this last in particular it was completely demolished. Its inhabitants amount to 60,000 souls. Its jurisdiction extends to 96 provinces, and the most immediate of these are in number 48.

Its length is 60 leagues from n. w. to s. e. and its width 20 at the broadest part. Its temperature throughout is cold and dry, and consequently it is unfruitful, with the exception of the territories of Lica and Tahua, where they gather very fine bark, the same being a seed similar to the millet, and some papas and onions. Here are abundance of vicunas, huanacos, and vizcachas, very large partridges and ostriches. The rivers which irrigate it are small. That of S. Juan is, however, considerable, and divides this province in part from Tucuman. In some of these rivers are found gold ; and two or three of them, after having run a short distance, lose themselves in the sand. Here are some large llanuras, where they find salt and saltpetre in abundance, from the which, as from some good sulphur which they find in the mountains, which are four in number, and volcanoes, the Indians make powder; grinding the ingredients not in mills, but in skins by mortars. In the district of the settlement of San Antonio, annexed to the curacy of San Pablo, are veins of stone of a round form, similar to 24 pounders, which are accustomed to burst with a great sound, and discovering in the inside some brilliant points resembling diamonds. Here are mines of copper, red and white, mixed with gold  and silver, iron and loadstone, and very many mines of silver ; and these metals, particularly in themineofTaqueh.ua, used to yield three thousand marks each caxon ; so that this province may rightly be considered the most important of any in Peru, and that which has yielded the greatest riches. At present the greater part of the mines have filled with water, and they would, if emptied, still render prodigiously. In the asiento of San Christoval is one, called La Hedionda, on account of the great smell which it discharges from its mouth ; and they assert that the metal in this mine laid in bars. It is abandoned, because whoever enters it is certain to meet his death : and although it might be worked if it were open at top, and if there were adequate energy and fortunes for the undertaking, the want of hands, which has caused the decay of all the mines here, would stand in the way of any advantage, the whole of the inhabitants not exceeding 3500 persons of all ages and sexes. Its corregidor had a repartimiento of 19,800 dollars, and it paid an akavala of 719 : annually. Lipes, the capital, is the settlement of the same name, with the dedicatory title of San Antonio, belonging to the archbishopric of Charcas.

It abounds extremely in neat cattle, with which it supplies the other provinces of the kingdom, as also in horses, and one species of such a nimble and light nature as that with these it is common to run down and tire out the deer, a very common amusement for the natives, who thus kill many and profit by their hides. Here also are found many other species of cattle and birds delicious to the taste, fish in swarms and of many sorts in the rivers and lakes. Here are found woods of peculiar durability and incorruptibility ; such as guayacanes, gravadillo?, amarillos, cedars, turayes, and infinite others ; trees which yield olives, balsams, and resins, at once medicinal and of the most delightful odour ; such are the curruiay, otava, carana, storax, incense, canafistola, baynilla, zarzaparilla, China root ; also' much wild cacao, purgative herbs, and others which are a certain antidote against the bite of snakes, of which this country is lull. Nor does it abound less in venomous insects ; such as mosquitoes, spiders, gegenes, rodadores, flies, gadflies, wasps, and above all in some green mosquitoes, which they call de gusano, since in their bite they vomit a small imperceptible egg, which produces a gusano or pimple which causes great pain and fever. This last plague has been carried by the cattle into some of the neighbouring provinces.    ==[[Llangas|LLANO]]==, Grande, a settlement of the pro- Here are many tigers, deer, bears, dantas, and  vince and government of Popayan in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada. 
==[[Llanos|LLANOS]]==, a province and government of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, and one of the most extensive; discovered by Gonzalo Ximinez de Quesadain 1541, when he went out on the discovery of the famous Dorado ; and he was astonished to find llanos or levels, extending for upwards of 600 leagues from n. to s. from the river of Canela on the skirts of the cordillera of Peru, as far as the coasts of the N. sea; where the great river Maranon or of Amazonas disembogues itself, serving as a boundary to this province, and dividing it from the kingdom of Brazil. Its width is 200 leagues, and in some parts 300. It is watered by several abundant rivers ; amongst the which the most notable are the Apure, Meta, Casanari, and the Orinoco, the greatest of them all, and into which all the others enter. It is very fertile and pleasant, of a temperature so immoderately hot, that were it not for the refreshment afforded by the «. wind it were quite uninhabitable. It has no other seasons but winter and summer. The first, which is the rainy season, is from April to November, and the second is when the rains cease,  other animals ; some snakes of such vast size as to appear like trunks of trees, and called buliios, and to which is attributed the power of attracting to them ether creatures by their breath. This country is most fruitful in all the vegetable productions that one can imagine, and those the most cultivated are maize and yucas ; not but that all these advantages are superseded by the aforesaid distressing visitations, and by the circumstance of its being of a very sickly climate. The Jesuits had a mission here of four settlements, now under the charge of the religious of S. Francisco. The capital of the whole of this province is of the same name. 
• Llanos. It is the city, with the dedicatory title of S. Juan ; founded in 1555 by Juan de Avellaneda, in the part where stood the settlement called by Jorge de Spira, De Nuestra Seiiora, and by Nicolas de Fedreman, conqueror of Venezuela, De la Fragua ; on the shore of the river Cunimia, and near the river Ariari. It is most abundant in gold mines, which were formerly worked, and produced largely, but which are now abandoned : its inhabitants, who may amount to about 50 poor housekeepers, living in great po- Sd2  
*•*   9m   388  verty. It is of an hot and unhealthy temperature, 87 miles s. s. e. from Santa Fe, in lat. 3° 1 1' n. and long. 73° 55' 30" w. 
Llanos, an alcaldia mayor and jurisdiction of Nueva Espana; extending over some extensive llanos, of which it is composed, and which are covered with cultivated estates, which annually produce in abundance, wheat, maize, and other seeds, of which consists the commerce of the natives ; as also in the breeding of large and small cattle and swine. The Indians cultivate likewise many fruits and herbs, which they carry for sale to the surrounding markets ; some of them exercising themselves in the fishery of bobo and trout in the large river Xonocotlan ; which fertilizing with its waters the country from the settlement of Santiago, passes through other provinces, till it enters the sea. 
Here are also mountains which abound in waters, and extending as far as Tlatlauquitepec, and which are so fertilized by these streams as to cause the whole face of the serrania to be covered with flowers and fruittrees, and most particularly apples. There are good symptoms of there being mines in these mountains ; and in 1725, there were found in the river Teitic, at the foot of the mountain called Jolozin, some large rifted pieces of, earth, which were spangled with grains of silver, and even some lumps of this metal. But although it was frequently attempted to discover where these pieces were disrupted, such was the unevenness and craggy face of the territory as to mock all search. These parts abound in monkeys, parrots, and pheasants ; also in lions, tigers, and venomous serpents, called nauyaques. The population consists of 11 settlements, as follows :  
Tezuitlan, 
Tlatlauquitepec, 
Tenextlatiloyan, 
Xonacatlan, 
Xuchitlan.  
Zacapuaztla, 
S.Juan Quimixtlan,

Chichiquila, 
S. Francisco de Ixtac, 
Maztitlan, 
The capital is the settlement of the same name, with the dedicatory title of San Juan; situate in a very large llano, shellered from every wind. It is of a dry and cold temperature, of a large population, but built without regularity; since the streets are at a great distance from each other, the houses naked and scattered ; and thus is its square one of the largest in the kingdom. It has many immediate wards, which surround it on all sides, and in these inhabit 200 families of Spaniards, Mulattoes, and Mustees, and 1000 Indians. It is 38 leagues e. of Mexico.

Its length is about 94 miles, and its medium breadth not above 10 miles ; and separated from Connecticut by Long island sound. It contains 1400 square miles ; and is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Suffolk; and t : iese again into 19 townships. The n. side of the inland is rough and hilly. A single range of these hills extends from Jamaica to Southhold. The soil is here well calculated for raising grain, hay, and fruit. The s. side of the island lies low, with a light sandy soil. On the seacoast are extensive tracts of salt meadow, which extend from Southampton to the w. end of the island.

The cause has never been investigated. Two miles to the s. of the pond, is a stream called Connecticut river, which empties into the bay. The produce of the middle and w. parts of the island is carried to New York. The island contained in 1790, 41,782 inhabitants, of whom 4839 were slaves.]

The Father Charlevoix makes a very favourable description of these Neofites, who, he asserts, have a peculiar simplicity and rectitude in their customs. They have embraced the Catholic faith in all its purity, and exercise the virtues without any corruptive vice whatever.

==[[Louisbourg|LOUISBOURG]]==, a city and capital of the island of Cape Breton in N. America, with one of the best ports of that country, and four leagues in circumference, also of sufficient depth all over, and having an entrance of only 300 toises wide. This port is formed by two small islands] and at the distance    LOU  of 12 leagues may be distinguished cape Lorerabec, which is nearly to the n.e. It abounds greatly in codfish, which are caught from the month of April to December. The English, commanded by Admiral Peter Warren, and the land forces under Colonel William Papparel, took it from the French in 1745 ; but it was restored to those in the peace of Aixla- Chapelle in 1748. It was retaken under the orders of Admiral Boscawen and Lieutenantgeneral Amherst, in 1758, when the fortifications were demolished. 
The city is situate on a long strip of land, to the 5. e. of the island. Its streets are wide and regular; the houses, for the greater part, of stone, with a great square where the parade is held, at a short distance from the citadel ; the which is a square of 200 feet front. In the n. part, during the possession of the French, was the governor's house and the church ; and the other sides were occupied by casemates bombproof, wherein the women and children lay in security in time of war. 
The city is about half a mile in circuit. The port, at the narrowest part, is a mile wide from n. w. to s. e. and six miles from n.e. to s. w. In the n. e. part is a good place for careening vessels, as these may here lie perfectly secure and sheltered from wind : and in the n. part, where the fishery is carried on, 2000 vessels may lie close to the land. In the winter it is impassable from the intense frost : this season begins in November, and lasts till May and June. Sometimes the frosts set in earlier, and are very strong, as was that of the year 1745, when in the middle of October a great part of the port was already frozen. The principal, if not the only commerce of Louisbourg, is the codfishery ; and from this the inhabitants derive great emolument, as the cod caught here are finer than any of these seas. 
The inhabitants deposit their stores in large magazines, some of which are within the fort, and others on the seashore ; though some keep their goods aboard their fishing vessels. An inhabitant will be master of 40 or 50 of these barks, with three or four men to each ; and to these, besides wages, he is obliged to give a certain portion of the fish caught. Thus there is always a great supply on hand, and ready to export by the vessels arriving from most of the French ports, who here leave in exchange other kinds of food and necessaries ; thoUgh some of the inhabitants make shipments on their own account to Europe. 
Vessels also arrive here to take aboard this fish from the French colonies of St. Domingo and  Martinique, bartering for it sugar, tobacco, coffee, rum, &c. What remains is sent to Canada, in exchange for skins of castor and other animals. This was not the only port in which the French laded with cod, for many vessels proceeded to the n. coast and the banks of Newfoundland. Besides the inhabitants of Louisbourg, there are great numbers of French established on the coasts of the neighbouring islands, particularly that of St. John, where, besides their dwellings, they have storehouses and piles of fish : these having found this trade more lucrative and less hazardous than the pursuits of agriculture ; inasmuch as, in the winter, the ground is constantly covered with snow ; sometimes three and four feet deep, and which does not disappear till the summer has well entered ; it being evident that there is thus scarce time for the fruits to ripen. Louisbourg is in lat. 45°57'«, Long. 59° 54' w.

Louisiana is intersected by a number of fine rivers, among which are St. Francis, the Natchitoches, the Adayes or Mexicano river, the Missouri, Rouge, Noir, and many others, which are described under their respective names. The greater part of the white inhabitants are Roman Catholics. The quantity of good land on the Mississippi and its branches, from the bay of Mexico to Ohio river, a distance of nearly 1000 miles, is very great ; but that in the neighbourhood of the Natchez, and of the river Yazoo, is the flower of it all. There have been some plantations of sugarcanes ; but it is not a crop to be depended upon, as the frost lias sometimes been too powerful for that plant. The chief articles of exportation are indigo, cotton, rice, beans, myrtle, wax, and lumber-  The climate is said to be favourable for health, and to the culture of fruits of various kinds, and particularly for garden vegetables. Iron a,nd lead mines, and salt springs, it is asserted, are found in such plenty as to afford an abundant supply of these necessary articles. The banks of the Mississippi, for many leagues in extent, commencing about 20 miles above the mouth of Ohio, are a continued chain of limestone. A fine tract of high, rich, level land, s. w., w., and n.w. of New Madrid, about 25 miles wide, extends quite to the river St. Francis. 
While the United States were engaged in the revolution war against England, the Spaniards attacked and possessed themselves of all the English posts and settlements on the Mississippi, from the Ibberville up to the Yazoo river, including the Natchez country; and by virtue of this conquest have since peopled and governed an extent 3° n. of the United States' s. boundary, claiming the exclusive navigation of the other. This business was amicably settled by the treaty of 1796. 
The Mississippi, on which the fine country of Louisiana is situated, was first discovered by Ferdinand de Soto in 1541. Monsieur de la Salle was the first who traversed it : he, in the year 1682, having passed down to the mouth of the Mississippi, and surveyed the adjacent country, returned to Canada, from whence he took passage to France. From the flattering accounts which he gave of the country, and the consequent advantages that would accrue from settling a colony in those parts, Louis XIV. was induced to establish a company for the purpose. Accordingly, a squadron of four vessels, amply provided with men and provisions, under the command of Monsieur de la Salle, embarked with an intention to settle near the mouth of the Mississippi : but he unintentionally sailed a hundred leagues to the w. of it, where he attempted to establish a colony ; but, through the unfavourableness of the climate, most of his men miserably perished, and he himself was villanously murdered, not long after, by two of his own men. Monsieur Ibberville succeeded him in his laudable attempts. He, after two successful voyages, died while preparing for a third. Crozat succeeded him ; and in 1712, the king gave him Louisiana. This grant continued but a short time after the death of Louis XIV. In 1763, Louisiana was ceded to the king of Spain ; and since 1803, a part of it has formed one of the territorial governments of the United States; the populationof wh ich,according to the census of 1810, amounted to 20,845 souls. 
The following is Melford's account of the Spa-    nish strength in the Floridas and Louisiana, in 
1790 :

All the Spanish settlers in these districts are under the immediate orders of the military commandants, and subject to martial law, with an appeal from stage to stage, up to the viceroy of Mexico. The property of the subject, at his decease, is to be managed by the commandant, whose fees are settled by law, and amount to 25 per cent.]

==[[Loxa|LOXA]]==, a province and corregimiento of Quito, bounded n. by the province of Guayaquil, s. by thatol Yaguarsongo, e. by that of Jaen, and a;. by the city Zamora. It is of a. benign and healihy temperature, and fertile in all kinds of grain, fruits, and cattle; the grain being in such abundance that much more is carried away by the floods than is consumed by the people, the inhabitants. Its particular cattle are cows and mules, of which great numbers are taken for the supply of the other provinces, even as far as Quito Its principal commerce is in woven stuffs of cotton and wool, of which there are many fabrics ; also in carpets, which have a peculiar estimation. In this province they gather abundant supplies of cochineal, which the natives empioy for dyeing their fabrics, selling to the province of Cuenca the surplus. Here also, in the city of Zaruma, some gold mines are worked, although of very bad alloy, as the metal does not exceed 14 carats'; so that it is only fit for making common utensils, such as buckles, reliccases, and snuffboxes; and without these few persons are to be seen, however poor their circumstances. 
The principal source of riches in this country is the bark, called here cascarilla de Loxa, which is not found elsewhere : it is in quantity sufficient for the demands of the whole world, and it is indeed an article of commerce exported to all nations. Although it is the opinion of some writers that the Indians knew its virtue in fevers, and that they actually used it in like circumstances, it is certain that it was never in great repute here till the year 1730, it being thought that the bark of Europe and other parts was most efficacious in dyeing, this being the way in which the bark of thisr place was employed. As soon, however, as its worth was known, its cultivation became more important; and some time after Mr. Jusieu, professor of botany, and who had passed over to Peru, in company with the academicians of the sciences at Paris, visited Loxa, and taught the natives the mode of gathering it, of using it, of making extract from it, how to distinguish its qualities, and many other operations equally curious as useful. The vast mountains on which this tree grows begin 10 leagues before you arrive at the llano of Cuzibamba, and reach as far as the province of Yaguarsono, a distance of upwards of 70 leagues.

Zozoranga, EI Cizne, Dominguillo, Catacocha, Malacatos, San Pedro del Valle, San Lucas de Ambocas. The capital stands in a beautiful and extensive valley, which they call Cuzibamba, and was founded by Captain Alonso de Mercadillo, in 1546, between two rivers which flow down from the Cordillera Nevada, with the names of Pulacu and Guacamana, and which, after watering and fertilizing the valley, unite at a small distance, in a spot called, from this circumstance, De las Juntas. It ^tood formerly in the llanura of Cangachamba, and was called Zarga, from whence it was translated to the spot where it now is. Its temperature is hot, though not in the extreme, and it is healthy, and of a territory of such fertility that, not having a population equal to its productions, great part of its fruits are constantly lost. 
It has two parishes, three convents of the following religious orders: St. Francisco, St. Domingo, and La Merced ; and it had also a college of the Jesuits, and an hospital. It has suffered much from the earthquakes which it has experienced, and by which it has been broughtto a state of great dilapidation, so as to be abandoned by many noble families ; and, although there be some still remaining, its population consists of only 10,000 souls of all ages and sexes, including Mustees, Mulattoes, and people of colour.

==[[Luanco|LUANCO]]==, a settlement of Indians, of the province and corregimieMo of Vilcas Huaman in Peru ; annexed to the curacy of Zancos. 
==[[Lucanas|LUCANAS]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru, bounded n. and n. w. by the province of Castro Virreyna, e. and s. e. by that of Parinacochas, n. e. by that of Vilcas Huaman and Andahuailas, s. w. and w. by that of Camana. It is 60 leagues long and 30 wide, and in some parts it is as narroAV as 12. Its situation is amongst spiring rocks of the cordillera, with very few llanos, and even these extremely small. The temperature is that of the sierra, cold throughout the year; and thus are its vegetable productions reduced to papas, ocas, wheat, barley, and maize; also in some of the ravines grow seeds and pastures, especially in those which look towards Camana, where they cultivate some fruit trees, such as peaches, figs, apples, and others ; though with all this they are forced to supply themselves with all necessaries, except meat, from the other provinces, for the subsistence of the people labouring in the mines ; nor is even the cattle here in such abundance as in the other provinces. Close to the settlement of Larcay, of the curacy of Soras, is a stream of hot medicinal water, the heat of which is excessive. There are not in this province other estates of consideration than those in which they grind the metals of silver. It is this alone which causes this province to keep up a kind 3 F    402  LUC  of trade with the rest ; and but for it, its population would soon dwindle to nothing ; nor would those bordering upon it have wherewithal to sell their commodities. It has not, with the exception of some streams, anymore than one large river, which incorporates itself with that of Vilcas Huaman, and in it they catch some trout. 
In short, what gives the whole existence to this province, are its silver mines, the which are near the settlement of San Juan, annexed to the curacy of Lucanas. The principal veins which have been discovered are 10; and some of these have been worked to the depth of 50, and others SO fathom. These metals are prepared by quicksilver and salt, with the aid of copper, which they here call colpa. This method was discovered by Don Lorenzo de la Torre, who was master of the principal veins ; and the same practice has been adopted at many other mines in the kingdom, where the metal is found to be of a nature similar, or little differing. What these mines produce yearly amounts to from 20 to 25,000 marks of silver ; and the vein which at the most does not yield more than eight marks a caxon, and that which at the least yields four marks, would produce much more if they had but people sufficient to work them: but in this province there are few Indians fit for the purpose ; and, including the Spaniards and Mustees engaged in mining, the persons employed scarcely exceed 10,000 of all classes. 
Its corregidor had a repartimiento of 124,200 dollars, and it paid an alcavala of 4968 dollars yearly. The capital is the settlement of the same name, in hit. 14° 58' s. and the others contained in its jurisdiction are the following :

It is nearly 24 miles long from », to 5. and 10 wide, and has in it several mountains, two of which being round and pointed, are called by mariners the Breasts of St. Lucia j and both of them are said to be volcanoes. At the foot of them are some very good fertile plains, well irrigated, and abounding with large trees, the timber of which is used by the inhabitants of Martinique and Barbadoes for building houses and windmills. It produces also much cacao. The climate is esteemed healthy, for the mountains not being excessively lofty, they do not impede the course of the winds, which generally blow from the e. and mitigate the heat, making the climate delightful. It has different bays and ports very convenient, especially one called Carenero Chico, from which the French preferred this island to the rest ; and in this likewise the English wished to build a fort, 3f2  jgmrsm  LUC  through its advantages of having a good bottom, and three places where vessels might be careened. In it SO ships of the line may lie sheltered from hurricanes. 
[The boats ofthe country, which have been kept a longtime in this harbour, have never been eaten by the worms ; however, they do not expect that this advantage will last, whatever be the cause. For the other harbours, the winds are always good -to go out with, and the largest squadron might be In the offing in less than an hour.] 
This island has been possessed and surrendered several times by the English and the French, until that it was settled in 1722, by the courts of these nations, that it should be evacuated together with that of St. Vincent, until that its destiny should be amicably determined. Shortly afterwards, however, the English resolved to appropriate it to themselves, and King George I. gave it, together with that of St. Vincent, to the Duke of Montague; who, going to great expence, sent hither Captain Uring as governor, with people, arms* instruments, and other things necessary to the establishment of the colony. This, therefore, left England with a convoy of seven vessels, defended by the ship of war the Winchelsea, and disembarked at St. Lucia ; but it was shortly after obliged to leave its situation, owing to the superior force of the French of Martinique, wheii it was agreed that it should be evacuated until the right of possession was amicably settled. Not-  . withstanding this, the French returned to establish themselves ; and in the peace of Versailles of 1763, it was ceded to these, who have since built many forts for its defence. [The British made themselves masters of it in 1758 ; but it was restored again to the French in 1783, and retaken by the British in 1794. St. Lucia had 900 of its inhabitants destroyed by an earthquake, October 12, 1788.] 
It is divided into nine parishes, eight being on one part of the island and only one on the other; this preference arising, not from any better quality ofthe soil, but from the greater convenience forvessels to enter and go out of port. A great road which surrounds the whole island, and two others which cross it from e. to as. facilitate the bringing of effects to the vessels. In 1769, the free inhabitants amounted to 2524, the slaves to 10,270. It had 598 mules and horses, 1819 head of large cattle, and 2378 of smaller. Its plantations were reduced to 1,279,680 plants of cacao, 2,463,880 of coffee, 681 square plots of cotton, and 254 of sugarcanes ; 18 sugarengines, and 16 which were being erected : and all the above producing a revenue of 112,000/. which has since increased to 500,000/.

Its figure is nearly circular, as the river girts it in a direction from n. w. to n. e. On the e. part runs another great river named Uccubamba ; which rising in   the steeps of the province of Caxamarquilla, and becoming enlarged in that of Chachapoyas by the Taulia and others, enters the Maranon, nearly opposite the port of Tomependa, of the province of Jaen, in the vicinity of the lofty mountains called Reintema, where its streams are tributary to that river. Also here is another great river, called Chinchipe, which flowing down from Loxa, passes through the province of Jaen. This province, of which we treat, is equally small as poor ; being scarcely 18 leagues long from s. e. to n. w. and somewhat less than eight in an opposite direction ; although it has, indeed, a long strip of land running into the jurisdiction of Chachapoyas, and extending 5. nearly as far as that of Caxamarquiila. 
This province was erected in the time of Lope Garcia de Castro, governor of Peru in 1569 ; and was established in all form by the viceroy Don Francisco cle Toledo in the following year. Its temperature is very good with respect to heat and cold, since in some parts the spring lasts all the year ; not but that there are some cold settlements, and amongst the rest the capital Luya, as through this passes a branch of the Cordillera. The climate is very moist in some parts bordering on the Maranon, and consequently sickly, especially in tertians. It abounds greatly in vegetable productions, fruits, seeds, wheat, maize, &c. ; also in cattle, sheep, mares, mules, horses, cows. It produces much cotton and tobacco, of which 7 to 8000 arrobas are gathered annually ; and it yielded 60,000 bundles before it became a part of the royal revenue. Here also is fabricated very white sugar, and they collect some cacao, black wax, and zarzaparilla. In its forests grow very fine sorts of wood; such as cedars, walnuts, carobs, guayacanes, mulberries, and in the tunal grounds some cochineal. 
The inhabitants, who amount to only 3500, dress leather to make shoes and strops, much esteemed. In the rivers are abundance of large and small fish of the most delicate kind. Amongst the particular productions of this province is found a bird called organo, (organ), imitating very exactly this instrument in its song; another called trompetero, (trumpeter), which, fixing its head in the ground and blowing through the upper part, gives a sound just like a trumpet; monkeys of many kinds, and some which sleep all the day and watch all the night. It abounds in all kinds of snakes and reptiles ; and there grows here a tree, which they call Ml, of so noxious a quality, that any one passing near it, immediately begins to swell, and can only be cured by strong caustics ; though the animals    have an instinct teaching them to shun it vol,. II.  
Here  is likewise an herb, to which they give the name of aljosucha, which being rubbed between the hands, and applied to the smell, is a great preservative to travellers both against the influence of heat and cold, as also of tertians in the parts which are subject to them. 
In the mountains are some mines of gold and silver, but none of them are worked. Its corregidor had a repartimiento of only 25,000 dollars, paying 1000 yearly. The capital is the settlement of the same name ; the others of its population are,

==[[Macas|MACAS]]==, a district of the province and government of Quixos and Macas, one of those which compose. the same government, being the most e. part in the kingdom of Quito; bounded s. by the province of Jaen de Bracainoros or Yaguarsongo, and to. by those of Riobamba and Cuenca, from the which it is separated by the e. cordillera of the Andes ; and, being in this vicinity, of a temperature very different from that of the district of Quixos, namely much colder, tiie seasons of the year also being more regular : the winter begins in the month of April, and lasts till September, which is the time when the summer is experienced in the parts lying between the two cordillcras ; and from September forward they obtain in Macas the benefit of this second season, when the air blows fresh from the n. in proportion to the quantity of frost and snow lying up&n the mountain deserts. Its territory is fertile for seeds and fruits, these being such as require a hot and moist temperature ; but the principal crop is that of tobacco, which is gathered in great abundance, and carried in rolls   to be sold over all Peru, being particularly prized through its fine quality. Here are likewise produced sugarcanes and cotton ; but not more, either of one or the other, than is necessary for the consumption of the inhabitants; and even this not, without a constant care on their part to guard their plantations against the incursions of the barbarian Indians, by whom every town is surrounded, and who oblige the inhabitants to live with arms perpetually in their hands. The whole of this district, as well as the other, is covered with wild woods, in which is found the storaxtree, the aromatic gum or resin of which is very fragrant: this is, however, very scarce, owing to the distance of these trees from the settlements, and the risk attending those who go in search for them of being massacred by the Indians, who, like wild beasts, hide themselves in the hollow trunks and in the thickets. The same observation obtains with regard to the minerals of blue stones, which are found hereof a very superior quality; although, in spite of these difficulties, small portions arc not unfrequently procured. Here are also found cinnamontrees of the best quality, and differing from those of Quixos. This advantage is derived from the trees growing in a more open spot, w here they derive (he benefit of the sun and air; and (here is a particular example of this in a tree which, either from chance or design, is growing near the capital ; and which has a bark so delicate to the taste, and so fragrant, as. to exceed the finest cinnamon of the East. The flower of this tree is likewise very fine. This district abounds in mines of copal, in wild honey, though not of,a good qualify, since, besides the defect of being red, it wants consistency, and the candles made of it exhale, when lighted, a very strong smell: the bees which manufacture this wax are different from those of Europe; they arc larger, and inclining to a black colour. In the woods is found a snake, which is called by the Indians Curimullinvo, the skin of which is of a gold colour, with spots similar tothose of a tiger. It has a tremendous appearance, is covered with scales, having an ugly head, and teeth and grinders as large as those of an ordinarysized dog, but sharper. The town consists of 1200 souls, the greater part being of Mustees, Mulattoes,. and other casts. The Spaniards who dwell here are very few ; and what there are, are divided into the eight following settlements, S. Miguel de Naryaezj Zuna, Juan Lopez, Aguayos,

Early attempts were made to settle here, but the first permanent settlement was made in 1763, by 15 persons of both sexes from Scarborough, in Cumberland county ; and in 1784 the town was incorporated. The chief settlements are at the e. and w. falls, and at Middle river.

The millsaws, of which there are 17, cut on an average three million feet of boards annually. A great proportion of timber is usually shipped in British vessels. The total amount of exports annually exceeds 15,000 dollars.

In the woods are also found the balsam of copal, and another called amine, the herb escornzonera, (viperroot), also a reed called Colorado, and the agras, which, when a piece of it is cut off, and one end blown through, distils from the other end a quantity of water of a singular virtue, as has been experienced, against the infirmities of the eyes, destroying dimness, cataracts, &c.

[Maddison's Cave, the largest and most celebrated cave in Virginia ; situated on the n. side of the Blue ridge. It is in a hill of about 200 feet perpendicular height, the ascent of which on one side is so steep, that you may pitch a biscuit from its summit into the river which washes its base. The entrance of the cave is in this side, about twothirds of the way up. It extends into the earth about 300 feet, branching into subordinate caverns, sometimes ascending a little, but more generally descending, and at length terminates in two different places, at basons of water of unknown extent, and which appear to be nearly on a level with the water of the river. The vault of this cave is of solid limestone, from 20 to 40 or 50 feet high, through which water is continually exudating. This trickling down the sides of the cas^e has incrusted them over in the form of elegant drapery ; and dripping from the top of the vault, generates on that, and on the base below, stalactites of a conical form, some of which have met and formed large massy columns.]

==[[Madera|MADERA]]==, a large, abundant, and navigable river of Peru. It rises in the mountains of Chuquisaca of the province of Charcas; it runs an e. course to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, with the names of La Plata, Chuquisaca, Cachimayo, and Guapay ; and turns its course n. to enter the Marafion or Amazon, with the name of La Madera, (or Wood), on account of the vast quantities it carries down with its current, and is one of the largest of those which enter the aforesaid river. The Indians call it Cuyari or Cayari, and they affirm that by it is the shortest passage to the provinces of 3 H  D*'*  MAD    Peru by the Mararion or Amazon. It has indeed been visited by some Portuguese, in 1741, as far as lat. 18° s. near to Santa Cruz de la Sierra. From this river the Portuguese know the Mararion by the name of'Amazonas, and up to it, by the name of Solimoes. According to the geographer Don Juan de la Cruz, it keeps the name of Madera only from the junction of the Marmore Grande and the ltenes, until where it runs into the Mararion or Amazon. In the woods immediately upon its banks are great quantities of wild cacao trees ; and here dwell various nations of infidel Indians, namely, the Chiquitos, Tapagazus, Avacaries, Curanaris, Guarinumas, Agazos, and some Tupinambos. This river abounds in exquisite fish, especially in seacows ; and on its shores are found tortoises and alligators. It enters, as we have before observed, into the Maranon or Amazon, by the s. side, in about 3° 24' 18" s. latitude.

It is in a craggy, rough, and barren spot, and produces nothing but maize, of which, however, two very abundant crops are gathered yearly. It has some gold mines in its district, which are scarcely worked, owing to the MAG poverty of the neighbourhood; in short, it appears rather like a miserable village than a city, this name being but ill suited to it. It is 35 leagues almost s. of Popayan. Madrigal, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Collahuas in Peru.

==[[Magallanes|MAGALLANES]]==, Estrecho de, a channel or celebrated pass which communicates the N. and S. seas, formed by the extremity of the continent of America, and the island called Tierra del Fuego. It was discovered by Fernando de Magallanes, a Portuguese, in 1520, who gave it his name ; but others call it the strait of All Saints. Its length from e. to w. is 110 leagues, and its width at its broadest part is one. It is very dangerous to pass, on account of the force of the currents^ as well as of its rocks and sandbanks, and from the high winds which prevail. That part of the continent which is considered the n. is called the coast of the Patagonians, (Patagones), under which article we shall say every thing that relates thereto ; and in the w. part of the coast are innumerable small islands, inhabited by some few barbarians. In 1579, the Admiral Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa founded, by order of Philip II. two towns in this strait, the one being called Nombre de Dios and the other Filipolis ; Don Francisco de Toledo then being viceroy of Peru, and also the same person who sent the admiral upon this commission : but the colonists and founders perished through want, and the place has since that period been called Port of Hunger. The English and all other nations frequented this pass before that they discovered the strait of Maire, a much shorter and safer passage; it was then entirely abandoned. Its e. mouth or entrance is in lat. 52° 32' s. and the w. mouth in 52° 40'. [The temperature of these straits in summer has been wrongly compared by Commodore Byron with the climate of England in midwinter ; the fact is, that the summers are agreeable, and the winters far from severe ; and the floating islands of ice which are frequently met with in these seas, particularly in the summer, are driven by the s. winds blowing from the antarctic regions.] Series of the most celebrated Navigators who have passed this Strait.

MAGALLANICAS Tierras, a large and spacious country, extending from n. to s. from the llanuras of Paraguay, called Pampas, to the Estrecho de Magallanes or straits of Magellan; washed on the e. by the sea of Magellan, and w. by the Pacific. It is inhabited by some barbarous nations of Indians but little knovyn, amongst whom are the Patagones or Tirumencos, of a prodigious stature and well formed ; the Cesares to the e. of the source of the river of Santo Domingo ; the Poyas and the Puelches, bordering upon the kingdom of Chile, and being divided from the same by the river Sur Fondo, which empties itself into the Pacific or S. sea, in lat. 44° 38' s. and serves as the s. boundary of Chiloe. The territory of the e. coast is low, barren, and desert ; and towards the s. upon the strait, it is lofty and full of woods and mountains covered with snow, where the great chain of the cordillera of the Andes terminates. These woods and mountains abound in tigers, wolves, snakes, monkeys of different kinds, parrots, and other birds of most beautiful plumage. The interior of this vast continent is' entirely unknown to European nations. The Father Nicolas Mascardi, of thecompany of Jesuits in theprovince of Chile, wasthefirst missionary who passed through Chiloe, and preached the gospel to those barbarians, receiving at their hands the crown of martyrdom. The climate towards the s. is very cold, and in the Pampas to the n. very hot. The Chilenos consider this territory as part of their kingdom. The Father Manuel Garcia, missionary of the extinguished company, is the first who in his map, dated April 1746, gave an account of the customs of these barbarians, who are generally called serranos, although they are divided into two tribes with the names of Puelches and Tuelches : these last are known at Buenos Ayres by the name  

MAG  of Magdalenistas ; since at onetime, when a famine happened, they came as far up the country as to the settlement called Magdalena : the ofhers are called Pampas Matanzeros, they having, from the same cause, settled themselves near the settlement of Matanza, not far from Buenos Ayres. All these Indians are like those of the other s. settlements, fickle, inconstant, and irresolute; few, however, exceed tbem in fierceness and arrogance, and none in the miserable state in which they live, or in the poverty consequent upon their sloth ; although some indeed have settled near the Spanish towns, and get their livelihold by industry. Those who inhabit the mountains, although the cold there is intense, prefer going naked to the trouble of making themselves garments, if perchance they may not buy some of the Aucaes, a people who breed cattle, and make these articles of their fleeces. They sow wheat, and grinding it between two stones, make little cakes. They have copper and other metals, which they found to make spoons and other utensils, though these are very scarce. They do not kill their cattle to eat, but when hungry they bleed them and drink their blood. Their common food is the flesh of asses, foxes, ostriches, and guanacos. Those who are in commerce with the Spaniards have learnt to game ; and so great is the influence of this vicious passion upon them, that they will sometimes continue playing whole nights and days without sleep. They are extremely usurious in their contracts, and whatever the Spaniards may offer, they are sure to exact something more : they will go many leagues for a trifle : they buy to sell again, and their good faith is on a par with that of highway robbers : they are subject to the most abject vices, and are void of all natural shame or modesty. They are not without ideas of a Supreme Being, and in their idioms they have words for expressing him, but they are not known to offer him any kind of adoration, although it was asserted by a Spaniard, who had lived for some time a captive amongst them, and who told the same to the Father Garcia before mentioned, that be had always heard them mention his (the Supreme Being's) name with veneration. There are suspicions that the Aucaes adore the sun, since, when they catch any animal in the chase, they throw up the blood towards this luminary ; the women also, when they have brought forth, immediately present their children to the moon as an offering, and as an acknowledgment that they owe them to her liberality, or perhaps that she may pour down her salutary influence upon them. They believe in the immortality of soul, and when any one dies, 3h2  
■4J.J rMW-l  MAG  

MAG    the old women collect together in their cabins, and sitting down, make lamentable plaints, to which the relatives answer in the same tone ; after some days the body is carried out to be buried, together with all the articles that were used by the person when living, taking great care not to leave any thing that may cause a remembrance, burning even the cabin in which he lived, and arguing it as one of the most unfavourable omens should they happen to dream of him. They are full of superstition and witchcrafts, and to this the women are particularly given, although all prize themselves much upon having frequent communication with the devil. Marriage is contracted by the purchase of the wife, and a man, when he does not agree with one, remedies the evil by buying another ; but the caciques and the rich alone are able to buy the number they wish for. When any one dies without children the brother marries the widow ; and if the wife dies, the vacancy is filled up in the same way by her sister, should she have any, and provided she be a widow. The love which the fathers and mothers bear towards their children is most extravagant ; they never chastise or reprehend them, even though these should manifest the greatest insolence, or, even at the moment of passion, strike them : on the contrary, should such a case occur, they, the parents, immediately make what they style a feast of reconciliation. The father speaks to the son with the highest respect and in the plural number ; the son, with the greatest indignity to the father, and in the singular. These being their habits, there was no end to the disorders which arose amongst them, and the hope of reducing them to the faith, in proportion, declined ; but in 1739, four chiefs arrived at Buenos Ay res, requesting of the colonel Don Juan de San Martin, that some of the Jesuits might be sent to instruct them in the Christian faith : accordingly, advice being sent to the governor Don Miguel Salcedo, this person wrote to the father Lucas Machoni, then provincial, who taking occasion of the opportunity that presented itself, sent to the fathers Matias, Strobl, and Manuel Quirini, who offered themselves voluntarily, and laboured with much success in the reduction of these infidels.

==[[Magdalena|MAGDALENA]]==, Grand river of the, one of the largest in S. America, in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada; discovered in 1525, by Rodrigo JBastidas, on the day of St. Mary Magdalen, in memory of whom he gave it this name. Garcia de Lerma was the first who navigated this river, in 1531. It rises in the province of Popayan from two fountains, which are in the mountains to the w. ofTimana, through which it passes; it then traverses and irrigates the province and government of Neiba, and follows its course from s. to n. running upwards of 300 leagues before it enters the sea, and first receiving the waters of many other rivers, with which its stream becomes much enlarged: some of these tributary streams are of themselves abundant rivers, and such are the Cauca, Cesar or Pompatao, Carari, Macates, Ue la Miel, Zarate, and others. It passes through Honda, Mompox, Tenerife, Tamalameque, and other settlements ; and is navigable from its mouth as far as the town and port of Honda, the same being a distance of 160 leagues. Its shores are covered with thick woods, in which dwell some barbarian Indians, who are ferocious and treacherous. Here also breed immense tigers, and the river swarms with an incredible multitude of alligators as well as with every kind offish. By this river you pass to the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, ancT on it is brought every kind of merchandize, and a great traffic carried on by means of large flatbottomed boats, which are here called champanes; but the navigation is rendered exceedingly irksome, not only on account of the heat, but through the great number of musquitoes with which this river is infested. At its entrance into the sea it forms a small isle or rock, which is desert, and is called the Isla Verde. The waters of this river do not embody themselves with the sea for a distance of more than 20 leagues ; and as far as this they are perfectly pure and sweet to drink. Its mouth is about 63 miles to the n. e. of Cartagena, in lat. 11°2'«.

Magua, a kingdom of Hispanola or St. Domingo, and one of the four into which it was divided, when the island was first discovered by Christopher Columbus, its name signifies a level, since it comprehended that territory which was afterwards called Vega Real, the same being 80 leagues in length and 10 wide. Fr. Bartolome de las Casas asserts, that upwards of 300 rivers take their rise here ; and that, of these, 12 are as wide as the Ebro or the Guadalquivir. We must easily conceive that there is much exaggeration in this statement, even should we take into account the small streams, which, without doubt, are very numerous, since the waters of the mountains which lie to the w. take their course through this kingdom. The chief who governed at Magua when the Spaniards arrived, was called Guarionex, and had his capital in the same spot where these afterwards founded the city of La Concepcion de la Vega.

The Spaniards afterwards founded here a town, with the name of San Juan de Maguana, which remained but for a short time, and stood in the spot which the French call Savana de San Ovan.

They have lived in a village, on the w. bank of the Missouri, 236 miles above the mouth of the river Plate, where they cultivated corn, beans, and melons : they were warlike, and the terror of their neighbours. In the summer and autumn of 1802, they were visited by the smallpox, which reduced their numbers to something less than 300 ; they burnt their village, and have become a Avandering nation, deserted by the traders : the consequent deficiency of arms and ammunition has invited frequent aggressions from their neighbours, which have tended to reduce them still further. They rove principally on the waters of the river Quicurre, or Rapid river. The country is generally level, high, and open; it is fertile, and tolerably well watered. They might easily be induced to become stationary ; they are well disposed towards the whites, and are good hunters : their country abounds in beaver and otter, and their trade will increase and become valuable, provided they become stationary, and are at peace.

These Indians were friends and allies to the Spaniards, and were on this account attacked in 1610 by the Guaranies, who killed mnny, and took others prisoners. The Mahamas, however, sought the protection of their allies, and the governor of the Spanish province having rendered them supplies of men, together with an officer and other Indians, who had been brought together by the Father Marcelo Lorenzana, of the extinguished company of Jesuits, conditions of peace were proposed. These were rejected, and the Mahomas, in consequence, pursued their enemies with such valour and firmness, that they completely succeeded in recovering their liberty. They were reduced to the Catholic faith, and a settlement of them formed by San Ignacio Guazu, one of those who formed part of the so celebrated missions of Paraguay, under the care of the Jesuits.

==[[Mainas|MAINAS]]==, a province and government of the kingdom of Quito ; bounded e. by the provinces of Quixos and Jaen de Bracamoros. Its limits on the n. and s. are altogether unknown. This ex-  tensive country takes its name from the numerous nation of Indians who inhabit it, and was conquered in 1618 by General Don Diego Vaca de Vega, •who was its first governor. In 1638, it was visited, for the purpose of shedding the light of the gospel, by the Fathers Gaspar, Cuxia, and Lucas dela Cueva, of the society of tiie Jesuits, who established some very flourishing missions on both shores of the river Maranon. Indeed these missions continued to do infinite good, until the time of the abolition of the order in 1767. In 1635, an insurrection occurred amongst these Mainas Indians, of the city of San Francisco de Borja, but they were again pacified, and once more reduced to a civilized life, through the unabating exertions of the aforesaid missionaries. These Indians are very idle, and inclined to drunkenness, dishonesty, and superstition. They wander naked through the woods, and maintain themselves by fishing and the chase, using for their Aveapons bows and arrows. After these were reduced to the faith and the dominion of the crown of Castille, several other barbarous nations were discovered, who being equally converted by the regulars of the company of Jesuits, formed the missions commonly called De Mainas, which extended from the Pongo or strait of Manseriche, upon the zo. shore of the Maranon, as far as the settlement of Loreto de Ticunas, and s. as far as the river Yavari, in lat. 2° 4', occupying a space of 268 leagues from e. to zo. The climate is very hot and moist, and the territory consists entirely of woods, marshes, lakes, and rivers. The productions are white and black wax, cacao, and zarzaparilla ; and only in some of the llanuras is there grown grain for the subsistence of the inhabitants. In this province is the renowned meridian, or line of demarcation, drawn by the Pontiff Alexander VI,. between the dominion of the kings of Spain and Portugal, a subject which had hitherto caused so much litigation between these two crowns. The capital of this province was formerly the city of San Francisco de Borja, but since the time that this was almost entirely destroyed, this honour has been conferred upon the town of La Laguna ; where resides the superior of the missions, as also the governor, when he goes down from Quito upon his visitation. The other settlements founded by the missions are as follows :  Bartolome coay,  de Ne-

[==[[Maine|MAINE]]==, District of, belonging to Massachusetts, is situated between lat. 43° and 45° 50' n. and between long. 66° 37' and 71° w. ; bounded n. by Lower Canada, e. by the province of New Brunswick, s. by the Atlantic ocean, w. by New Hampshire. The district of Maine is in length, on an average, 200 miles, and its average breadth 120 miles ; containing 40,000 square miles, or 25,600,000 acres. It is divided into five counties, viz. York, Cumberland, Lincoln, Hancock, and Washington : these are subdivided into near 200 incorporated townships and plantations ; inhabited by 96,540 free people. The chief towns are Portland, the metropolis of the district of Maine, York, Pownalborough, and Wiscasset, Hallowell, Bath, Waldoborough, Penobscot, and Machias. The last mentioned is the only incorporated town in Washington county, the other settlements being only plantations. The chief rivers are Penobscot, 3 i  5W*   MAI  
Kennebeck, Saco, Androscoggin, St. Croix, &c. besides a vast number of small rivers. The most noted lakes are Moosehead, Scoodic, and Sebacook. The chief bays are those of Casco, Penobscot, Machias, Saco, and Passamaquoddy. The most remarkable capes arc those of Neddock, Porpoise, Elizabeth, Small point, Pemaquid, and Petit Manan. 
The district of Maine, (hough an elevated (ract of country, cannot be called mountainous. A great proportion of the lands are arable and exceedingly fertile, particularly between Penobscot and Kennebeck rivers. On some parts of the seacoast, the lands are but indifferent. The lands in this district may be considered in three divisions ; (he firs(, comprehending (lie (ract lying e. of Penobscot river, of about 4,500,000 acres ; the second, and best tract, of about 4,000,000 acres, lying between Penobscot and Kennebeck rivers ; the third, first settled and most populous at present, w. of Kennebeck river, containing also about 4,000,000 acres. The soil of this country in general, where it is properly fitted to receive the seed, appears to be very friendly to the growth of wheat, rye, barley, oats, peas, hemp, and flax, as well as for the production of almost all kinds of culinary roots and plants, and for English grass ; and also for Indian corn, especially if the seed be procured from a more n. climate. Hops are the spontaneous growth of this country ; and it is also uncommonly good for grazing, and large stocks of neat cattle may be fed both summer and winter. The natural growth of this district consists of white pine and spruce trees in large quantities, suitable for masts, boards, and shingles; maple, beech, white and grey oak, and yellow birch. The low lands produce fir, which is neither fit for timber nor fuel, but yields a balsam that is highly prized. Almost the whole coast n. e. of Portland is lined wi(h islands, among which vessels may generally anchor wi(h safety. 
The principal exports of this country are various kinds of lumber, as pine boards, ship timber, and every species of split lumber manufactured from pine and oak ; these are exported from the various ports in immense quantities. A spirit of improvement is increasing here. A charter for a college has been granted by the legislature, and five academies incorporated and endowed with handsome grants of public lands. Town schools are generally maintained in most of the towns. The commonwealth of Massachusetts possess between eight and nine million acres in this district, independent of what they have sold or contracted to sell, which bring into the treasury the net sum of 269,0051.  
8s. 7d. currency : and besides about two million acres between St. Croix and Passamaquoddy in dispute between the United States and the British nation. Exclusive of the lands sold, about 385,000 acres have been granted for the encouragement of literature, and other useful and humane purposes. 
Attempts were made to settle this country as early as 1607, on the ay. side of Kennebeck river; but they proved unsuccessful, and were not repeated till between 1620 and 1630. In 1635, the w. part of it was granted to Ferdinando Gorges by the Plymouth company, and he first instituted a government in this province, fn 1652, this province came under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, and Was, by charter, incorporated with it in 1691. Its population has been always increasing greatly ; and in the census of 1810, it numbered 228,705 souls.] 

==[[Maipo|MAIPO]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Rancagua in the kingdom of Chile. It contains six viceparishes, and in the district of its cordillera are the renowned silver mines of Copavana, San Simon, and San Pedro Nolasco, which yielded at their first being worked 500 marks each caxon : at present they only render ftom 20 to 40, and indeed they cannot be worked all the year round. Here is also a copper mine ; and the settlement is near the lake of Aculeo. Maipo, a river of this province and kingdom. It is large, and notorious from the number of persons who have been drowned in it. It rises from the lake Pudaquill, and runs with such force, that at the time of its overflows, no bridge can be found to resist the impetuosity of the current : accordingly the only bridge used is made of ro; es, very strong and tightly knit together. The waters of this river are very thick, and entering as it does into the sea with great violence, it causes the latter to retire as it were a considerable distance from its mouth ; leaving a very visible circle or line of demarcation between its own waters and those of the sea. Its waters are very cold, and do not allay thirst, owing to their being impregnated with particles of salt. This quality, however, renders very delicate, and in high estimation, the flesh of the sheep that feed upon its banks. It abounds in very dainty fish, and particularly in trout. It enters the Pacific or S. sea, in hit. 33° 43' 2" s.

This strait was afterwards discovered by Bartolome and Gonzalo Garcia Nodal in 1618, Juan de Mora in 1619, and Jacob H eremite Clerk in 1621. It is eight leagues long, and its currents are very violent. It has become the common pass for entering into the S. sea, ever since it was discovered, being a shorter route than that through the straits of Magellan.

==[[Malbala|MALBALA]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians, of the province of Chaco in Peru, who dwelt upon the shores of the Rio Grande. They are well featured and of a good size ; they go naked, but are less brutal than others, since they cover the parts of shame with hides made of chaguar ; the women also covering the whole of the body with a sort of cloak. Until they marry, the women are very tolerable to behold, for before this they are not allowed to paint themselves. The manner of painting their faces is by straight blue lines drawn from the forehead down to the chin, and the men will form squares, crosses, and other figures, in painting themselves. These may only have one wife ; and the bridegroom is required to solicit the hand of his intended from her parents, and gains her, having first received all their consents separately. The men and women are mutually regardful of fidelity to each other; and should the woman commit adultery, she is severely and publicly chastised by her own relations. The widows who will not marry again, become public strumpets, and after this their character is looked upon as completely lost, and no one would think of taking them to wife. The hair is accustomed to be worn    flowing down to the shoulders ; but the widows, by way of mourning, have it much longer ; and they further shew their sorrow by not admitting it to be cut, and also by abstaining from fish as long as their widowhood may last. These Indians use the same arms as do the other nations, excepting that the dart maybe carried solely by the caciques and captains. They have a war declared against all the other nations, and profess a union and friendship with no others than the Chinupies and the Velelas. They have nothing to do with agriculture, but subsist entirely by fishing and the chase. They have some breeds of sheep, not for the purpose of eating the flesh, but for profiting by the wool ; of which they make belts, dyed red and adorned with spangles of little shells : these they put upon their heads as diadems, and, adorning their waists with plumes of various colours, they, thus decked, celebrate their festivals and drunken entertainments. Then it is they assert that the devil is accustomed to appear, though only to the oldest drunkards, in the dress of a Spaniard, when he is so good as to reveal to them future events. They, nevertheless, have no kind of religious observance, being entirely atheists ; and being fully persuaded that, when they die, all is finished. They are yet very superstitious, and believe that the singing of birds, the howling of dogs, &c. are prognostics of cither good or evil that will await them ; and by these they uniformly direct their actions. The warriors are interred standing, but others in a recumbent posture. Like the other Indians, these do not put into the grave of the defunct eatables, &c. ; but they abstain from touching the arms of those who die in war, as well as from passing the place where their misfortune happened, considering it a bad augury so to do. They celebrate in the dawn of many days successvely the exequies of the defunct with great howlings and lamentations, and after this he is no more remembered. Amongst these Indians are found some caciques, whose names have a strong resemblance to the Judean names, such as Jonais, Jonapain, Jonastete, and Jonaiso ; and from thence some have endeavoured to prove the population of America from the Hebrews. The governor of Tucuman, Don Esteban deUrizar, made a peace with these Indians, and obtained that they should ceme to Buenos Ayres to be instructed in the Catholic faith; but we find, that passing through the city of Santiago del Estero, they rose against the Spaniards, put many to death, and returned to their territory : the greater part, however, settled at Buenos Ayres. The Father Pedro Lozano, of the   *r*M  pw  MAL  company of (he Jesuits, says, tbat the nation of these Malbalas or Malbalaes consisted of upwards of 500,000 souls.

Its situation is on the skirt of the sierra of Topia. It is of a mild temperature; and although it does not yield wheat, produces maize in abundance, besides honey and wax made by the swarms of bees found in its mountains, the same being the principal and almost only branch of the commerce of its inhabitants. These are few, owing to the reduced state of the population, which consists of only four settlements of Mexican Indians, of one real of some mines, from whence some silver is obtained, and also of some estates, in which there are some small breeds of cattle. It was anciently part of the alcaldia mayor of Tepeguana ; but this latter being considered of sufficient extent by itself, the former was separated from it about 70 years since, and made an alcaldia mayor by itself, though at the same time considered as one of the least lucrative in the whole kingdom. The capital is the real of mines of Santa Rita.

Malpais, a province in the llanos of San Juan, of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada ; discovered by Jorge de Spira in 1536, who gave it this name, on account of its being a barren, uneven, and mountainous country. It was thinly inhabited with Indians.

It is composed almost entirely of stone, and in it are two very lofty peaks. It is barren, 80 leagues distant from the gulf of Panama, in the kingdom of Tierra Firme, in lat. 4° 48' n. In navigating these parts, it is necessary 'to keep clear of this island, as it is of that of Gorgona, from which it is difficult to steer clear, owing to the very strong currents and contrary winds ; and thus, when a vessel is caught in this manner, it is called engorgonarse, or to be engulphed; but, indeed, of two evils it is certainly more convenient to suffer this misfortune, which at the worst only retards the voyage, than to run to certain destruction on the island of Mal-Pelo.

Maltrata, a sierra, which is the Nevada or Snowy, in the Uanuras of Perote and Azumpan in Nueva Espana. The Spaniards gave it this name, from their having been illtreated here on its discovery. The Indians, in their language, are called Poyauhtecati. This sierra is very lofty, and may be seen 30 leagues at sea, and serves as a landmark, being the first land seen before the sierras of San Martin. It is 20 leagues distant from the coast, vomits smoke, and according to Diego Munoz, once, for 10 years, never smoked at all. The Indians used to assert in their ancient songs, that when these sierras should vomit smoke, there would be great mortalities and plagues. In fact, in 1545, there really did happen the plague, which afflicted the kingdom, and in which an infinite number of souls perished, though not without the said mountains having first ominously vomited much smoke, and continuing to do the same for 20 years ; after which time they ceased, save at intervals, when a little smoke was seen to rise.

==[[Malvinas|MALVINAS|Falkland Isles]]==, of the sea of Magellan, discovered by some French of S. Malo in 1706, who gave them this name, and afterwards called by the English, Falkland. They lie to the e. of the straits of Magellan, and are 180 miles from cape San Juan, and 315 from cape Horn. Their number is not rightly ascertained : the largest of them was reconnoitred in 1764 by the French captain Luis de Bouganville, who gave it and the port his name; and having discovered that the latter was very good, he established a colony there, the same having been subsequently ceded to the king of Spain, who claimed it as his right. This island extends about 75 miles. In 1767, it was taken possession of by the governor Don Felipe Ruiz Puente, a naval captain, and knight of the order of Santiago, the same having been nominated by the king. He was succeeded in his office by Don Francisco Gil y Lemus, knight of the order of San Juan, and who was also at the time a naval captain, and afterwards rearadmiral of the royal armada. These islands are full of swamps ; the climate and territory are very bad for the plants and fruits of Europe or America, the cold being excessive. [The Falkland isles lie between lat. 51° 5' and 52° 46' s. Long. 57° 40' and 61° 10' w. The soil of these islands is bad, and the shores are beaten by perpetual storms.

MAMALUCOS. See San Pablo. 
Mamalucos, or Mamelucos, some Mustees of the kingdom of Brazil, inhabitants of the province and colony of San Pablo, whose origin is as follows : The Portuguese, the conquerors of Brazil, after that they had founded the city of San Vicente on the seacoast, detached from thence some colonies to form other settlements ; and amongst the most celebrated of these was San Pablo, the same being in the canton which the natives of the country call De la Piratininga. A short time after this, arrived the Father Manuel Nobrega, of the abolished order of the Jesuits, first provincial, sent by San lgnacio de Loyola ; and he, considering this settlement as a most convenient place for founding a mission for the Indians, transferred hither the college which he had founded at San Vicente, on the evening of the conversion of St. Paul, in 1554, dedicating to this apostle of the gentiles this new college, the same being from that lime forward called San Pablo de Piratinanga. The inhabitants, with the succour of the Jesuits, preserved for a considerable time a very orderly and decent behaviour, and the Indians, seeing that these religious brethren were the sureties for all good treatment at the hands of the Portuguese, easily embraced the Catholic faith; but their virtue was of short duration, and the colony of San Pablo de Piratininga, in which the missionaries had founded the greatest expectations, proved to be the greatest of all their obstacles to their spiritual conquests, and such as they could never after surmount. The evil communicated itself with a neighbouring colony, in which the Portuguese were living mixed amongst the Indians ; and finally, from a mixture of the Indians of San Pablo was produced a perverse race of Musteest who were addicted to all kinds ofdisorderly ways,. and who were called Mamelucos, from their rev' semblance to the ancient slaves of the Egyptian sultans. In spite of the endeavours of the governors, magistrates, the Jesuits, and the ecclesiastical judges to restrain the progress of the growing evil, the bonds of reconciliation became daily more relaxed, and the Mamelucos at once appeared a race who trampled upon all divine and human authority. Indeed, their numbers continued to be greatly increased by a vast accession of refugees of various nations, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, and Dutch ; the same having fled from the justice 3 K

BBBP!  MAM  that awaited their crimes. These, being joined by some Brazilian Indians, and all of them being enamoured with a sense of liberty, gave themselves up to every kind of vice, and spread themselves over a large tract of country. There was now nothing more desirable than the total' extirpation of these lawless people, and the same was equally an object of importance to the crowns of Spain and Portugal ; but the situation of the city of San Pablo, as it was upon the top a rock, prevented it from being conquered, save by famine ; and even to effect this, no small supply of troops would have been necessary, and these could not at the time be spared either from Brazil or Paraguay : add to this, that the city might have held a strong conflict with only a few determined defenders. The principal cause, however, why steps were not taken against the Mamelucos, were that they never left their own territory, being much attached to it from its fertility, the great abundance of all the necessaries of life, and the pureness of the air, the sky being always serene and the climate temperate, notwithstanding that it is situate in lat. 24° s. Thelandsare fertile, and produce very good wheat, the sugarcane grows in abundance, and the pastures are very fine. When we consider these advantages, it must be evident that nothing but an innate love of mischief could induce these people to encounter imminent dangers and fatigues, in traversing those spacious regions, which they depopulated of more than two millions of souls, suffering in their excursions, which oftentimes lasted for two years, the most miserable life, many of them perishing, and many finding, on their return, their wives married to others. Indeed, in all probability, they would by these means have become extinct, were not their numbers regularly replenished by the captives which they made in their wars. The great ascendancy which the Mamelucos had gained, was not less through the fault of the Spaniards of Paraguay than of the Indians ; for had the Spaniards not been remiss in aiding the converted settlements to throw off the bondage under which they were held by the Ma- "nielucos, these would never have prevailed as they did : but the Spaniards were blinded by a false interest, and looked upon these new churches as a barrier opposed to their avaricious views ; nor were they aware of their error until they discovered their fine frontier entirely ruined and depopulated. The Mamelucos discovered a greater spirit of resistance amongst the newmade Christians, than they expected, and finding themselves unable to destroy them, they had recourse to art and stratagem. One of these, which they practised for  a long time with great effect, was as follows: They divided themselves into small parties, and the commander of each being dressed as a Jesuit, and being aware, from the crosses that had been stuck up in different parts by these fathers, of the places where they should find their prey, they began to introduce themselves to the attention of the Indians by making presents, curing their infirmities, and exhorting them to persevere in the faith they had been taught, or explaining to them in a few words the principal articles f and this they had a facility of doing, in as much as they were acquainted with the Guarani language. When by these means they had drawn together a considerable number, they proposed to them that they should go and settle in some more convenient spot, wherenothing might be wanting to them. The greater part would suffer themselves to be seduced by these wolves covered in sheep's clothing, Avhen, the traitors dropping the mask, would seize upon their victims, and put those to death who offered resistance or attempted to fly. This stratagem was discovered by some who effected a return to their country ; but in the mean time the Indians were persuaded that the authors of these atrocities were truly Jesuits, so that the real fathers of this order were constantly in dread of their lives, nor could they, for a considerable number of years, make a single proselyte. In 1630, the Mamelucos destroyed various settlements of the missions, and in the following year the Villarica and Ciudad Real of Spaniards; but in 1641, in another irruption that they made, the Neofitos Indians sided with the converted settlements, and succeeded in routing the common enemy, who lost upwards of 12,000 men. In 1645, the Mamelucos made another invasion against the Itatincs, when the Father Francisco Arias, the missionary, met with his death. In 1694, they entered the territory of the Chiquitos Indians, and were routed, which damped their spirits ; and after this time, for the purpose of greater security, it was allowed by the king that the Indians of the missions might carry firearms.

==[[Manacicas|MANACICAS]]==, a nation of Indians of the province and government of Paraguay in Peru, reduced at present to the Catholic faith. In the time of its gentilism it was composed of 22 villages, which formed as many other different cantons, independent of each other, and each having its own peculiar title, and the inhabitants of the first being called Igritucas, of the second Sibacas, &c. The country which this nation then occupied is two days journey to the n. of the settlement of the missions, called San Francisco Xavier, at the n. extremity of the country of the Chiquitos Indians. It forms the figure of a pyramid, the base being towards the s. ; and what is most singular is, that in this, nation dwell other Indians, who are perfectly distinct from the Manacicas. This country is irrigated by many rivers, and is surrounded by woods, which extend for a great space from e. to w. and are so thick as to be impenetrable to the sun. Beyond these woods are large deserts, for the most part inundated. The territory produces many fruits without cultivation ; and the vaynilla is here equally common with a kind of palm totally distinct from that generally known, and the fruit of which is as large as a melon, and fixed to the trunk similar to the cocos. Amongst the animals of this country is one called famocosio, which has the head of a tiger, the body "of a mastiff', and is without any tail, of an activity and ferocity unequalled. When attacked by this animal, it is impossible to avoid being torn to pieces, excepting you have the good fortune to be able to mount a tree for security ; though even this will not always avail, for the animal, not being able to climb, erects itself on its hindlegs and  makes a roaring noise, whereupon others of its own class arrive and begin to root up the tree, and very quickly bring it to the ground ; accordingly, if the person pursued should happen not to have any arrows, with which he may kill these animals whilst thus employed, he is sure to become their victim. That this dreadful beast may not multiply, the Manacicas have invented means to destroy them, and one is as follows: Many Indians, after having surrounded themselves with palisades or strong paling, will make a noise to entice to them the famocosios, and while these are occupied in rooting up the palisades to get at their prey, the Indians kill them with, their arrows. The Moposicas, who formed one of the most powerful cantons of the nation, were not so fortunate in ridding themselves of an enemy, though less formidable, the gavilan or sparrowhawk, which used to pounce upon them with such fury as generally to kill them before they had time to prepare themselves for defence ; and we are assured, that this little animal alone depopulated the whole canton. The Manacicas are well made, of a dingy colour, and are subject to a kind of leprosy, which covers the whole of their body with a scurf resembling the scale of fish, though the same is attended with no pain or inconvenience whatever. They are of the same origin as are the Chiquitos Indians, and were separated from them by some civil wars ; and again, their commerce with other nations has so changed their idiom that these two nations no longer understand each other's language : indeed the only thing which they still retain in common of their origin is their valour. Idolatry, which was unknown to the Chiquitos, has been introduced amongst the Mailacinas, together with the barbarous custom of eating human flesh ; but it is not known from whence they have derived their deities, or what is the worship they pay them. The towns or settlements are very handsome ; the streets are wide and straight, having various public places, and three or four large houses divided into saloons and chambers, the latter for the lodging of the caciques, the former for the public assemblies and the ceremonies to their deities, since they have no other temples. All these places are built of well-Avrought wood, notwithstanding that they have no other instruments than the hatchet and flintstones. The villages were at but a small distance from each other, and at the festivals drunkenness was universal. In the assemblies the cacique had the first place, the mapono the second, and the physician the third; in the fourth rank were the captains, and then followed the others successively in their order. To the caciques an absolute and blind obe-  dience was paid, and their vassals repaired for them their houses, cultivated their fields, provided their tables with the best food that could be procured, and paid them a poletax. The caciques were alone allowed to have many wives, though they permitted to one alone the honour of being so considered ; and this honour consisted in her receiving the same obedience and the like good offices from the women of the settlement as the cacique himself received from the men. She also received with her husband a tribute, which Avas reduced to a tax of licences for fishing and hunting, no one being permitted, without these grants, to exercise the said employments. The dignity of the cacique was hereditary, and the presumptive heir had an absolute authority over all the unmarried young men, in order to exercise himself in the art of governing ; and when he became sufficiently experienced, it was usual for the father to resign in his favour, when, although he, no longer mixed in affairs, he was continually treated with the highest veneration, and, when he died, deposited with great funeral pomp in a cavern, the entrance of which was firmly closed and cemented. This nation was very superstitious. It had a tradition, that the apostle St. Thomas preached the gospel in their country. Certain it is, that in the midst of gross and impious fables and monstrous dogmas, they discovered traits of Christianism, since they had an idea of a God who was made man for the salvation of the human race ; and further, one of their traditions was, that a very beautiful woman conceived without knowing man, and brought forth a malechild, who afterwards performed vast prodigies, raising the dead, curing the  
MAN  deaf, giving sight to the blind.  and who, having collected together in one society a numerous party, raised himself up into the air, and became transformed into the sun which gives us light. Also the mapones assert, that were the sun not so far from them, he would distinguish their different military exploits. These Indians used to pay worship to the devil, who, they affirm, has appeared to them under the most horrible shapes; they acknowledged an infinite number of deities, but they distinguish three superior to the rest, which formed a trinity, composed of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. To the first they gave two names, which were Omequaturipui and Uragosorio, the second they called Urasana, and the third Urasso. The wife of the father was Quipoci, who, without loss of her virginal integrity, was the mother of Urasana. The father, they said, spoke in a clear and high tone of voice, the son through the nose, and the holy ghost was to be heard like thunder. 1  
Quipoci was at times resplendent to behold ; the father was the god of justice, who chastised the wicked ; and the sou, the mother, and the holy ghost, filled the office of intercessors and mediators ; moreover, these three divinities bad one common name, which was Tiniamacus. The father Lucas Caballero, of the abolished order of Jesuits, entered to preach the gospel to these Indians, in 1706, and reduced them to the faith, forming them into different settlements; the same having formed a principal part of the converted settlements of Paraguay. 

==[[Managua|MANAGUA]]==, a settlement of the province and kinpdom of Nicaragua. 
==[[Manahatan|MANAHATAN]]==, an island of the N. sea; situate at the entrance of the river which traverses the province of New York in N. America. Here the Dutch founded the city of New Amsterdam ; the name of which the English afterwards converted into New York. This island is 15 miles long and one wide; it is very fertile, and abounds in fruits of the best quality, and at moderate prices. The advantage of its having in it the capital of the province, renders it a place important both from its population and its commerce.

==[[Manare|MANARE]]==, a settlement of the province and government of San Juan de los Llanos, in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada ; founded upon the river Ariporo, upon a lofty, spacious, and pleasant tableland. It consists of Cocatios Indians, who formerly called it Pauto, and it is of the best temperature of any place in the province ; since, from its lofty situation, it experiences less heat, and is consequently very healthy : besides this, it has all the fruits of the other settlements, and from its mildness produces figs, cabbages, lettuces, and different sorts of pulse not to be met with in the settlements of the llanos. It likewise produces cotton, of which are fabricated many various and curious woven articles. The natives also make pitchers, pots, and other vases, of beautiful workmanship, the same being much valued at Santa Fe and other parts. It is 138 miles n. e. of Santa Fe, in lat. 5° 46' n. Long. 72° 14' w. 
MANAT1, a settlement of the province and government of Cartagena in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada ; situate on the shore of the channel of the Dique.

==[[Mancapra|MANCAPRA]]==, a river of the province and government of Venezuela, in the territory which divides this jurisdiction from that of Cumana. It forms in its midcourse a large lake, and then runs to enter the Guarico, about 28 miles before this river enters the Orinoco. 
[==[[Mancenilla|MANCENILLA]]==, a large bay on the n. side of the island of St. Domingo ; about 4000 fathoms long from w. to e. and 2800 broad from n. to s. The s. e. part of the bay is very wide, and affords excellent anchorage, even for vessels of the first size. In other parts it is too shallow. The river Massacre, which was the point of separation of the French and Spanish colonies on the n. of the island, runs a n. course, towards its mouth n. w. and enters the e. part of the bay. The bay of Mancenilla, though a very fine one, is not so useful as it might be, if its bottom were well known. There are several shallows in it, owing to the overflowings of the Massacre, which rolls .into it wood, sand, and stones, in great quantities; so that it seems necessary to sound the bay annually, after they are over. In general, it is prudent, on entering, to keep closer to the point of Ycaque, than to the s. side of the bay, because the sandy point has no rocks. The bottom of the bay is muddy. The river Massacre is, during a league, from five to 12 feet deep, and prelty wide; but its bed is often full of the wood which the current brings down. It swarms with fish ; and here are found those enormous mullets which are the pride of the table at cape Francois. In the times of the floods, these fish are driven towards the bay, where Negroes, well practised in the business, fish for them. Fishing in the bay is difficult enough, on account of the drifted wood ; but the Negroes are good divers, and are often obliged to go to the bottom and disengage the seine; but when it gets near the beach, it is a singular and striking spectacle, to see the Negroes, the fish, and the alligators, all flouncing about in the water together. The Negroes kill the alligators, knock out their teeth, and sell them to make corals, the garniture of which serves to mark the degree of luxury or pride of  those who hang them to the necks of their children. The plenty offish often attracts ships of war to this bay. The mouth of Massacre river lies in lat. 19° 50' n. Long. 71° 50'©.] 
==[[Mancera|MANCERA]]==, an island of the kingdom of Chile, near the coast of the province and government of Valdivia, at the entrance of the river of this name.

It has a magnificent parish church, and a good castle to defend the entrance of the river, which was improved and completed by the brigadier Don Manuel Amat, in his presidency. Both the castle and the settlement maintain the same name as the island. 
[==[[Manchac|MANCHAC]]==, a town on the Missisippi, two miles below the Indian town of Alabama. The banks of the river at Manchac, though frequently overflowed by vernal inundations, are 50 feet perpendicular height above the surface of the water ; and the river, at its lowest ebb, is not less than 40 fathoms deep, and nearly a mile in width. The Spanish fortress on the point of land below the Ibberville, close by the banks of the river, has a communication with Manchac, by a slender, narrow, wooden bridge, across the channel of Ibberville, and not a bowshot from the habitations of Manchac] Manchac, Canal of, in the province and government of Louisiana.

Accorded o ly, at the instance of the president of that kingdom, the provincial of the order of St. Domingo dispatched on this errand the fathers Fr. Juan de Esquerra, and Fr. Salvador Cipriano, who reduced many of these infidels to the faith, and founded eight settlements.

==[[Manciche|MANCICHE]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Truxillo in Peru ; situate in a beautiful and spacious valley called De Chirno. It was a population of Indians from the time of their gentilism, and after the arrival of the Spaniards, the number of its inhabitants increased so greatly that they amounted to upwards of 3000 persons ; the same having collected for the most part from different quarters of the said valley. It is at present reduced to a very scanty population of Indians, who employ themselves in raising pulse ■ for the consumption of the capital, to which the settlement lies very close. 
==[[Mancora|MANCORA]]==, a large strand of the district of Tumbez, in the province and corregimiento of Piura in Peru.

Repeated visitations of the smallpox, aided by frequent attacks of the Sioux, have reduced them to their present number. They claim no particular tract of country. They live in fortified villages, hunt immediately in their neighbourhood, and cultivate corn, beans, squashes, and tobacco, which form articles of traffic with their neighbours the Assinniboin : they also baiter horses with the Assinniboins for arms, ammunition, axes, kettles, and other articles of European manufacture ; these last they obtain from the British establishments on the Assinniboin river. The articles which they thus obtain from the Assinniboins and the British traders who visit them, they again exchange for horses and leather tents with the Crow Indians, Chyennes, Wetepahatoes, Kiawas, Kanenavich, Stactan, and Cataka, who visit them occasionally for the purpose of traffic. Their trade may be much increased. Their country is similar to that of the Ricaras, Population increasing.] 

MAND1NGA, a small settlement of the province and government of Panama, and kingdom of Tierra Firme. It is situate on the shore of the river of this name, near its entrance into the sea, upon the height of a mountain, where there is a watchtower or signalhouse, to give notice to the governor of Panama of the vessels that may appear. 
Manmnga. The aforesaid river rises in the mountains of Chepo, and runs e. until that it enters the bay, to which it gives its name. Its course is only four leagues, and its navigation is prohibited on pain of death, from the ease with which, by this means, a pass might be effected into the S. sea ; the same having actually been put into execution, in 1679, by the pirates John Guarlem, Edward Blomen, and Bartholomew C harps. 
Handing A. The aforesaidbay, which is on the coast of the province and government of Darien, and theN. sea, is large, handsome, and sheltered. It is 10 leagues wide, and somewhat more long. It is full of small isles, as well in its centre as on either side of its coasts.

[==[[Manetopa|MANETOPA]]==, Oseegah, Mahtopanato, Indians of N. America, descendants of the Sioux, and partake of their turbulent and faithless disposition : they frequently plunder, and sometimes murder their own traders. The name by which this nation is generally known was borrowed from the Chippeways, who call them Assinniboan, which literally translated is Stone Sioux ; hence the name of Stone Indians, by which they are sometimes called. The country in which they rove is almost entirely uncovered with timber, lies extremely level, and is but badly watered in many parts ; the land, however, is tolerably fertile and unencumbered with stone. They might be induced to trade at the river Yellow Stone ; but we do not think that their trade promises much. Their numbers continue about the same. These bands, like the Sioux, act entirely independent of each other, although they claim a national affinity, and never make war on each other. The country inhabited by the Mahtopanato possesses rather more timber than the other parts of the country. They do not employ themselves in cultivating the land.]

==[[Mano|MANO]]==, a river of the district of Babahoyo, in the province and government of Guayaquil, and kingdom of Quito. It enters by the s. into the Oxiba, in lat. 1° 36' s. 
==[[Manoa|MANOA]]==, a fabulous and imaginary city, called also Dorado, and which has existed only in the maps of certain geographers, who were equally wanting of information and of sense, and in the ideas of certain impostors, who by their inventions have deceived very many Spaniards and English. They place it on the w. shore of the lake Parime, and at the mouth of a great river which empties itself into this lake, pretending that it is exceedingly large, rich, and populous. This fable began to gain credit in 1534, and many were the stories invented by Juan Martinez, a Spaniard, who, amongst other things, asserted that he had lived a long time in this country, and that he left it by the permission of the chief who commanded it, and who was descended from the ancient Incas of Peru; that this same chief gave orders that he should be accompanied by Indians till he reached the Spanish frontiers ; that they took care to lead him blindfold, lest that he might observe the way by which to return ; with several other things equally vague and foolish, but so as to induce at first many expeditions to this fairreputed city, at the expence of large sums of money and many lives. Although the Jesuit Gumilla, in his " Orinoco lllustrado," agrees to the existence of this city, yet the falsity of his ideas have been lately most clearly evinced, by the statement of the admiral Don Joseph de    MAN  
MAN  Iturriaga, and by the information acquired by the [Mansfield, a township in Burlington county, missionaries of San Francisco from the Indians, as New Jersey, on the s. side of Black's creek, consisting of 19,000 acres, of an excellent soil, noted for its fine pastures and large dairies. It is eight miles w. by n. of Burlington, and 12 s. by e. of  may be seen in the History of Nueva Andalucia, by the Father Fr. Antonio Caulin. Juan Janson io, who also held this country to be fabulous, placed it in his map of Guayana, three miles from lake Parime, in lat. 1° 54' s. [But this is certainly erroneous, as it is, at all events, n. of the line four or five degrees.] 
Manoa, a settlement of the missions held by the monks of San Francisco in the province and corregimiento of Caxamarquilla, and kingdom of Peru, the same being the only one in this part which they reduced in 1763 ; though even this at the expence of the life of one ot those missionaries, who was shot by an arrow from the Indians. From this settlement the missionaries made a further entry into the interior of the mountainous parts in 1764, and met with a nation of infidel Indians, who gave indications of being easily converted, and of affording an opportunity of extending still farther the blessings of the divine faith. In this settlement are 350 Indians.

Near it is a very fertile estate called Nirihue. Manso, Llanos de, some extensive llanuras of the kingdom of Peru, in the province of Chaco ; surrounded by the rivers Pilcomayo and Bermejo. They stretch out for many leagues, and are inhabited by many nations of Indians. They have their name from Captain Andres Manso, who founded here the city of Santiago de Guadalcazar, which was destroyed by the infidels. See article Chaco. 

==[[Manta|MANTA]]==, a settlement of the district of Puerto Viejo, in the province and government of Guayaquil, and kingdom of Quito, founded by Francisco Pacheco in 1535. It has a good port, much frequented by vessels, which go backwards and forwards between Peru and Tierra Firme, to take in water from a small river which runs from a place called Toalla, the said water being of the colour of mastich, but very sweet and wholesome. In the principal church is venerated a very miraculous image of Nuestra Scfiora de Monserrat, and vessels at entering and leaving the port make a salute, and sing the Litany in honour of the Blessed Virgin, whom this image represents. In this port are three particular places, called Salango, Salanguillo, and El Morro, abounding in all kinds of shellfish of excellent quality, and which are washed up by the sea ; and in the last century, (1700), there were some fisheries of pearls as fine as any of those found in Margarita or the Rio del Hacha ; but these fisheries were abandoned, from the number of divers who perished, being suffocated by the fish called mania, which abounds here, and gives the name to the settlement. This fish is of the figure of a mantle, of three or four yards long and two wide ; it is about a yard thick, and so inimical to man, that it darts at the unfortunate diver immediately that he submerges, and so envelops and devours him. Some have escaped by carrying with them a sharp twoedged knife, with 3 l 2    w**-*imz*  MAN  which to divide the enemy, and so extricate themselves from its embrace ; but these are very few. This settlement has been taken several times by strange pirates, and it was on this account removed to the foot of a hill, where it now stands, bearing the name of Monte Cliristi or Manta la Nueva. La Matiniere says, that it is nine leagues from the bay of Caracas, meaning Cara, from whence, however, it is 10 : he then names the river, Choropoto, instead of Charopoto, asserting that vessels going from Panama to Peru touch at this port, in order that those who are going to Lima may disembark here and proceed by land ; in all of which he is, as in general, erroneous ; since it would be egregious folly to disembark at Manta, in order to make a circuitous route to Guayaquil, then toembark here for Tumbez, and so to pass by land to Piura. It is evident that he took Manta for Paita,a port on the coast of Peru, where those who proceed by land to Lima disembark. Again, the exjesuit Coleti, in attempting to do away this error, falls into that of asserting, that no vessel going to Peru ever touches at Manta, although, as we have before observed, it is common for vessels so to do, for the purpose of taking in water. Some assert, that in its vicinity was a famous mine of emeralds, from whence the Indians extracted one so large as to induce them to adore it as a deity, many coming from distant parts for this purpose. 
The ancient Mantas were excessive voluptuaries and sodomites. At present their numbers are greatly diminished, and all of them are reduced to the Catholic faith. The Mantas in ancient times used also to adore the sea, and fishes, tigers, lions, snakes, and insects ; but above all, the emerald beforementioned, which was kept in the valley of Manta, and said to be as large as an ostrichegg : this they used to expose to public admiration on their festival days, presenting to it other emeralds of less size, a practice which the priests and the cacique Manta would maintain was highly acceptable to the object of their adoration, since this considered the small emeralds as its daughters. The Spaniards consequently found, on their arrival, great quantites of these stones, though they could never procure a sight of the large one, the Indians having taken particular care to conceal it. In their matrimonial alliances they had the barbarous custom, that the relations and friends of the bridegroom should anticipate the privileges of the husband. The prisoners that they took in war they fleed, and filling their skins with ashes, so as that they should appear in their perfect form, they suspended them in their temples and places wherein  they celebrated their festivals, as trophies of their victories. The Inca Htiayna Capac intimated to them that he expected they should submit themselves to his empire, or otherwise that he should oblige them by force. These Indians, for some time, withstood the Inca's power; but although they were not without allies to support them in their views of independence, they were at last obliged to submit themselves under his dominion. The settlement is 18 miles from Puerto Viejo, 88 from Guayaquil, and If from the S.sea; in Int. 58' 5^. and lone 80° 26' w,

Its territory, although formerly inhabited by many barbarian nations of Indians, such as the Tobosos, Gavilanes, Tripas Blancas, Jacarillas, and others, is peopled now only with a mixture of all these, who are dispersed, and consist of the apostates, who fly from the missions and interior garrisons, and come to occupy the deserts for the purpose of carrying on the trade of a banditti. There were formerly in this presidio or garrison some abundant silver mines, which were worked to great profit, and were the residence of an alcaldia mayor; but at present they cease to be useful.

[==[[Mapleton|MAPLETON]]==, a name given to a pleasant range of excellent farms, three miles e. of Princeton in New Jersey.] 
==[[Mapocho|MAPOCHO]]==, a river of the province and corregimiento of Santiago in the kingdom of Chile. It rises from the Cordillera of the Andes, runs w. leaves the city of Santiago, where it is also known by this name, and, being divided into many streamlets and pools, it irrigates and fertilizes the surrounding country, and the spacious llanura of its name, which is 10 leagues long and 10 wide, deserting its native channel. Shortly after this, it    44!>  hides itself beneath the ground, and forms above it, as it were, a bridge for a distance of more than three leagues ; and when it appears again, gushes out, apparently boiling, from amidst some sedges, and its waters appear as clear as crystal. Two leagues from this spot it has upon its banks an ancient and beautiful convent of the religious order of San Francisco, which, from its immediation to some extensive woods, is called San Francisco del Monte, and is one of the first convents founded in that kingdom. This river afterwards enters the Maipo. [The Mapocho gives its name to certain Indians ; for an account of whom, see Index to additional History of Chile, Chap. II.]

[==[[Maquoit|MAQUOIT]]==, a bay of shoal waters in Casco bay, in the district of Maine, about 18 miles n. e. of cape Elizabeth, frequently mentioned in the history of Maine ; where the Indians were used to land with their canoes, and from thence carry them to Pejebscot falls on Androscoggin river. This was done with the toil of only four hours walk. From these falls they went down into Kennebeck liver ; and from thence continued their route up that river to Wesserunsett, and thence over to St. Lawrence; or turned and went down through Monseag bay, towards Penobscot; or from the falls they continued their progress up Androscoggin river, beyond the White mountains, and over to Connecticut river, and from thence to lake Memphremagog, and down to the limits of Canada.] 
MAR Atlantico, or Atlantic Ocean, a sea of very large extent, but of uncertain limits, in as much as geographers do not agree in affixing them. We, however, consider it as occupying the space lying between the Canary and Cape Verde isles, opposite the coast of Africa, as far as the equinoctial line, that is to say, lat. 30° n. and long. 50°, as far as the Lesser Antilles, and the coast of the Dutch and French colonies ; from which point we distinguish the ocean by the Mar del N. or N. sea, in order to avoid any confusion in the description of ports, capes, islands, &c. 
Mar Austral, Meridional or Antarctic Sea, which begins in the straits of Magellan, and extends as far as the Antarctic pole, encompassing the extreme land of America or the Tierra del Fuego, and being determined by an imaginary line drawn from e. to w. above the aforesaid strait. It is distinguished from the sea of Magellan and the Pacific, or more properly from the Chilian sea. At the beginning of this century. (1800), its navi-   gation began to be frequented by the French, and the strait of Magellan was abandoned as a pass into the S. sea. Some fix its polar limits at the Tierra Austral or De Quiros, but nothing has been with certainty determined. 
Mar Brazilico, or Brazilian Sea, which washes the coasts of the kingdom of Brazil, beginning at the mouth or entrance of the river Maranon under the equinoctial line, and terminating in the mouth of the river La Plata, in lat. 35° 30' s. and towards the e. in the first meridian, taken in the island of Ferro, according to the determination of King Luis XIII. of France, in 1634. In it is found the island of Los Picos, the last belonging to America, under the same tropic of Capricorn. ° 
Mar Chileno, or Sea of Chile, begins at the w. mouth of the straits of Magellan, in lat. 52° 49' s. and terminates in the island of San Ambrosio in lat. §5° s. ; laves all the coast of the kingdom of Chile, and that of Los Patagones. This sea is also comprehended under the name of the Pacific, and some geographers will call it the S. sea, the same as they do the Peruvian sea. 
Mar Magallanico, or Sea of Magellan. Its limits are, n. by the mouth of the river La Plata, in lat. 35° 30' s. where it is bounded by the Brazilico or Brazilian sea, s. by the e. mouth of the straits of Magellan, in lat. 52° 21' s. and beinothus divided from the S. sea. It laves the coasts of Las Pampas and the Tierras Magallanicas. 
Mar del Norte, or North Sea. As this sea respects S. America, it extends from the coast of the isthmus of Panama, or of Tierra Firme, that is to say, from 294° long, as far as the Lesser Antilles, in 318° long.; laves the coast of Nueva Andalucia, Venezuelaj Santa Marta, Cartagena Darien, and Tierra Firme. It extends n. as far as lat. 18° n. and is distinguished by an imaginary line drawn from n. e. to s. w. that is, from the island of St. Thomas, the last of the Little Antilles, to the n. as far as the mouth or entrance of the river Chagre. 
^ Mar Pacifico, or Pacific Sea, called also South Sea, or Del Su r. This, speaking more properly, should, with regard toAmerica, be called W. sea. Vasco Nunez, a Portuguese, and Nuno de Balboa, a Spaniard, were the first who discovered and came into this sea in 1512, and not in 1503, as according to Martiniere. With respect to S. America, it extends from the straits of Magellan, as far as the isthmus of Panama or Tierra Firme lat. 66° 46' 48" ; that is, lat. 52° 49' s. and lat. 8° 57' 48" n. which make somewhat more than 1286 leagues. It extends from e. to w. as far as the Solomon isles, the which are at an uncertain dis-  m  tance, their longitude not having yet been justly determined. It takes the name of Pacific from the frequency of the calms which reign in different parts of it. Both the Chilian and the Peruvian sea form part of the Pacific. 
Mar Peruano, or Peruvian Sea, is part of the Pacific, extending from the island of San Ambrosia as far as White cape, from lat. 4° 1o 25° s. that is to say, an extent of 21° or 420 leagues. It laves the coasts of Peru, and its currents from s. to n. are very rapid. 
Mar Peruano, with the addition of Chiquito, a lake on the coast which lies between the river La Plata and the straits of Magellan, close to cape De Lobos. 

==[[Mara|MARA]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Cotabambas in Peru. Mara, a settlement of the missions that were held by the Carmelite fathers of Portugual in the country of Las Amazonas ; situate on the shore of the river Negro. 

==[[Marabi|MARABI]]==, or, according to others, Marahi, a lake of the province and government of Guayana, near the limits which divide this province from the territory of the Portuguese. It empties itself by a considerable and copious arm into the river Yarupa. 
==[[Maraca|MARACA]]==, an island of the province and country of Las Amazonas ; situate near the coast, close to the N. cape. 
MARACA I, a settlement of the province and government of Venezuela in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada ; situate on the shore of the lake Tacarigua or De Valencia, on the n. part. 
"[The village of Maracai, on the e. part of the lake of Valencia, is situated in the famous valley of Anagua, sufficiently near the lake to enjoy all its benefits, and far enough off to avoid the insalubrious effects. ■ The sandy soil renders it healthy but cold. This village, what thirty years ago would hardly deserve the name of hamlet, is a most enchanting spot. Threefourths of the houses are built with composition, and are as elegant as they are strong and solid : they appear to be all of the same, and that a very recent, date. The streets are not paved ; this is perceptible when the sand is blown about by the wind, and incommodes the sight. A new, spacious, and regular building serves as a parish church : the only clerical person is a curate, and the only civil authority is represented by a magistrate, who is a justice of peace, and of easy access. 
The inhabitants of this village, to the number of 8400, have no little claim to our admiration ; they are not infected with the pride of ancestry, nor  

MAR  the vanity, of distinction. Industry and activify form the basis of their affections, and a forhmata spirit of emulation renders agriculture the reigning passion among them. Numerous plantations of cotton, indigo, coffee, corn, &c. made with judgment and worked with care, at once proclaim their industry, and are the cause of their prosperity. These are also found scattered all over the province of Aragua. Whether the traveller enters this country by Valencia, or by the mountains of San Pedro, which separate it from Caracas, he fancies himself transported into another nation, and into a land possessed by a people the most industrious and agricultural. His eye surveys the valley extending 15 leagues from e. to w. and beholds the land richly covered with colonial produce, artificially watered, and having watermills and superb buildings erected by the industrious people for the manufacture and preparation of the fruits of their labour. The free people, who every where else, are listless, inactive, and indolent, are here found to be laborious, and for moderate daily wages ; and thus the planter has occasion for but a few slaves, and these merely for domestic uses.] 

==[[Maracaibo|MARACAIBO|Nueva Zamora]]==, a city of the province of Venezuela and Nuevo Reynp de Granada, founded on the shore of the lake of its name, by Captain Alonso Pacheco, in 1571, and not by Ambrosio de Alfinger, in 1530, as according to Coleti. It is of an extremely hot temperature, but healthy. It is so dry that for upwards of 20 leagues towards the serrania there is no other water than such as is obtained artificially from the rain, and preserved in xahueyes or wells dug for the purpose ; the same furnishing with drink the cattle which graze in this country. Indeed the lands of this district are beginning to be somewhat barren, although through the conveniences offered to trade by the lake, there is no want of necessaries ; but these are, on the contrary, brought from other cities and settlements. The buildings are of stone, are convenient, cheerful, and welldisposed. The parish church is large, and of fine architecture. Here are four convents, which are of the following orders : San Agustin, La Merced, Santo Domingo, and San Francisco, the last being the finest and largest of all ; also four monasteries for nuns, and a good hospital of San Juan de Dios, with the dedicatory title of Santa Ana. 
This city belonged to the government of Caracas until the year 1678, when it was subjected to that of Merida ; and it is the head city, and the place where the governor resides. It lies six leagues from the sea or entrance of the lake, tor the de- 2  MARACAIBO.  fence of which there have been built three castles or forts. It has a very good, secure, and convenient port, and fit for building vessels, on account of the abundance of timber in its neighbourhood ; and indeed, there are always vessels building in itsdock. Its principal commerce consists in cacao, woods, and leather of the hides of animals of infinite variety, which breed in the surrounding country. Amongst its population are enumerated several illustrious families, and some who are descended from the first conquerors, the Germans of Augusta. The French pirate Lolonois sacked this city in 1668, Francis Drake in 1669, and the French in 1678. In its church is venerated a miraculous crucfix, against which the Quiriquis Indians discharged six arrows, when they rose against the Spaniards, in the year 1600, and sacked and burnt the city of Gibraltar. Now it has been a constant tradition amongst the Indians, that previous to that time the image had its head erect, as though for inspiration, (there appearing to be no mark of the wound on the side to represent the suffering), and that upon being hit by one of the arrows in the eyebrow, it drooped its head, and has ever since remained in that posture. 
[At an average of four years, from 1799 to 1803, the quantity of cacao exported from Maracaibo and Venezuela amounted to H5,000fanegas. The population of its province is, according to Depons, 100,000 souls. This city is in 1q+ in ° iQI « *"<*  lat. 10° 42' n. and  long. 71° 17' w.

1 . Government. — Maracaibo, settled by the orders of the governors of Venezuela, for a long lime was under their command. Afterwards a new division of the governors was made ; and the government was vested in Merida with Maracaibo as a dependency. At length Maracaibo became the capital, and then was given the district the title of province. 
This government extends very little from e. to w. but it runs more than 100 leagues towards the s. where it is bordered by Santa Fe. It is bounded on the w. by the government of Rio de la dacha, a dependency of Granada ; to the n. by the sea, and according to the new circumscription, by Venezuela to the e. 
The territory for a certain distance round the capital is sterile. All the e. shore of the lake is dry, unwholesome, and covered with raquettes and cierges, (plants peculiar to the place), where a tides of commerce cannot thrive, nor even man  subsist. On the w. shore the land does not become fertile for more than §5 leagues to the s. of the city. The whole ofthelandtothe s. of the lake Magrival is, for fertility, the best soil in S. America ; labour and a sufficient population are all that are wanted to render this province flourishing, and to furnish for exportation as much goods as would load 2000 vessels of SOO tons. 
2. City. — This city is situated on the left bank of the lake Maracaibo, and at six leagues from the sea. The foundation is sandy and without any stratum of vegetative earth. The climate is warm, on account of the breezes being weaker and uncertain, the land not being watered by any running stream, and the rain so seldom falling. The heat is excessive, chiefly from the month of March to October, but during July and August it is insupportable; the air appears to issue from a furnace. The only means of preventing the effects of this scorching atmosphere is bathing in the lake. It is in this water that the inhabitants effectually moderate the heat, and correct the acrimony of the blood, inflamed by the rays of the sun. 
But although the heat is here so great and constant, yet Maracaibo is wholesome. There are seldom any endemical diseases, and a person accustomed to the climate preserves a better state of health than is common in places where it is not so hot, and the means of avoiding the heat more numerous. 
The tradewinds commonly blow here from March to June and July: August and September are seasons for calms, unless they are interrupted by the s. winds, which are called in the country virason, on account of their insalubrity. It is observed that when the winds are moderate, there is a great deal of rain, and when they are high they are followed by great droughts : violent storms are frequent ; the thunder is dreadful, and the bolts frequently fall, destroying houses, ships, and every thing that either attracts them, or is in their way. However terrific and destructive these storms may be, the inhabitants are reduced to the necessity of desiring them ; for if they do not happen, earthquakes, yet more dreadful, are likely to be experienced in their stead. Some of these storms are attended with heavy showers, which with an amazing rapidity flow through the town, sweeping away trees, and injuring the houses which may stand in the way. Happily these catastrophes are never of very long continuance. 
The principal part of the city is on the banks of a little gulf, of a league deep, and formed by the lake to the w. The other part is to the n. on the famous neck of the lake which extends three]  
— _ ,__    A R A C A I B 0.  ["leagues, and tlien takes a s. direction.  
The point at which the town begins is called Point Maracaibo ; that at the commencement of the gulf is named Point of Arieta, and is situated nearly opposite tlie point St. Lucia. 
There are a great number of houses at Maracaibo built with chalk and sand, and with a great deal of taste; but in spite of the efforts of government, the cheapness of tiles, and the frequency of conflagrations, which often consume entire streets, the people are of opinion that tile roofs render the dwellings so many furnaces, destructive of the inhabitants, and persevere in the custom of covering their best houses with a sort of reed which grows on the banks of the lake, and which the Spaniards call enea. This mixture of tile and thatch gives the town a mean appearance, and puts it in constant danger from fire. The greater part of the houses are indeed entirely built of this thatch and reed, peculiar to the country. 
As there are neither fountains, wells, nor rivers, no other water is drunk but that of the lake, the taste of which is not agreeable, although the quality is not bad, except in the strong winds of March and April, which causing an influx of the sea, render the water of the lake so brackish as to be scarcely potable. The poor avoid this inconvenience by making excavations in the rocks, but the water procured by this means is of a bad taste, and very unwholesome. The rich have cisterns in their houses to catch the rain water, and the middling classes keep jars for the same purpose. 
3. Population. — According to a census made in 1801, the number of inhabitants was .22,000; but the Spaniards, who about this time fled here from the Spanish part of St. Domingo, from whence they were driven by the black chief Toussaint, increased the population of Maracaibo to 24,000, divided into four classes ; the nobles, the wealthy commoners, the slaves, and the enfranchised people. 
The noble families are those who have descended from the first conquerors of the country, or from some governors or war officers who have married iri the country, or from any other government officer: for an employment under the crown is considered in America an authentic title of nobility. There are more than thirty of these families ; and but few of them enjoy a moderate competency : in almost the whole of them misery is so severely felt that the idea, of a noble origin is perhaps the truest satisfaction they ever experience. When once a Spaniard falls into poverty, it is for his life. The shame of industry and the love of idleness 

VOL. IT.  makes him heroically brave all the horrors of want. 
The plebeian whites are Europeans or Creoles. This is the class that lives most comfortably, for it is the only one that works. The slaves are very few, on account of the small importation of blacks ; they do not exceed in number 5000. 
The enfranchised people are also very few ; they follow every trade. 
The custom the people of Maracaibo contract from their infancy, of sailing on the lake, gives them an early propensity to navigation. They repair by water in numerous bands to Porto Caballo, La Guaira, and other ports to which trade or amusement may invite them. When war suspends mercantile voyages, these people serve on board corsairs ; but whatever side they take, they always sustain the appellation of being as good soldiers as they are sailors. The proximity of the lake renders them also good swimmers and excellent divers. 
Those who resist the attractions of a nautical life either establish pens, or watch those of their fathers. Nothing proves more their fitness for this sort of occupation than the immense number of cattle that cover the savannas of Maracaibo : the principal ones are those of Jobo, Ancun, Palmores, and Cannades. It should be remarked that there is more merit in keeping cattle in this neighbourhood than in any other of the provinces ; for the country being without rivers or marshes, in the dry seasons a number always perish, in spite of the precautions taken in such cases, to drive them towards the places where they can be watered. 
But what does yet more honour to this people, is their singular lively tempers, their application to,and progress in literature, in spite of the bad state of public education. Whilst the Jesuits had the charge of instructing the youth, their scholars spoke Latin with uncommon elegance and facility ; they understood perfectly rhetoric and the rules of poetry, wrote their own language with remarkable correctness ; and in short, were adept in every thing that constitutes and makes the scholar and the gentleman. The expulsion of these learned instructors deprived the youth of every branch of knowledge. 
It must be allowed that the inhabitants of Maracaibo have activity, courage, and genius ; but there is scarcely any thing else to be said in their favour. Theyarereproachedwithawantofsincerity and veracity, and they never think themselves bound by their signatures until they have tried in vain to set them aside in their courts of law. Their reputation for this is so established, that the strangers} 3 M     MAR  
[repairing hither upon business, affirm that it is better to form connections, in affairs of, importance, with the ladies than with the men ; for they have exclusively that solidity and honour, which every where else are the special perquisites of the male se-;. 
The women here are, in their youth, patterns of chastity and delicacy, and when married, they make faithful wives and excellent mothers : affection for their husbands, household cares, and the education of their children, are the objects of their solicitude, and their only occupation. Music is almost their sole amusement as well before as after marriage ; and the favourite instrument is the harp. Every evening and on feast days, the harmonious sounds of this instrument are to be heard from every house.

Maracaibo, a great lake of this same province and kingdom, which took its title from a cacique of this name, who was living at the time of the entrance of the Spaniards. It is about 132 miles long fromw. to s. and 90 wide at the broadest part, though Coleti "reduces it to 33. It is formed by many rivers, viz. by the Pamplona or Zulia, the Chama, which flows down from the sierras of Merida, and consisting of the melted snows ; by the San Pedro, the Motatan, the largest of any, and which rises in the mountain desert of Serrada. On the w. it is tered by the Paurate, which flows dov/n from the sierras of Ocafia, the Catumbo by three mouths, the Arinas, the Rico de Oro, the Torondoy of salutary waters, the Sucui which descends from the cordillera lying behind the river Del Hacha, and the Astillero, celebrated for its rich woods, with many others of less consideration. This freshwater gulf is navigated by many frigates, bilandcrs, and other vessels ; and even the largest might plough through the bottom, if the bar at the entrance would permit. In it are two small islands called, the one De las Palomas, the other De la Vigia. In the high seatides the waters of the gulf of Venezuela enter this lake, and then its waters are somewhat brackish. Its first discoverer was Bartholomew Sailler, a German, lieutenant of the General Ambrosio de Alfinger, who entered it in 1529, and who, from having found a number of houses built in the same manner as they are at Venice, gave it the name of Venezuela, a title which was afterwards extended to the whole of the province. At the present day there are not more than four very small settlements, and the beams of timber on which the houses are built are converted.,  as far as relates to the parts in the water, into stone. At a small distance from the lake dwell the barbarous nations of the Quiriquires, Zaparas, Pocabuyes, Alcoholades, and Bohures or Bobures Indians. It abounds in excellent fish, and especially in manaties or marine cows, of an extraordinary size. Near the e. shore is an island called De las Borricas, very fertile and delightful, in which are large breeds of cattle. It is four leagues w. of the city of Coro.

The climate is warm, and the whole territory is very plain and unpeopled. In this place, which takes its name from a cacique, the Indians killed Alonso de Ojeda and six other Spaniards, who fell into an ambush prepared for them by the said cacique.

==[[Marajo|MARAJO]]==, a large island of the river of Las Amazonas or Maranon, also called De Joanes, and Del Sol. On the n. it is washed by the waters of the sea, mixed with those of this river, and on its other sides by the river itself, being divided from the continent by a very narrow strait, called Tagipura. To the n. n. w. it has two isles, called Caviana and Machiana, and to the e. it looks •upon the city of Gran Para, on the shore of the Maranon or Amazon. This island is 28 leagues in circumference, and not 10, as according to Mr. Martiniere, who situates it 12 miles from Para instead of 24. It is about 92 miles wide from «. to s. and about 142 at  its greatest length. It took its name From a nation of barbarian Indians, called Marayos, which word has since been by the Spaniards corrupted into Marajo. Some relate the fable that these Indians have their feet reversed, that is to say, with the heels before. The island is much cultivated, and produces maize, plantains, sugarcanes, and other vegetable productions peculiar to the country in great abundance. The climate is rather hot, but the sea winds are very refreshing.

On its s. shore are some rich silver mines, which gave origin to the celebrated plan of the Mississippi, from the mouth of which river it is 1100 miles distant. Mr. de Lochon, who was sent hither by the French India company, in 1719, was the author of the riches of the Mississippi. He did, in fact, find mines of silver, but in such small quantities that they were not worth the trouble of digging ; they, however, soon proved to contain no other metal than lead ; and, in consequence, Mr. de Lochon, much chagrined and deceived, returned to France. The company attributed the failure of their enterprise to the ignorance of Lochon, sent a Spaniard, a man who had been taken in Pensacola, and who had worked in a mine of New Spain. He, however, succeeded as little as the former ; and the same ill success waited upon the exertions of a company of miners, who were sent at the expence of Mr. Renaudiere. These, however, did in time turn even the lead mine to some account. 
==[[Maranan|MARANAN|Maranham]]==, a province and captainship of the kingdom of Brazil, which comprehends the island of its name, or of San Luis, and the immediate continent ; bounded e. by the province of Seara, n* by the Brazilian sea, w. by the captainship of Para, and s, by the country inhabited by the barbarian Indians, especially the nation of the TapuyesT There are in this province three considerable rivers, besides some others of inferior note ; the three are the Itapienni, Miarim, and Monyi, which empty themselves in the gulf 3m2    m*  M A K  of* M.arana n or San Luis. The larger islands ore Sipotuba, Santa Ana, and Ygarapatoe, besides that of Maranan or Maranham, in which is the capital. To the e. and w, of this island are many sand banks formed by the river, which empties itself into the sea in front of it. It is well peopled, and the land lies high, with beautiful hills and mounts, from which flow down streams of limpid waters, which fertilize the UariUrasi The climate is pleasant and healthy, produces all kinds of grain and fruits, and the crops of maize are gathered twice in the year. The city of San Luis was founded by the French in 1612, and ceded to the Portuguese in the following year, 1613. It is small, but populous, cheerful, rich, and well fortified. It was taken by the Dutch in 1641 ; but in 1643, recovered by the Portuguese, to whom, at the present day, it belongs. It has a good castle, upon a small eminence, and two other forts, called San Francisco and Santiago ; also a large suburb, called San Andres. This city is the head of a bishopric, suffragan to the archbishop of San Salvador of the bay of Todos Santos, erected by the Pontiff Innocent XI . in 1677. The port is of difficult ingress, but is large and secure, and has a good bottom. Lat. 2° 30' s. [See the Captainship Para.] [Maranan, a large island at the mouth of the noted rivers Miarim, Itapienni, and Monyi, on the n. side of the province of Maranhao or Maranham in Brazil. The island is oblong, about 31 miles long, very fertile, and well inhabited. The French, who seized on it in 1612, built a town here, called St. Louis de Maranham, but it is now in the hands of the Portuguese, and is a bishop's see. It is very strong, and has a stout castle built on a rock, towards the sea, which commands a very convenient harbour. The island itself is very difficult of access, by reason of the rapidity of the three rivers which form it ; so that vessels must wait for proper winds and seasons to visit it. Besides the town mentioned here, are two smaller ones, viz. St. Andero, on the most n. point, and Santiago on the s. The natives have about 27 hamlets, each consisting of four large huts, forming a square in the middle ; all being built of large timber, and covered from top to bottom with leaves, so that each may contain 200 or 300 persons. The inhabitants are strong and healthy, and live to a great age ; bows and arrows are their only weapons, with which they are very dexterous ; but they are fierce and cruel, especially to their enemies. The continent, three or four leagues from the island, is inhabited by the Tapoutapares and Tupinambes nations, who are  wild and fierce, and divided into 15 or 20 such hamlets as have been described above. Contigu* ous to these are the territories of Cuma and Gayeta, inhabited by nearly the same sort of people.

==[[Maranon|MARANON]]==, Amazonas, Orellana, or Solimoes, a river of all the above names, and the largest not only that is known in America, but in the whole world. It is said to rise from the lake Lauricocha, in the province of Tarma, of the kingdom of Peru, in lat. 10° 29' s. ; but its most remote source is the river Beni, which rises in the cordillera De Acama, about 35 miles from La Paz, in the province of Sicasica. It runs from n. to s. as far as the province of Yaguarsongo inthe kingdom of Quito. From thence it forms the strait of Guaracayo, follows its course from w. to e. running a distance, from its rising to where it enters the •sea, of 1800 leagues. The mouth or entrance of this river is about 180 miles wide ; the tidewater ends at Obidos, which is about 400 miles from its mouth. The river at this place is 905 fathoms wide, and the violence with which this river flows is so powerful that it repels the waters of the ocean, and retains its own stream pure and unimpregnated for a distance of 80 leagues within the sea; [a circumstance the more wonderful, in as much as from the above distance of Obidos to its mouth, 400 miles, it has a fall of only four feet.} Innumerable are the rivers which it receives in its longextended course, but the larger and more considerable are, to then, the Santiago, Morona, Pastaza, Tigre, Napo, Negro, Putumayo, Yupura, Yaguapiri, Curupatuba, and Yari ; and to the s. the Guallaga, Ucayale, Cuchivara, Yahuari, Yutay or Yotau, Cayari or Coyari, Madera, Topayos, Tocantines, Xingu, Guanapu, . Muju, and others.  #    M ARANO N.  The first who discovered the mouth of this immense river was Vicente Yailez Pinzon, in 1498. It was afterwards reconnoitred, in 1541, by Francisco de OreWana, lieutenant of Gonzalo Pizarro ; in 1560, by Pedro de Ursua, by order of Don Andres Hurtado de Mendoza, Marquis of Cailete, viceroy of Peru ; in 1602, by the Father Rafael Ferrer, of the abolished order of Jesuits of the province of Quito, and missionary amongst the Cofanes Indians; and in 1616, by order of Don Francisco de Borja, prince of Esquilache, viceroy of Peru ; also, in 1725, by Juan de Palacios, in company with the Fathers Domingo Breda and Andres de Toledo, by the command of San Francisco. Besides these, Pedro Texeira, a Portuguese, undertook, in the name of Santiago Raimundo de Noroiia, governor of San Luis de Maranan, the farther navigation of this river, arriving by the Napo as far as the port of Payamino, in the province of Moxos. In 1639, Don Geronimo Fernandez de Cabrera, Count of Chinchon, and viceroy of Peru, sent as far as Para the Fathers Christoval de Acuna and Andres de Artieda, Jesuits of the province of Quito, and also the Father Samuel Fritz, a German, and of the same extinguished company, a great missionary and profound mathematician. He it was that took the most exact observations as far as Para, in his voyage made in the years 1689 and 1691, and who gave to the world the first geographical chart of theMaraiion, made and publisedin Quito in 1707. Subsequently to this, another map was published by Don Carlos de la Condamine, of the royal academy of sciences at Paris ; he being one of the persons commissioned to make astronomical observations under theequinoctial line. This lastmap is the most correct, and was made in the voyages he took in the Maranon, in the year 1743 and 1744, although it was much amended and enlarged by another map which had been formed by the Father Juan Magnin, of the aforesaid company, and then missionary of the city of Borja, of the province of Mainas, and an honorary academician of the sciences at Paris., 
The shores and innumerable islands of this large river were peopled and inhabited by many barbarous nations of Indians, which have, for the most part, at the present day, either become extinct, or retired to the wilds of the mountains. The name of Amazonas is derived to this river from some warlike women who attacked and opposed the Spaniards ou their first arrival, and more especially the discoverer Orellana. Some hold this as fabulous, but others maintain that Ihere not only were, but are at this time, such wo-  men as those of whom we speak ; and these people recount of them the same stories that are told of the Asiatic Amazons in the Termodonte. 
The fact, however, is, that the women here called Amazonas were nothing more than women who assisted their husbands in battle ; a practice very prevalent amongst the greater part of the nations of the barbarian Indians. Such was the case when Gonzalo had to encounter women in the kingdom of Tunja, Sebastian de Benalcazar in Popayan, Pedro de Valdivia in Chile^ as also other conquerors in different provinces. The Amazonas of the Maranon, of which we treat, and who made front against Orellana, were of the nation of the Omaguas, dwelling in the islands and on the shores of the river. The historians who paint the government and customs of this fictitious race, are nothing but idle dreamers and fabulists, publishing wonders to accredit their voyages and histories. 
From the mouth of the river, as far up as the Yavari, on the s. shore, and as far as the settlement of Loreto de Los Ticunas on the «. including the river itself, and the adjacent territories, the Portuguese possessions are considered at the present day to extend ; and from thence upwards is claimed by the crown of Spain. The latter power has founded many settlements of Indians, who have become Christians ; as also certain reducciones, which form the mission called De Mainas, the same having had its origin, and having since flourished, under the discipline and management of the regulars of the company of Jesuits of the province of Quito, until that this order was supplanted, in 1767, by the president Don Joseph Dibuja, who sent various priests in the place of the former ; these banishing the Jesuits from the dominions of the king. Other missionaries were also sent of the religious orders of San Francisco,. to the shores of the rivers Manua, Putumayo, and Caqueta. 
The woods of the Maranon are immense ; full of tigers, dantas, bears, leopards, wild boars, and an infinite variety of venomous snakes and serpents ; the most formidable of which are those called gacumamas, saramicues, corahs, exis, cascabeles, canelas, tigrillas, buhos, and intiyut/us. 
The waters swarm with alligators or crocodiles ? fine fish of various kinds, the same being peculiar to the lakes in its vicinities, some sorts exceedingly rare, and especially those called charapas or tortoise, the manati or seacow, the same being called also pexebuey or oxfish, from its great resemblance to this animal, and which feeds upon grass and suckles its young.

■m  MARANON.  
The multitude, variety, and beauty of the birds, are truly striking to foreigners ; and amongst the most noted are the piuries, quacamayos, loros, chiriclascs, paujies, preticadores, trompeteros, mountain fowl, partridges, pheasants, quails, and the rest. 
Here are an infinite variety of apes of different figures, and of the most extravagant and ridiculous appearances. The vegetable productions which grow wild, are cacao, cinnamon, bainilla, zarzaparilla, and pines ; and those which are in part wild and generally cultivated are coffee, su- .garcanes, rice, maize, plantains, pitajai/as, lemons, limes, oranges, &c. also wax, storax, capayve, carana, oil of Maria, copal, and other balsams, resins, and medicinal drugs. The woods are extremely precious, of every kind, colour, and size; such as cedar, redwood, (palorojo), holy wood, (palosanto), pine, basla, andchonta, whicli resembles ebony. The herbs and roots, although they are in very great abundance, are but little known, as are the different coloured mineral earths. 
Throughout the whole country washed by this mighty river, from the point or strait of Manseriche to its mouth, there is to be found no kind of stone, gold, or other metal. Its current has great violence and rapidity, and its depth is unfathomable. The swellings and freshes are usually very great; and when these happen, the country is inundated for many leagues, the whole of the islands are covered with water, and are made to change their situation, or new ones are formed by the fresh channels which the river in its boundless impetuosity is accustomed to procure itself. 
In the parts called Pongo de Manseriche and Pauxis, its stream is confined in a narrow channel of about three leagues across. The water here is pure and well tasted, but very turbid and thick, owing to the number of trees and pieces of earth which it draws down with it in its course ; .and these impediments render its navigation here somewhat dangerous to canoes, although not so to the larger vessels, or piraguas, of the Portuguese. 
This river is navigable from the city of Jaen, in the kingdom of Quito, as far as its entrance into the sea, which is nearly its whole course. The climate of the countries that it irrigates, from the province of Yaguarsongo to its mouth, is hbt, moist, and unhealthy, especially on its shores, which have also the disagreeable molestation of musquitoes of a thousand kinds, as well as of many other venomous insects. The history of this river was written and published in a folio volume by the  
Manuel Rodriguez, of the extinguished  
Fathe company of Jesuits 
_ [The communication between the Spanish colonies on the borders of the river has -aver been attended with considerable difficulty and danger, ■ on account of some pirates who infested the S. and' N. seas, and intercepted their navigation. The galleons, richly laden with the treasures of Peru, &c. were captured in great numbers by these daring freebooters. Things were in this situation when an account of the successful attempts which had been made to explore the course of the Amazonas reached the court of Madrid, and gave rise to the project of transporting thither, by means of the numerous navigable rivers which flow into it, the riches of New Granada, Popayan, Quito, Peru, and Chile itself. After proceeding down the river, galleons were to be stationed in the harbour of Para, in order to receive the treasures ; and these being joined by the Brazil fleet, it was supposed they might navigate in security in latitudes little known and frequented by these formidable pirates. The revolution, however, which placed the Duke of Braganza on the throne of Portugal, put an end to these important projects. Each of the two nations was then only intent on securing to itself a settlement on that part of the river which best suited its own situation. 
Thus while the Spanish missionaries were endeavouring to form a settlement in the country lyin"- between the banks of the Amazonas and of the Napo, as far as the confluence of these rivers, some Jesuit fathers were occupied in performing the same service for the Portuguese government. These indefatigable enthusiasts, patient of toil, of fatigue, and of hardships of every kind, at length succeeded in establishing St. Paul and numerous other villages, about six or seven days journey below St. Ignacio de Pevas, the last of the Spanish settlements in the vicinity of the Amazonas. Had a free intercourse been permitted between these infant states, the greatest advantages would most certainly have accrued to each. In this way the Spanish settlements might have been supplied with many articles from their Portuguese neighbours, which they could not receive from Quito, as they are effectually separated from it by the cordilleras. Brazil is besides poor, from being unable to dispose of the overplus of those very commodities which cannot be obtained at Peru. If, therefore, the national antipathies and jealousies subsiding between the courts of Lisbon and Madrid had not led them to prohibit all communication between their settlements in the New World, these two provinces, by an interchange of commodities, by  
*  means of the Napo and the Amazonas, might have attained to a degree of opulence and prosperity ■which they cannot otherwise enjoy, and which might ultimately have even proved beneficial to the mother countries.]

It is of a cold temperature, very fertile, and one of the most populous, being full of estates and sugarmills, especially in two spacious valleys of upwards of 12 leagues in length. It abounds in mines of copper, and this metal is worked by the natives to tolerable profit. In the part called Parua is a fountain, with this peculiarity, namely, that wood put into its water sinks to the bottom, and that upon its surface grows a thick petrified crust, which continues enlarging and growing thicker. These bezarstones have a great diaphoretic virtue, and are much esteemed throughout the whole kingdom, according to the relation of Don Joseph Villaseiior, in his " Teatro Americano." In the fields of this jurisdiction grows the herb dictamo real, and the stags who feed upon it have bezarstones found in their intestines, the same being the case in some parts of Peru. The district, the capital of which is of the same name, consists of the following settlements : S. Miguel el Alio, Yrimbo, Tupataro, Cenguyo,

On the e. and n. it is bounded by the real of the mines of Tlapujagua, but being six leagues distant from the same. Its climate inclines rather to cold than temperate, and it is much subject to high winds, which make the country very cold and disagreeable. It is inhabited by 195 families of Indians, 75 of Spaniards, and 90 of Mustees and Mulattoes. It is in lat. 19° 25' n. and long. 100° 3'.

It is formed by Marblehead neck on the s. and e. and is protected by a seawall, which before its late repairs was in imminent danger of giving ■way, to the great detriment, if not ruin of the port. A battery and citadel were erected here in 1795, for the defence of the place, by order of congress. The bank fishery employs the principal attention of the inhabitants, and more is done of this business, i« this place, than in any other in the state. The exports of the year 1794 amounted to 184,532 dollars. Marblehead was incorporated in 1649, and lies in lat. 42° 27' n.

[==[[Margarettsville|MARGARETTSVILLE]]==, a village in Washington county, Maryland, about 10 miles s. by e of Elizabeth town, and six n. e. of William's port 1 
==[[Margarita|MARGARITA]]==, an island of the N.sea; one of the Less Antilles, opposite the coast of Nueva Andalucia, and divided from the same by an arm of the sea eight leagues wide. This island was discovered by Christopher Columbus in his third voyage, in 1498. Marcelo de Villalobos, to whom and to whose heirs it was granted by the Emperor Charles V. in 1524, peopled it in the following year, founding a city, and shortly afterwards a fort lor its defence. The town was, however, attacked and destroyed by the Dutch in 1662, and since that time the splendour and riches which were acquired to it from its pearl fisheries have much diminished. A pearl was found here which was carried to the king, and which was valued at 100,000 dollars.  Tbis island is 38 miles long from e. to w, 18 wide. It is very fertile, and abounds in good pastures for breeding cattle; but it has no fresh water, and tli is article has always been supplied from the continent. This evil, together with the aforesaid plunder of the pirates, induced many of its inhatants io pass over andestablish themselves on the mainland. [According to Uepons, its present population may be estimated at 14,000 souls.] The commerce carried on in cacao, tallow, and hides, and now and then, some pearls, is altogether trifling. ' [Instead of a vegetative earth, the upper stratum, of nearly a foot deep in this island, is composed of sand, mixed with a rotten cellular marine plant. A little cotton, and a quantity of sugar hardly sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants, composes the whole produce of the island. The place however by its local position can excite the envy of every commercial and maritime nation ; for, being separated from the mainland of Tierra Firme by a channel of only eight leagues wide, and lying in the direction of the prevailing winds, it might become, under a government which would allow a free trade, the magazine of Cumana, Barcelona, Caracas, La Guaira, and of all the cities in the interior. The island of La Trinidad, which is much less favourably situated for the purpose, affords the Spanish contraband trade all the necessary support and: accommodation, and by this channel is sold an incredible quantity of merchandise. There would be no other place of export but Guayana, if the e . part of Tierra Firme found at this island, free of navigation and near at hand, those things which it is now obliged to buy at places more distant. There are other no less important advantages attached to this island. The channel which separates it from Tierra Firme has, in the middle, the island of Coche, which makes a passage between it and Margerita of but two leagues broad, through which the navigator must indispensably pass. Every ship coming from Europe to Cumana, Barcelona, and even to La Guaira, is obliged to sail along the s. side of La Margarita. If the island were therefore in possession of the enemies of Spain, the commerce with Europe, and the communication with the neighbouring islands, would be the more easily intercepted, as the vessels that would endeavour to avoid the channel would be taken by the cruizers, which would find arsenals in Magarita. An enterprising enemy Mould find also in the situation of Margarita, the means of easily directing his military expeditions against whatever part of Tierra Firme he might wish to invade.  

MAR  Spain is therefore induced to keep possession of the island, not because she can draw any positive advantage from it, but from the mischief it might do her, were it to pass under the power of another government ; and for this reason every possible means are taken, in time of war, to protect it. 
On the whole coast of the island there are but three ports. The principal one is that of Pampatar, to the e.s. e. ; the second, called Pueblo de la Mar, lies a league to leeward of this ; and the third is on the n. side, and is called for that reason Pueblo del Norte, i. e. North village. In each of these ports there is a village, the most important of which is that of Pampatar, where all the fortifications thought necessary for defence have been built. 
The capital is the town of Asuncion ; situated nearly in the centre of the island. There are three villages which bear the names of the valleys where they "are built, viz. the Valley of St. John, Margarita, and De los Robles, or of the Oaks. The population is 14,000, of which there are 5500 whites, 2000 Indians, and 6500 slaves and free people. There is scarcely any part of the island cultivated, the industry of the people being directed towards the fisheriesat the island of Coche, in the middle of the channel. The fishermen are the Indians of Margarita, who are obliged to transport themselves to Coche, and fish there during three months of the year, for the pitiful salary of one real a day, and the miserable and oidy food of bread made of maize. In 1803, the fisheries were conducted by five individuals of Margarita: they yield a great quantity of tortoises and fish, which is salted and sold for the consumption of the continent and the neighbouring islands. 
They manufacture at Margarita cotton hammocks, of a better fabric than those made at other places. They make also cotton stockings of an extremely fine quality ; but they are too dear to be used save but by the rich. The island abounds in paroquets and other curious birds. The poor raise poultry, and sell their turkeycocks and fowls to the foreign islands. The check against smuggling being less active here than in other places, individuals procure mules from Tierra Firme, under the mask of their being for their own use, and clandestinely export them for the foreign co'onies. 
In 1804, there was no other mercantile firm in this island than that of the eldest brother of D. Francisco Maneyro. It is 127 miles to the w. of the island of La Trinidad, and 25 from the city of Cumana in Tierra Firme; in lat. 11° n. and long. 64° 9' a>.]

It is 126 fathoms in perpendicular height. The plain is more than 40 paces long and 80 wide, and is elevated 14 yards above the level of the sea. The Jesuits, the missionaries of the Orinoco, built in 1736, a fortress on this rock, with three batteries to  guard the river  against  the navigation of the  Caribes Indians, and to secure from the attacks of these infidels the settlements of the missions, which extend from thence upwards. This they sue' ceeded in doing, owing principally to the natural advantages and strength of the position; for such is the narrowness of the pass here, owing to the ■whirlpools and numerous other rocks, that vessels may only pass one by one ; and, indeed, even then it is difficult for them so to master the current as to avoid being driven against the foot of this large rock.

Pacific ocean, between the lat. of 8° and 10° 25' s. and between the long, of 138° 47' and 140° 30' w. They were first discovered by Mendana and Quiros in 1595 ; and in 1774, Capt. Cook ascertained their situation more particularly, which before was different in different charts. La Dominica is about 16 leagues in circuit. Hood's island was discovered by Capt. Cook in 1774. The inhabitants of these islands, taken collectively, are, without exception, the finest race of people in these seas ; and for good shapes and regular features, they perhaps surpass all nations. They are thought to be of the same origin as those of Otaheite and of the Society islands. They have hogs, fowls, plantains, and other vegetables and roots ; likewise a few breadfruit and cocoa trees.

It is 80 leagues in length from n. to s. It was discovered by Captain Alonso de Ojeda in 1505, and it was conquered by Rodrigo Bastidos. It is for the most part of a warm and moist temperature, although it is not without cold spots in the neighbourhood of the Snowy sierra. The country is mountainous and rugged, and full of forests, in which are woods of exquisite kinds ; also abundance of animals and birds of different species. Here are considerable breeds of cattle, the fat and hides of which produce to the natives greater profit than the carcase ; also some mules. Here is plenty of cotton, indigo, cacao, tortoiseshell, Brazilwood, sugar, honey, bainilla, and some wheat. Indeed, its vegetable productions alone might make this province the richest of any in America, had it but a proportionate commerce. Neither is it without its mines of gold, silver, and precious Stones, but they are not worked. It has some abundant saline grounds, producing a peculiarly white salt, and is famous for the growth of the herb coca, which is here called hayo, and cultivated by the Indians, with whom it is continually used ; since they assert, that in taking it as food  they become exceedingly invigorated. The Indians; who are reduced to the faith, make vessels of marble with great ingenuity ; also woven cotton stuffs, and different curiosities of straw dyed of various and beautiful colours. Many infidel nations of Indians dwell in the serranias of this province. The first who entered to preach the gospel here was San Luis Beltran, accompanied by Fr. Luis Vero. Amongst other rivers that irrigate this province are the Magdalena, the Santa Marta, and the Cesar, or Pompatao. It is divided into five cor~ regimientos of Indians, few of which contain more than 1000 each, and these are divided into six cities, one town, and 19 settlements.

The capital is the city of the same name founded on the seacoast by Rodrigo Bastidas, in 1525, with a good port, defended by two castles, called San Juan and San Vicente. It is of an hot temperature, very reduced and poor ; the greater part of the houses being covered with straw, with the exception of the cathedral and some other edifices. It is the head of a bishopric, erected in 1529, and suppressed by the Pontiff Paul IV. in 1562, but established again, in 1577, by Gregory XIII. This city was made the military depot by the Spaniards at the conquests of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, and from hence sallied forth Gonzalo Xirninez de Quesada. In 1543, it was sacked by the pirate Robert Baal ; in 1555, by the French privateer of Peter Braques ; and in 1596, by Francis Drake, who reduced it to ashes. It was    

MARTA.  again attacked in 1629 by Adrian Juanes Pater, who carried away the artillery from the castle of Sail Juan, a thing which had been formerly attempted, though ineffectually, by Christoval Cordello; again in 1655, by William Gauson, who, with a strong squadron, and after disembarking 2000 men, succeeded in destroying it entirely. The last time that it was besieged was in 1672, namely by two privateers, one English and the 'the other French, when it was completely pillaged, and even the bishop was carried away, he being at that time Don Lucas Fernandez de Piedrahita. He was, however, generously delivered up by the leader of these outlaws, together with all that had been taken from him, and sent in a vessel to Panama, just time enough to be promoted to the cathedral of this place. The fort is clean, convenient, and so capacious as to be capable of receiving large fleets. It is of a great depth, and lies as it were in a cavity of a most lofty sierra, and having, in front, a great mountain, which serves as a kind of defence to the city by the Snowy sierra, from whence it is three leagues distance. It enjoys a temperature which is healthy and less hot than that of Cartagena ; and it is refreshed by an abundance of sweet water flowing from the river Gaira, which passes very near the city, and lends a pleasing prospect from the number^of beautiful trees that grow upon its banks. It has a convent of the monks of St. Francisco, and another of S. Domingo; the latter having had the honour of having been inhabited by S. Luis Beltran. On the shore of the aforesaid river grows a tree called " pah de manteca" from the gloss upon its leaves, and from the circumstance of these being used for washing, in as much as they lather like soap. The same plant is held extremely good for the expulsion of worms, and the draught is made of a decoction of its bark in water. It is in lat. 11° 15' 30" n. Long. 74° 8' w.

Marta, Santa, some very lofty mountains, called also Sierra Nevada, inasmuch as they are constantly covered with snow, in the former province and government. They are a branch of the cordillera of the Andes, and, giving a pass to the Rio Grande de la Magdalena, follow a course as far as the N. sea.

Hidden in their bowels, lie many very ric'i mines of gold, silver,   MAR  
A R  emeralds, and various other precious stones and metals, in the power of no one, save those Indian savages. These mountains may be seen at sea at more than 100 leagues distance, and the last point which tuns towards the sea is in lat. 10° 43' n.

Cattle and sheep are raised here in great numbers ; and rye, corn, and oats, are the chief produce of the island. White pipeclay, and yellow and red ochre, are found in Martha's Vineyard. The ravages of war were severely felt in this industrious spot. In September, 1778, the British made a requisition of their militia arms, 300 oxen, and 2000 sheep, which were delivered up.

MARTIN'S, S. an island of the N. sea, one of the Smaller Antilles ; situate n. w. of S. Bartholomew, and s. w. of S. Augustin : 18 leagues in circumference, without any port or river whatever, but abounding in saline earths. It was discovered by the Spaniards, who remained in possession until they were ousted by the Dutch. These were in their turn dislodged in 1633 by the Marquis of Cadreita, admiral of the galleons, who constructed a fort, and left a strong garrison for its defence. It was thus preserved in the possession of the Spaniards until 1645, when the king ordered it to be abandoned, as being unprofitable and useless, as it was barren of water, and produced nothing. From that time it was peopled by the Dutch and French, who possessed it ; and had many dissensions respecting right of establishment. 
[In this island are good saltpits, and lakes of saltwater, which run a great way within the land; but it has no fresh water but what falls from the  
Cv  
%  MAR  clouds, and is saved by the inhabitants in cisterns. The saltlakes abound in good fish, particularly turtle ; and the saltwater pools are frequented by vast numbers of birds. In the woods are wild hogs, turtledoves, and parrots innumerable. Here are several trees producing gums ; and plenty of the candletree, splinters of which, when dry and lighted, emit a very fragrant smell. Its tobacco, the chief commodity cultivated, is reckoned the best in the Caribe islands. 
At the abandonment of this island by the Spaniards, the French and Dutch afterwards shared it between them ; but in 1689, were attacked and plundered by Sir_ Timothy Thornhill, and in July 1744, were driven out by the British forces, and did not return till after the peace of 1763. They  now enjoy about 35,000 acres, out of the 55,000 which the whole island contains. The two colonies breed poultry and sheep, which they sell to the other islands. They also cultivate a little cotton and coffee. About 30 years ago the French part contained 400 while families, and 10,000 slaves ; the Dutch part no more than 60 families, and about §00 slaves. 
This island, together with the other French colonies, was taken by the English in the present war. In lat. 18° 4' n. and long. 63° 8' w.

==[[Martinico|MARTINICO]]==, an island of the N. sea, one of the Larger Antilles, belonged to the French, who established themselves in it in 1635, transporting colonists from the island of San Christopher, but which now belongs to the English. It is about 36 miles long, and about 17 wide. In some parts it abounds in shelving mountains, from the which flow down in an interrupted course some streams, which render the island extremely fertile and abundant in every thing found in the other American islands. Its principal production, and which forms its chief commerce, is sugar; but it yields also much cotton, indigo, pepper, ginger, cacao, aloes, plantains, maize, olives, and every sort of European herb. The wheat and the grapes have 3p  ffi  MARTINICO.  never answered the expectations that had been formed of them, but the coffee is of the most excellent quality. The air here is hotter than in Guadalupe, but the hurricanes are less frequent and not so violent as in the other islands. It was possessed by the French W. India company till 1651, when it was sold with other islands to the Seiior Parquet ; but in 1664 it was repurchased by the company, and in 1674 ceded to the crown, and incorporated with the other dominions of the same. This island is the best that France possesses. It is divided into five parts, besides another sixth, possessed by the barbarians, the same being more craggy and uneven. 
It is watered by no less than 40 rivers ; some of which are navigable for a great extent through the country ; such are the Pilot, Caput, Salado, and Trinidad: besides these there are many torrents which in the rainy seasons inundate the fields and meadows. Many of the mountains are cultivated, and others are covered with woods, which serve as an asylum for many animals, snakes, and insects ; and the tobacco which grows upon the hills of the mountainous parts is preferred to that growing elsewhere. 
On the coast are various bays and ports very convenient, and capable of receiving large vessels ; and the best of these is between Carbet and fort St. Pierre. The forts of the greatest note are St. Pierre, fort Royal, Trinidad, Marigot, and La Rade. It contains 28 parishes, the same number of settlements, and two cities, which are the following :

In this island dwells the governorgeneral not only of the other French islands, but of this in particular, the dependencies of which are St. Lucia and Granada. It is inhabited by many rich merchants, and is much frequented by vessels, especially those from Nantz, the cargoes of which 'meet a ready sale. The port is a secure place of shelter during hurricanes, and lies to the windward of the other islands ; this being a circum-  stance very favourable for those who are proceeding to Europe. 
This island has suffered much from the insurrections of the native Indians ; also in 1727, by a dreadful earthquake, which lasted 11 hours without ceasing ; and in 1767, in which it was almost utterly destroyed, no less than 16,000 souls perishing ; in 1766, by a strong hurricane ; and in 1772, by another earthquake, which destroyed the fortifications. 
Its first consequence is to be dated from the reign of Louis XIV. who sent to it many protestants, in order to extirpate this sect from France. It is, at the present day, in a very flourishing state, well fortified and capable of putting under arms 10,000 men, besides from 40 to 50,000 Negroes. 
By the returns made in 1767, its inhabitants amounted to 12,450 whites, 1840 Negroes and free Mulatoes, 70,553 slaves, and 443 Cimarrones, or such as had fled from their masters, forming altogether 84,817 souls : likewise it contained 3776 horses, 4214 mules, 293 asses, 12,736 bulls and cows, 975 pigs, and 13,544 sheep. The plantations consisted of 11,444 quadras or square plots, the which were sowed with 6, 638,757 coffee plants, 861,043 of cacao, 1,764,807 of cotton, and 59,966 of cassia. The pastures or sabanas occupied 10,972 quadras; there were 1 1 ,966 covered with woods, and 8448 uncultivated and abandoned. In all the plantations there were 116 watermills, 12 windmills, and 184 horsemills. The product of this island is computed, at the present day, at 23,000,0001bs. of sugar, 3,000,0001bs. of coffee, and 40,0001bs. of cacao ; the third part of which belongs to foreigners, and the rest to the French. In the exportation of the above produce in 1776, 143 vessels were employed. 
The Dutch, commanded by their admiral, Michael Adrian Ruiter, attacked this island in 1674, when he disembarked, but was routed with great loss. The same fate also happened to the English under the command of Admiral William Penn in 1695; [but it was ceded to the English in the present war, together with Guadaloupe and the other French colonies, through the successful enterprises of Lieutenantcolonel Beckwith, in Feb. 1809.

==[[Maryland|MARYLAND]]==, a colony of the English in N. America, and at the present day one of those composing the United States. It was originally part of the province and colony of Virginia, until the time of Charles I. of England, who granted it to George Calvert Lord Baltimore, to hold to himself and his successors ; but he having died before the patent could be sent to him, the right devolved upon his son Cecil Calvert; the same, who being a catholic, had fled from the persecutions which this body were then suffering in England. He spent immense sums in founding the colony in 1632. This colony, at first, consisted of 200 Catholic persons ; but the party of the Protestants prevailing, the founder was deprived of his right, and the Catholics were kept under. Maryland is bounded n. by Pennsylvania, e. by Delaware state and the Atlantic ocean, s. and w. by Virginia. The territory near the coast is low, but it continues rising by degrees, until it terminates in the Apalachian mountains. The greater part of this province was covered with thick woods ; and these were cut away by the first settlers, who opened certain plains or sabunas, which were irrigated by many streams. 
Maryland, as well as Virginia, has no city whatever of consideration; though the number of its navigable rivers is great. But we must not forbear to mention the city of Annapolis, the seat of government ; for although it be but small, it is handsome, situate on the shore of the river Patuxent, and contains 150 houses, besides the house of ao  sembly. The inhabitants are of the same religion as those of Virginia, namely, of the reformed church of England, although the clergy here have much greater liberty. 
The principal fruits that are cultivated are tobacco similar to that of Virginia ; and the planters dwell by their storehouses, where the ships have the convenience of coming up to their very doors to unlade, by means of the rivers and of the bay. The tobacco called Oroonoko is stronger than that of Virginia, on which account it is more in request in Europe, where it is preferred to that coming from the parts bordering on James and York rivers. This tobacco is produced to the quantity of 40,000 loads (car gas) annually. 
The white inhabitants amount to 10,000, and the Negroes exceed 260,000. Here are no woollen manufactories savethoseof the county of Somerset. Mr. de Stivenerith established here not only manufactories for weaving cotton and making silk stockings, but also for all kinds of hardware and firearms, at an immense expence and labour ; and these, although they were at first confined only to one spot, soon became propagated amidst various parts of the province. The common drink is cider, which is very good, and when well made resembles the best white wine. There is no deficiency of this last mentioned article ; but it is all brought from Madeira, as is the rum from Barbadoes. There are also wines of other kinds, beer, and other liquors, brought from England ; for although there are abundance of grapes growing wild in the woods, no wine is made of them. 
The greater part of the Indians live on the e. coast, and some pass the winter in the w. parts, occupying themselves in hunting deer, a mode of life to which they are much addicted by inclination. The number of those who embrace a civilized mode of life, and the principles of Christianity, have been always few; and even these have been diminished by the frequent discords that have arisen amongst themselves. 
The commerce which it carried on previous to the establishment of the United States was very considerable, on account of its many ports and navigable rivers ; and it was computed that an hundred vessels arrived here annually. The want of fortifications have rendered it liable to much injury in the time of war, from the facility with which the enemy mi^ht enter the ports; and this circumstance has produced infinite desolation in its finest parts. The capital is Annapolis. 
[Maryland lies between iat. 37° 56'and 39° 44' n. and between long. 75° 8' and 79°38'o).. It is about 170 miles in length, and 105 in breadth.  

MARYLAND.  [and contains 14,000 square miles, onefourth of which is water. It is divided into 19 counties, 11 of which are on the w. and eight on the e. shore of Chesapeak bay. Those on the w. shore are Hartford, Baltimore, Ann Arundel, Frederick, Alleghany, Washington, Montgomery, Prince George, Calvert, Charles, and St. Mary's, which contain 212,089 inhabitants ; those on the e. shore are Cecil, Kent, Queen Ann, Caroline, Talbot, Somerset, Dorchester, and Worcester, containing 107,639 inhabitants. 
The whole number of inhabitants in the state amounted, by the last census but one, to 319,728, of whom 103,036 were slaves ; and by the census of 1810, to 380,546 souls. Each of the counties sends four representatives to the house of delegates ; besides which the city of Annapolis, the metropolis, and the town of Baltimore, send two each. The chief towns of the state, besides these two, are Georgetown bordering on the city of Washington, on the river Patowmack, Fredericktown, Hagarstown, and Elkton. The city of Washington, or the Federal city, was ceded by the state of Virginia and Maryland to the United States, and by them established as the seat of their government, after the year 1800. 
Chesapeak bay, which, as has been observed, divides this state into e. and w. divisions, is the largest in the United States. From the e. shore in Maryland, among other smaller ones, it receives Pokomoke, Nanticoke, Choptank, Chester, and Elk rivers. From the n. the rapid Susquehannah ; and from the w. Patapsco, Severn, Patuxent, and Patowmack, half of which is in Maryland, and half in Virginia. Except the Susquehannah and Patowmack, these are small rivers. 
The climate of this province, the soil, product and trade are the same, in a great measure, with those of Virginia : both here and there the English live at large at their several plantations, which hinders the increase of towns ; indeed every plantation is a little town of itself, and can subsist itself with provisions nnd necessaries, every considerable planter's warehouse being like a shop, where he supplies not only himself with what he wants, but the inferior planters, servants and labourers, and has commodities to barter for tobacco, or other goods, there being little money in this province, and little occasion for any, as long as tobacco answers all the uses of silver and gold in trade. There are few merchants or shop keepers, who may properly be so called, we mean who are not planters also, but live wholly by their trades; The tobacco of this province, called Oroonoko, is stronger than that of Virginia, and no Englishman, who has not a very coarse relish in his smoke, will  bear it ; yet it is as profitable to the planter, and to the trade of the nation in general, being in demand in the e. and n. parts of Europe, where it is preferred before the sweetscented tobacco of James and York rivers in Virginia. The planters in Maryland finding so good vent for their commodity in foreign markets, have cultivated it so much, that the province is thought to produce as much or more tobacco than that of Virginia. The soil is here at least as fruitful, the country being a large plain, and the hills in it so easy of ascent, and of such a moderate height, that they seem rather an artificial ornament to it, than one of the accidents of nature. The abundance of rivers and brooks is no little help to the fertility of the soil ; and there is no grain, plant, or tree, which grows in Virginia, but thrives as well here. The product, the animals, and every thing, is the same here as there, only the black and yellow bird, called the Baltimore bird, goes by another name in Virginia. It had that given it, because the colours of the field of the Lord Baltimore's coat of arms are Or and Sable. 
If the reader has the curiosity to know more of this country in any of the particulars respecting its soil, products, animals, trade, and inhabitants, let him see the history of Virginia' on the same heads, and there is nothing there which may not also be said of Maryland. 
The air of the two provinces has the same agreement ; and if there is any difference in the health of the one country and the other, Virginia perhaps has the advantage. The province of Maryland, however, thrives in a great degree, though it is the younger colony ; and that is a plain proof of the profit of the coarse tobacco, preferable to the sweet, scented, or rather that which is sold to a foreign market turns to a better account every way, than what is made for a home consumption with more labour and cost, and at last with less gain. 
As to the Indians, their language, manners, and customs are the same with those of Virginia. At the first settling of Maryland there were several nations of them, governed by petty kings; but it is thought there are not more than 500 fighting men of them in all the province, if the account Mr. Hugh Jones transmitted to the Royal Society of it be true ; for Mr. Glover, who some years before sent the same society an account of Virginia, says, the Indians in the Lord Baltimore's territories, at the head of the bay, where the English were later seated, are more numerous, there being 3000 of them still in some towns ; but these being in continual wars with each other, are likely soon to be reduced to a small number ; which justifies Mr. Jones's relation of the number in Maryland, since in Mr. Glover's time there was not above 3000*]  
&  
*  MARYLAND.  
[Indian souls in all Virginia ; out of which one cannot reckon there were many more than 500 fighting men. The same Mr. Jones gives us a large account of several things in this province worth notice. 
The ground is uniformly level and low in most of the counties on the e. shore, and consequently covered in many places with stagnant water, except where it is intersected by numerous creeks. Here also are large tracts of marsh, which, during the day, load the atmosphere with vapour, that falls in dew in the close of the summer and fall seasons, which are sickly. The spring and summer are most healthy. 
The soil of the good land in Maryland is of such a nature and quality as to produce from 12 to 16 bushels of wheat, or from 20 to 30 bushels of Indian corn, per acre. Ten bushels of wheat, and 15 bushels of corn, per acre, may be the annual average crops in the state at large. Tobacco is generally cultivated in sets, by Negroes, in the following manner: The seed is sown in beds of fine mould, and transplanted the beginning of May ; the plants are set at the distance of three or four feet from each other, and are hilled and kept continually free of weeds : when as many leaves have shot out as the soil will nourish to advantage, the top of the plant is broken off, which prevents its growing higher : it is carefully kept clear of worms, and the suckers, which put out between the leaves, are taken off at proper times, till the plant arrives at perfection, which is in August : when the leaves turn of a brownish colour, and begin to be spotted, the plant is cut down and hung up to dry, after having sweat in heaps one night. When it can be handled without crumbling, which is always in moist weather, the leaves are stripped from the stalk, and tied in bundles, and packed for exportation in hogsheads containing 800 or 900 pounds. No suckers nor ground leaves are allowed to be merchantable. An industrious person may manage 6000 plants of tobacco, (which yield 10001b.) and four acres of Indian corn. 
All the lowland is very woody, like one continued forest, no part cleared, but what is cleared by the English ; who, though they are seated pretty close one to another, cannot see their next neighbour's house for trees. Indeed it is expected that it will be otherwise in a few years ; for the tobacco trade destroys abundance of timber, both for making of hogsheads and building tobacco houses, besides clearing of ground yearly for planting. 
Maryland is for the most part of a soil sandy, and free from stone, which makes it very convenient for travelling, and there is no occasion for shoeing their horses, except in frosty weather ; and what  with the goodness of their little horses, and the smoothness of the roads, people, upon occasion, can travel 50 miles in a summer's afternoon 1,dim sometimes 100 miles in a day ; but then their miles are not accounted so long as in England. 
The rich and plentiful gifts of Nature add much to the happiness of the place ; the three elements affording plenty of food for the use of man, as deer, fowl, both water and land ; and for the preservation of health, many excellent herbs and roots, the discovery of whose virtue is chiefly owing to the Indians. 
They have timber of several kinds, good for building, and of them several sorts of oak ; as red, white, black, chesnut, water, Spanish, and line oaks, (which last bears a leaf like a willow), cedar white and red; the latter serves only for posts and groundsels ; the white to rive or split into boards, that being the freest from knots, and goes under the name of cypress, though it is falsely so termed. There is a tree called cypress, which is extraordinarily large in bulk, and bears a leaf like the sensitive plant. It is soft, spongy, will not rive, and is fit for no use. Their black walnut is mightily esteemed by the joiners for its grain and colour. There is a sort of poplar that makes good white plank. It is a large tree, and bears a flower like a tulip. They have plenty of pine and dogwood, which is a fine flowerbearing plant, sassafras, locust, a tree of quick growth, and very durable in building ; hickory, of which there are two sorts, red and white ; the latter serves chiefly for firewood, being the best for that use. There is abundance of chesnuts and chinguapmes, another species of chesnuts ; a sort of elm like a Dutch elm ; and the sugar plants and other trees, shrubs, and fruits, mentioned in the history of Virginia. In Maryland is a kind of elder, whose bark is closely guarded with prickles, like a briar ; the tulipbearing laurel and myrtle of several sorts, one of which bears a berry that is worked up, in the e. shore, to a kind of green wax, very proper to make candles with, if mixed with tallow. The staples are wheat and tobacco ; and in the interior country, on the uplands, considerable quantities of hemp and flax are raised. 
The hummingbird and mockingbird are the most curious birds in this province, and the rattlesnake is the most noted of reptiles. 
The air is now more wholesome than formerly, which proceeds from the opening of the country, the air having by that means a freer motion. The summers now are not extremely hot, as in the first settling ; but the winters are generally severe. The n. e. wind is then very sharp, and even cools the air very much in the heat of the summer, when]    

MARYLAND.  [a sudden n. w. blast too often strikes the labourers with fevers, if they are not careful to provide for it, by putting on their clothes while they are at work. 
It is observable in the Indians, that though they are a people very timorous, and cowardly in fight, yet when taken prisoners, and condemned, they will die like heroes, braving the most exquisite tortures that can be invented, and singing all the time they are upon the rack. 
The inhabitants, except in the populous towns, live on their plantations often several miles distant from each other. To an inhabitant of the middle, and especially of the e. states, which are thickly peopled, they appear to live retired and unsocial lives. The Negroes perform all the manual labour. The inhabitants of the populous towns, and those from the country who have intercourse with them, are in their manners and customs genteel and agreeable. 
The inhabitants are made up of various nations, of many different religious sentiments ; few general observations, therefore, of a characteristical kind, will apply. It may be said, however, with great truth, that they are "in general very federal, and friends to good government. They owe little money as a state, and are willing and able to discharge their debts. Their credit is very good ; and although they have so great a proportion of slaves, yet a number of gentlemen of influence have evinced their humanity and their disposition to abolish so disreputable a traffic, by forming themselves into a society for the abolition of Negro slavery. 
The trade of Maryland is principally carried on from Baltimore, with the other states, with the W. Indies, and with some parts of Europe. To these places they send annually about 30,000 hogsheads of tobacco, besides large quanties of wheat, flour, pigiron, lumber, and corn ; beans, pork, and flaxseed in small quantities : and receive in return clothing for themselves and Negroes, and other dry goods, wines, spirits, sugars, and other W. India commodities. The balance is generally in their favour.

Besides these, there are Protestant Episcopalians, English, Scotch, and Irish Presbyterians, German Calvinists, German Lutherans, Friends, Baptists, Methodists, Mennonists, Nicolites or New Quakers ; who all enjoy liberty of conscience. The seminaries of learning are as follow : Washington academy, in Somerset county, which was instituted by law in 1779. Washington college, instituted at Chestertown, in Kent county, in 1782. By a law enacted in 1787, a permanent fund was granted to this institution of 1250/. a year, currency. St. John's college was instituted in 1784, to Avhich a permanent fund is assigned, of 1750/. a year. This college is to be at Annapolis, where a building is now prepared for it. - Very liberal subscriptions were obtained towards • founding and carrying on these seminaries. The two colleges constitute one university, by the name of 'the University of Maryland,' whereof the governor of the state, for the time being, is chancellor, and the principal of one of them, vicechancellor. The Roman Catholics have also erected a college at Georgetown, on Patowmack river, for the promotion of general literature. In 1785, the Methodists instituted a college at* Abington, in Hartford county, by the name of Cokesbury College. 
The legislature of this state is composed of two distinct branches, a senate and house of delegates, and styled the General Assembly of Maryland. On the second Monday in November, annually, a governor is appointed by the joint ballot of both houses. The governor cannot continue in office longer than three yearssuccessively. 
It has been already shewn, that the government was vested by charter in the proprietary of Lord Baltimore. In the year 1689, it was taken out of his hands by the grand convention of England ; and in 1692, Mr. Copely was appointed governor, by commission from William and Mary. In 1692, the Protestant religion was established by law. In 1716, the government of this province was restored to the proprietary, and continued in his hands till the late revolution, when, though a minor, his property in the lands was confiscated, and the government assumed by thefreemen of the province, who, in 1776, formed the constitution now existing.

Masagua, another, with the dedicatory title of San .Pedro, in the province and alcaldia mayor of San Salvador. It contains 1120 Indians, including those of some other seven small settlements annexed to its curacy. 

MASAI A, a settlement of the province and government of Nicaragua in the kingdom of Guatemala ; situate on the shore of the great lake, at the mouth which leads to the Estero or Salt lake. 
Masaia, a volcano of this province and kingdom, which the Spaniards called Infierno dc  Masaya or de Nicaragua, It lies in the sierra, which is three leagues from two very large lakes, and not distant from the former settlement, on a round eminence. The parts surrounding it are full of caverns, and the ground, resounding under the step, indicates that it is hollow. The access to the volcano is not difficult, and it is possible to pursue the journey to its summit on horseback, the distance being somewhat more than half a league. It is open at the top, and the crater, which is round, is about 1500 paces wide, and more than 200 fathoms deep, according to the Bishop Fr. Bartolome de lasCasas : on one side the ground is sloped off to a spot where there is a well, and has much the appearance of a hat with the crown downwards. 
On the top of the mountain are some teocales or altars, on which the Indians used to invoke and offer sacrifices to their deities ; and if, occasionally, there should be a drought, they would throw some boys headlong down from the top of the mountain, thinking that thereby they should be sure of securing the necessary rain. In this well, which, according to the aforesaid author, is from 25 to 35 paces in diameter, is found the matter of the volcano, which appears to be a melted and burning metal, and which may be seen very easily from the side of the well. This mass of matter is here, as in the chief crater, in continual motion ; there is a noise of water boiling most furiously, and sometimes, all in an instant, a wave will burst out as high as a tower, and dash back again with a great noise, exactly similar to that when a sea breaks upon a rock. The light, at the 6ame time, is such, that in the darkest night a person may see to read at a league's distance; and the same may be distinguished 25 leagues at sea. 
The Spaniards thought that the melted metal was gold, and for the purpose of catching some they invented, in 1538, a machine, which was a sort of iron caldron, attached and suspended over the crater by a large chain; this, however, broke, and the greater part of the caldron was torn away, though to that which remained were found amalgamated certain particles of metal, the virtues and qualities of which no alchymist lias been able to discover, or even to soften, so as to work on the anvil.

==[[Masca|MASCA]]==, a nation of Indians of the kingdom of Peru, one of the first which formed settlements agreeably to the order of the first Emperor Manco Inca. They were established to the n. of the city of Cuzco, and at last became confounded with the other Indians. Indeed, we know nothing more of them than what is related by the Inca Garcilaso. 
[==[[Mascomy|MASCOMY]]==, a considerable pond in New Hampshire, in the s. w. part of Grafton county, lying partly in Lebanon and partly in Enfield townships. This pond is from 30 to 40 fathoms deep. The surrounding land bears evident marks, that the surface of this pond was once 30 or 40 feet higher than its present level. By what cause the alteration was made, and at what time, is unknown ; but appearances indicate a sudden rupture, there being no sign of any margin between its former and present height. About a mile distant from its outlet, there is a declivity of rocks, 40 feet higher than the stream, as it now runs. By the situation of these rocks, it appears that they were once a fall, over which the water flowed ; but it has now made for itself a very deep channel, through solid earth, nearly a mile in length, where it seems confined for futurity.] 
==[[Mascota|MASCOTA]]==, a settlement of the head settlement and akaldia mayor of Ostotipac in Nueva Espana ; five leagues to the s. of the same head settlement. 
==[[Mascoutins|MASCOUTINS]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians of New France or Canada, who dwell to the s. of the bay of Puantos. Some French geographers call this territory Land of Fire, and its inhabitants Nation of Fire. This mistake appears to have arisen from the similarity of the Indian terms Mascoutenec and Mascoutens. In fact, Mascoutenec  a   482  is the proper name, a word signifying a plain open country, with little wood ; but the Ponteovatimis Indians pronouncing' this word Mascoutins, and the French having heard of a very similar sound used by the savages to express fire, concluded that such was the name of the nation of which we are treating. It is bounded by the nation of the Kickapous, and with these it has preserved a continual friendship and alliance. In 1672, the Father Alouez and Dablon, of the abolished order of Jesuits, entered here to preach the gospel. These were followed in their labours by others, and particularly the Father Mermet, who, being persuaded by Mr. Juchcreau, native of Canada, undertook their converson in 1700* All, however, met with little success, such was the indocility and superstition of that nation.

MASPH1S, a nation of barbarian Indians of New France or Canada \ the only ones who assisted the American colonies, now the United States, in the war against Great Britain, by which those colonies became independent. The answer which this nation returned to the American deputies is very singular, " Here (said they) are 16s. the whole of our revenue ; we had, indeed, intended to buy brandy with it, but we will drink water ; we will sally forth to the chase, and we will sell the skins of the beasts that we kill, that we may give you the produce."

It is included in New England, and is a principal of the four parts into which this republic is divided; bounded n. by New Hampshire, e. ands. by the Atlantic ocean and the province of Connecticut, and w. by New York. It is 170 miles in length, and 94 at its greatest width. It had from its first establishment, when it was only a colony of England, the privilege of electing its magistrates, governor, and assembly; as also to form and establish such laws as it might  
MASSACHUSETTS.  
# 483  think necessary for its government, without being subject either to the approbation of the king or parliament ; but. its inhabitants having been accused of certain abuses which they had made of this liberty, they were at last divested of these rights in the latter part of the reign of Charles II. This led to an insurrection ; but they some time afterwards succeeded in obtaining another patent of privileges, which, although very favourable, was nevertheless inferior to that which they before possessesed, since now the court had reserved to itself the authority of nominating the governor and principal officers of the republic, and of the militia ; and even although the council was elected by deputies of the people, yet did the governor reserve to himself the right of disapproving their choice, a system which was sufficient to do away intolo their accustomed prerogative. 
The appeals which concerned 300/. and upwards, were to be referred to the king and his council, a practice both legal and constitutional ; but if they were not disapproved by the end of three years, they were considered valid and authorised. There existed a dispute for many years with the English court respecting the salary of the governor of this province. 
This state abounds in neat cattle, pigs, birds, and fish. The inhabitants employ themselves in making manufactures of flax, wool, and skins. On account of abundance of the timber requisite for shipbuilding, a considerable number of vessels are constructed. Here are mines of iron and copper, and some of the former have been worked. Its manufactures, and especially those of hats, have fallen off considerably, owing to the policy adopted by the English. 
This province provides salted meat and fish to the Antilles islands, receiving in exchange sugar and molasses. Here are stills for making rum, also some sugarmills. It was the most powerful colony the English had. Its inhabitants amounted, previously to the war of their independence, to 400,000, 80,000 of whom were capable of bearing arms ; and all had, the liberty of following their own religion. 
In 1721, this province suffered much from the epidemic disorder, the smallpox, and, the deaths bein"" very numerous, a celebrated physician adopted the plan of inoculation, practising it not only upon his wife and children, but also upon himself; when such was the ignorance and fanaticism of the people, that they declared the practice to be something monstrous, and to have had its origin in the infernal regions; and, accordingly, having ascertained that a certain person had under-  gone the process, a large party convened at midnight near his house, and breaking open one of the windows, threw in a lighted granade full of combustibles. Indeed, the whole people being thus averse to this new mode of practice, the magistrates found it necessary to prohibit it for fear of a general sedition ; they therefore convened the physicians, who, either from fear or other policy, declared inoculation to be prejudical ; and, in consequence of this, a bill was passed to its prohibition, with a degree of universal satisfaction that has never been equalled. - But the folly of this measure has been outdone by the cruelty of another, which offered a specific reward to any one who should put to death an Indian ; and, in 1724, a sum of 2250/. sterling was paid to John Lovewell, from his having, in a company of wretches formed for the purpose of hunting down those unhappy creatures, after the same manner as the chase of wild beasts, put to death 10 whilst they were sleeping round their hut. With this black act cast into their teeth, let the English vaunt of their humanity, and declaim against the pretended cruelties of the Spaniards in America ; for these, even were they true, have never come up to such barbarism as we have just related ; a barbarism which cannot find its equal in any other nation whatsoever. 
[In Massachusetts are to be found all the varieties of soil, from very good to very bad, capable of yielding all the different productions common to the climate, such as Indian corn, rye, wheat, barley, oats, hemp, flax, hops, potatoes, field beans and peas, apples, pears, peaches, plums, cherries, &c. That part of the state which is distinguished by the name of the Old or Plymouth Colony, including the counties of Barnstable, Duke's, Nantucket, Bristol, and Plymouth, in point of soil, is the poorest part of the state, being generally sandy and light, interspersed, however, with many excellent tracts of land. The n. middle, and w. parts of the state have, generally speaking, a strong, good soil, adapted to grazing and grain ; very similar to the soil of New Hampshire and Vermont on one side, and to that of Rhode Island and Connecticut on the other. It has been observed that the effects of the e. winds extend farther inland than formerly, and injure the tender fruits, particularly the peach, and even the more hardy apple. The average produce of the good lands, well cultivated, has been estimated as follows: 40 bushels of corn on an acre, t,0 of barley, 20 of wheat, 30 of rye, 100 of potatoes. The staple commodities of this state are fish, beef, lumber, &c

Nailmaking was not an object of considerable attention, until the general court laid a duty on imported nails of every size. This soon " gave nerves to the arm, and motion to the hammer ; and from 400 to 500 nails indifferently made by one
