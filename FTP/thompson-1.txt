==[[Abacactis|ABACACTIS|Abacaris]]==, a settlement of Indians, of this name, in the province of the Amazonas, and in the part or territory possessed by the Portuguese. It is a reduccion of the religious order of the Carmelites of this nation, situate on the shores of a lake of the same name. It lies between this lake and a river, which is also so called, and which is a large arm of the Madeira, which, passing through this territory, afterwards returns to that from whence it flowed, forming the island of Topinambes. 
[==[[Abaco|ABACO]]==, one of the largest and most northern of the Bahama islands, situate upon the s. e. end of the Little Bahama bank. The Hole in the Rock, or (as it is most commonly called) the Hole in the Wall, is the most southern point of the island, and bears about 18 leagues north from the island of New Providence, about 9 or 10 leagues in a n. w. direction from Egg Island, and about 10 or 12 in a n. e. direction from the Berry islands. About 10 leagues to the n. of the Hole in the Wall, on the e. side of the island, is Little Harbour, the entrance to which is between the main land of Abaco and Ledyard's Key, ABA and within which there is good anchorage. There is also an anchorage to the w. of the Hole in the Wall. 
The island of Abaco is at present uninhabited. In 1788 it contained about 50 settlers and 200 Negroes. The lands granted by the crown, previous to May 1803, amounted to 14,058 acres, for the purpose of cultivation ; but the settlers who occupied it have since removed. It contains great quantities of the various kinds of woods which are common to almost all the Bahama Elands. 
To the northward of Abaco, is a long chain of small islands or keys, (including Elbow Key, Man of War Key, Great Guana Key, the Galapagos, &amp;c. &amp;c.) reaching, in a n. w. direction, almost to the Matanilla reefs on the Florida stream ; from whence the Little Bahama bank extends, in a southerly direction, to the west point of the island of the Grand Bahama.

==[[Abancay|ABANCAY]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru, bounded on the e. by the large city of Cuzco, (its jurisdiction beginning at the parish of Santa Ana of that city), and on the w. by the province of Andahuailas ; n. by that of Calcaylares, forming, in this part, an extended chain of snowcovered mountains ; s. by the provinces of Cotabamba and Aimaraez ; s. w. by Chilques and Masques. It extends 26 leagues from e. to w. and is 14 broad. Its most considerable river is the Apurimac, which is separated from it at the n. w. and bends its course, united with other streams, towards the mountains of the Andes. This river is crossed by a wooden bridge of 80 yards long and 3 broad, which is in the high road from Lima to Cuzco, and other provinces of the sierra. The toll collected here is four rials of silver for every load of goods of the produce of the country, and twelve for those of the produce of Europe. The temperature of this province is mild, and for the most part salubrious, with the exception of a few vallies, where, on account of the excessive heat and humidity, tertian agues are not uncommon. It produces wheat, maize, and other grain in great abundance, and its breed of horned cattle is by no means inconsiderable ; but its principal production is sugar, which they refine so well, that it may challenge the finest European sugars for whiteness : this is carried for sale to Cuzco and other provinces, and is held in great estimation. It also produces hemp, cloth manufactures of the country ; and in its territories mines of silver are not wanting, especially in the mountain which they call Jalcanta, although the natives avail themselves not of the advantages so liberally held out to them. Its jurisdiction comprehends 17 settlements. The repartimento, quota of tribute, amounted to 108,750 dollars, and it rendered yearly 870 for the alcabala. The following are the 17 settlements : The capital, Limatambo, 
Huanicapa, Mollepata,

In the above valley the jurisdiction of this province, and that of Andahuailas, becomes divided. It is also memorable for the victories gained in its vicinity by the king's troops against Gonzalo Pizarro, in the years 1542 and 1548. It has a convent of the religious order of St. Dominic ; this order being the first of those which established themselves in Peru. 20 leagues distant from the city of Cuzco. Lat. 13° 31' 30" s.

Their limits and extent are not known, but they are 20 leagues wide, and were discovered by Capt. Francisco Cesar in 1536 ; he being the first who penetrated into them, after a labour of 10 months, in which time he had to undergo the most extreme privations and excessive perils ; not that these exceeded the hardships which were endured by the licentiate Badillo, who entered upon its conquest with a fine army.

==[[Abipones|ABIPONES]]==, a nation of -barbarous Indians, of the province and government of Tucuman, inhabiting the s. shores of the river Bermejo. Their number once exceeded 100,000 ; but they are certainly at present much reduced. They go naked, except that the women cover themselves with little skins, prettily ornamented, which they call queyapi. They are very good swimmers, of a lofty and robust stature, and well featured : but they paint their faces and the rest of their body, and are very much given to war, which they carry on chiefly against such as come either to hunt or to fish upon their territory. Their victims they have a custom of sticking upon lofty poles, as a landmark, or by way of intimidation to their enemies. From their infancy they cut and scarify their bodies, to make themselves hardy. When their country is inundated, which happens in the five winter months, they retire to live in the islands, or upon the tops of trees : they have some slight notion of agriculture, but they live by fishing, and the produce of the chase, holding in the highest estimation the flesh of tigers, which they divide among their relations, as a sort of precious relic or dainty ; also asserting that it has the properties of infusing strength and valour. They have no knowledge either of God, of law, or of policy ; but they believe in the immortality of the soul, and that there is a land of consummate bliss, where they shall dance and divert themselves after their death. When a man dies, his widow observes a state of celibacy, and fasts a year, which consists in an abstinence from fish : this period being fulfilled, an assembly run out to meet her, and inform her that her husband has given her leave to marry. The women occupy themselves in spinning and sewing hides ; the men are idlers, and the boys run about the whole day in exercising their strength. The men are much addicted to drunkenness, and then the women are accustomed to conceal their husband's weapons, for fear of being killed . They do not rear more than two or three children, killing all above this number. 
AB1SCA, an extensive province of the kingdom of Peru, to the e. of the Cordillera of the Andes, between the rivers Yetau and Amarumago, and to the 5. of Cuzco. It is little known, consisting entirely of woods, rivers, and lakes ; and b 2  A C A  hither many barbarous nations of Indians have retired, selecting for their dwelling places the few plains which belong to the province. The Emperor Yupanqui endeavoured to make it subservient to his controul, but without success : the same disappointment awaited Pedro de Andia in his attempt to subjugate it in the year 1538. 

==[[Abismes|ABISMES]]==, Quartel des, that part or division of the island of Guadaloupe which looks to the n. e. It takes its name from its having some creeks, or inlets, which serve as places of shelter for vessels, in case of invasion either from enemies or from hurricanes. Here they ride quite safe, for the bottom is very good ; and being made fast to the strong palmtrees which abound here, they stand in no need of being anchored, which would be inconvenient, and attended with risk, on account of the thick roots thrown out by the above trees. Further on is a small island called Des Cochons, where an engineer, of the name of Renau, endeavoured, without success, in 1700, to build a fort, for the sake of securing the harbour, which is a good one. 
ABITAN1S, a mountain of the province and eorregimiento of Lipes in Peru. In the Quechuan tongue it signifies the ore of gold, from a celebrated mine which is at present nearly abandoned, from the want of workmen. It is nearly contiguous to theBsettleraent of Colcha.

Here are some hidden rocks, or sandbanks, extremely dangerous ; and although there are various navigable channels, it requires the utmost caution to avoid shipwreck, this having been the lot of an infinite number of vessels. These sandbanks are more than 20 leagues distant from the continent, and extend themselves upwards of five leagues to the e. of the island of Tuego.

It has now so much fallen to decay, that it is no more than a miserable hamlet. In its vicinity are some streams of salt water, from which the Indians procure salt for their use. Lat. 5° 51' 30" «. Long. 75° 17' w. 
ACA, a settlement of the alcaldia mayor of Tlaxclala, in NuevaEspana.   f==[[Acaay|ACAAY]]==, a parish in Paraguay, situate on a small river which runs into the Rio Paraguay. It is about 14 leagues *. e. of Asuncion. Lat. 25° 54' 7" s. Long. 57° 25' w.~]

==[[Acadia|ACADIA]]==, a province and peninsula of N. America, on the e. coast of Canada, between the island or bank of Newfoundland and New England, by which it is bounded on the w. It is more than 100 leagues in length from n. w. to s. e. and nearly 80 in width, from n. e. to 5. w. from the gulph of St. Lawrence to the river Santa Cruz. It was discovered in 1497 by Sebastian Cabot, sent thither from England by Henry VII. The French, under the command of Jacob Cartier, of St. Maloes, established themselves here in 1534, in order to carry on a codfishery on the bank of Newfoundland ; and in 1604, Peter Guest, a gentleman of the household of Henry IV. of France, was sent by that king to establish a colony, which he founded at Port Royal. The English entered it under Gilbert Humphry, in consequence of a grant which had been made to this person by Queen Elizabeth, and gave it the title of Nova Scotia. In 1621 King James 1. made a donation of it to the Earl of Stirling ; and in 1627 the French, commanded by Kirk de la Rochelle, made themselves masters of it, destroying all the establishments of the English, who were obliged to surrender it up, in 1629, by the treaty of St. Germains. The French shortly afterwards lost it ; a Governor Philip having taken possession of it; but they, however, regained it in 1691, through the conduct of Mr. De Villebon. In order to settle the pretensions of the rival courts, commissioners were, by mutual consent, appointed in the peace of Riswick, in 1697, to consider which should be the limits of Nova Scotia and New England ; and in the peace of Utrecht, it was entirely ceded to the English, who afterwards returned to it. This beautiful country contains many rivers and lakes ; the principal of these is the Rosignol, well stocked •with fish : there are also many woods, full of excellent timber, and thronged with very singular birds ; as, for instance, the Colibri, or hummingbird, and various others. The same woods abound in many kinds of fruits and medicinal herbs. It is very fertile in wheat, maize, pulse of all sorts, and also produces cattle of various kinds, animals of the chase, and abundance of fine fish. Its   5 principal commerce is in skins and salt fish. The winter is longer and colder than in Europe. The capital is Port Royal.— [The name of Acadia was first applied to a tract from the 40th to the 46th degree of n. lat. granted to De Mons, Nov. 8, 1603, by Henry IV. of France. For the present state of this country, see Nova Scotia.]

==[[Acaponeta|ACAPONETA]]==, the alcaldia mayor of the kingdom of Galicia, and bishopric of Guadalaxara, in Nueva Esparia. Its jurisdiction is reduced. It enjoys various hot and cold temperatures, and has therefore the crops peculiar to both climates; and the same are sown in its district, and produce abundantly. The capital is the town of the same name, situate between the two rivers St. Pedro and de Cartas ; the latter dividing Nueva Espana from the provinces of Rosario and Cinaloa, as also the bishoprics of Durango and Gaudalaxara, from ■whence it is distant 83 leagues, w. n. w.

==[[Acapulco|ACAPULCO|Los Reyes]]==, the capital city of the government of Nueva Espana, situate on the coast of the S. sea. Its inhabitants amount to nearly 400 families of Chinese, Mulattoes, and Negroes.

The city is small, and the churches and houses are moderately ornamented. The greater part of the city is on the seashore. The air is of an extremely hot and moist temperature ; for, independent of its being in the torrid zone, it is entirely shut oxit from the n. winds, being surrounded by lofty serranias. These circumstances render it very unhealthy, especially in the wet season, on account of the damps and seawinds blowing from the s. e. to the great detriment of the inhabitants and merchants who come to trade here ; this being the principal cause why there are scarcely more than eight Spanish families who reside here. It is equally in want of every sort of provision, owing to the reduced and barren state of the land, and is forced to seek its necessary supplies from the Indian settlements within its jurisdiction. The only commerce which it can be said to have, is afair which   is held on the arrival of the ships from China ; and when these depart, there are no other means for the people of maintaining a trade, and if the above resource should happen to fail for three or four years, the place must inevitably be abandoned. At the distance of a musketshot, and on a promontory running far into the sea, is situate the castle and royal fort of San Diego, mounted with 31 pieces of artillery, the greater part of them 24 pounders, for the defence of the entrance of the port, which is safe, and so spacious, that 500 ships can lay at anchor in it with ease. It is surrounded by lofty rising grounds. Its principal mouth is on the s. side, formed by an island of an oblong figure, and somewhat inclining to the s. w. The same island forms also another mouth, which they call chica, or little. The canals on either side of the island are 25 fathoms deep. The governor of the castle has the rank ofcastellano, with the title of lieutenantgeneral of the coasts of the S. Sea ; and for the defence of these coasts, there are three companies of militia, composed of the the whole of the inhabitants, namely, one company of Chinese, another of Mulattoes, and the third of Negroes, who run to arms whenever they hear the cannon fired three times at short intervals. In the settlements of its neighbourhood they grow cotton, maize, and other seeds, vegetables and fruits. They have cattle of the large and small kind, and some tobacco, all of which productions are sufficient for the use of the castle and the city, which is 80 leagues distant from Mexico. — [The famous cut in the mountain, (abra de San Nicholas), near the bay de la Langosta, for the admission of the sea winds, was recently finished. The population of this miserable town, inhabited almost exclusively by people of colour, amounts to 9000 at the time of the arrival of the Manilla galleon (nao de China). Its habitual population is only 4000. The chief trade of Acapulco continues still to be its commerce Avith Manilla. The Manilla ship arrives once a year at Acapulco, with a cargo of Indian goods, valued at 12 or 1300,000 dollars, and carries back silver in exchange, with a very small quantity of American produce, and some European goods.

It is well peopled, and was converted to the Catholic faith by the father Hernando de Santaren, and others of the abolished society of the Jesuits, in 1602. They are docile, of good dispositions and abilities. In the time of their idolatry, they used to bend the heads of their dead with their bodies and knees together, and in this posture inter them in a cave, or under a rock, giving them provisions for the journey which they fancied them about to make ; also laying by them a bow and arrows for their defence. Should an Indian woman happen to have died in childbed, the infant was put to death ; for they used to say, it was the cause of her death.

Its jurisdiction is very extended, and consists, for the most part, of places of a hot and moist temperature, but so fertile is it that it gives annually four crops of maize; and as there is no demand for this production in the other provinces, it follows, of course, that the Indians here are little given to industry. Indeed the ground never requires the plough, and the whole of their labours during the seedtime consist merely in smoothing the surface of the mountains, and in scratching up the ground with a pointed stick. It is at times infested by locusts, which destroy the plants and crops ; and having never been able to find a remedy against this evil, the inhabitants had recourse to the protection of the virgin of La Conception, which is revered in the head settlement of the district of the Chichimecas ; and it is said that, owing to her mediatory influence, the plague has been thought to diminish.

They go naked, but, for the sake of decency, wear a small apron made of the thread of aloes, the rest of their bodies being painted of different colours. They are accustomed, at the birth of their children, to smear them with a bituminous ointment, which hinders the hair from growing, even upon the eyebrows. The women's brows are also entirely deprived of hair, and the juice of jagua being immediately rubbed into the little holes formed by the depilatory operation, they remain bald for ever after.

It produces abundance of wheat and much wild marjoram, which is carried to Peru, and forms the principal branch of its commerce. In this province is the royal road, lying through the Cordillera in the way to Mendoza, which is very rough and dangerous, on account of the many slopes and steep declivities towards the river ; the path is very narrow, and in various places it is necessary to open a pass by means of a pickaxe ; so that, if at any time the mules should crowd together, they would push each other into the river, which has not unfrequently been the case. The royal treasures are carried by this road from the month of November to April and part of May. A few years since, some small houses of brick and mortar have been built on one or other side of the Cordillera, which they call casuchas (miserable huts) ; in these they ,put, in the winter time, some coal, biscuit, and hung beef, so that the couriers, providing themselves with the keys of the doors at Mendoza, or, on the other side, at the Guardia of Aconcagua, may have something to live upon, in case they should be stopt by a fall of snow on their journey ; and with this precaution, a courier goes every month to Santiago, carrying with him the mails brought by the ships from Europe. In the winter it is customary to walk on foot over the snow, from Paramillo, which is three leagues from the top of the Cordillera, and four from its descent to the place which is called Los Ojos de Agua, through the valley of Putaendo; but towards the n. there is another way, which they call De Los Patos, which is the road generally taken in going to the city of San Juan ; but the Cordillera being more lofty here, it is only passable in the months of February and March.

It is one of the most uneven soils in the kingdom, being full of lofty sierras and snowy mountains.

It is intersected by three rivers, which are of no use whatever to it, beingtoo low in their beds ; but they unite and form the Pachachaca, which enters the province of Abancay, and has more than 40 bridges of wood and cord thrown over it in different parts.

It was otherwise in former times, but these mines are now almost all filled with water. Some mines of quicksilver have been discovered, but the working of them has been forbid. Here is little of the cattle kind, and no cloth manufactures peculiar to the country are made here, with the exception of a sort of thick quilt, which they call Chuces ; and a kind of grain is gathered here, known by the name of Maino. This province was united to the empire of Peru by Capac Yupanqui V. Emperor of the Incas. The language of the natives is the same as that which is most universal throughout the kingdom. The capital formerly consisted of a large and well ordered settlement, which was called Tintay, but which is at present but thinly inhabited, on account of the scarcity of water, and from a plague, in which almost all its inhabitants perished. The number of souls in the whole of the province may amount to 15,000. It contains 50 settlements within its jurisdiction. The yearly tribute received by the corregidor used to amount to 800,100 dollars, and the duties paid upon the akavala, (a centage on goods sold), to 688 dollars.

[Alabama, a considerable river of Georgia, which pursues a s. course to thegulph of Mexico, 100 miles w. of the head of St. Mary's river. Its banks are low, and a trifling rain swells it to more than a mile in width. In a freshet the current is rapid, and those who pass are in danger of being entangled in vines and briars, and drowned ; they are also in real danger from great numbers of hungry alligators. The country for nearly 100 miles on each side of this river, that is to say, from the head of St. Mary's to Flint river, which is 90 miles w. of the Alabaha, is a continued soft, miry waste, affording neither water nor food for men or beasts ; and is so poor indeed, as that the common game of the woods are not found here. The country on the zo. of Alabaha is rather preferable to that on the e.]

This beautiful river has a gentle current, pure waters, and excellent fish. It runs about two miles an hour, is 70 or 80 rods, wide at its head, and from 15 to 18 feet deep in. the driest season. The banks are about 50 feet high, and seldom, if ever, overflowed.

[ALACHUA Savannah is a level green plain, in the country of the Indians of that name in E. Florida, situate about 75 miles ay. x from St. Augustine. It is about 15 miles over, and 50 in circumference ; and scarcely a tree or bush of any kind to be seen on it. It is encircled with high sloping hills, covered with waving forests, and fragrant orange groves, rising from an exuberantly fertile soil. The ancient Alachua town stood on the borders of this savannah ; but the Indians removed to Cuscowilla, two miles distant, on account of the unhealthiness of the former site, occasioned by the stench of the putrid fish and reptiles, in the summer and autumn, driven on shore by the alligators, and the noxious exhalations from the marshes of the savannah. Though the homed cattle and horses bred in these meadows are large, sleek, sprightly, and fat, yet they are subject to mortal diseases ; such as the water rot, or scald, occasioned by the warm water of the savannah ; while those whfoh range in the high forests are clear of this disorder.] 26 ALA

Those who navigate these parts are accustomed to pass round beyond them for fear of venturing amongst them, although there are some good channels among them, and with good soundings . They are for the most part barren, producing nothing beyond a herb called fnoron, and deficient in fresh water ; neither do they produce any animal except the mole, which is found here in prodigious numbers. There are, however, a quantity of birds, of three distinct sorts, each forming a community of itself, and entirely separated from the other two ; and it has been observed, that if one party may have fixed upon any place for building their nests, the others never think of disturbing them, or driving them from it ; but the noise these bird's make is so great, that one cannot pass near them without suffering considerably from their united clamours.

In its descent through the mountains it receives several auxiliary streams; thence it winds, with considerable rapidity, through the hilly country 250 miles, from whence it throws itself into the open flat country, by the name of Qakmulgee* Thence, after meandering for 150 miles, it is joined by the Oconee, which likewise has its source in the mountains. After this junction it assumes the name of Alatamaha, when it becomes a large majestic river ; and flowing with a gentle current through .forests and plains 100 miles, discharges itself into the Atlantic by several mouths. The n. channel glides by the heights of Darien, about 10 miles above the bar, and after several turnings, enters the ocean between Sapelo and Wolf islands. The 5. channel, which is esteemed the largest and deepest,  m  after its separation from the n. descends gently,taking its course between M'Intosh and Broughton islands, and at last by the w. coast of St. Simon's sound, between the s. end of the island of that name, and the n. end of Jekyl island.

[==[[Albans|ALBANS]]==, St. a township in Franklin county, Vermont, on lake Champlain, opposite N. Hero island, with 256 inhabitants.] 
==[[Albania|ALBANIA|Albany]]==, a county of the province and colony of New York. It contains a certain number of plains fertile ingrain, in which, and in planks of pine, its principal commerce consists. The winter is extremely cold, and the river Hudson is generally frozen for 100 miles, so as to bear immense burthens. The great quantity of snow that falls at this season is useful, not only because it covers the grain, and keeps it from pe rishing by the frost, but because, when it melts, it so increases the waters of the river, as to facilitate thereby the transportation of the productions of the country. 
[ALBANY County lies between Ulster and Saratoga ; its extent 46 miles by 28. By the state census, Jan. 20, 1796, the number of electors in this county were 6087, and the number of towns 11.] 
Albania, or Albany, the capital of the above county, founded by the Dutch in 1608, together with that of Orange, on the shore of the e 2     ALB river Hudson. It is small, but has a great trade from the contiguity of the I roquese Indians. It contains 350 houses, built afterthe Dutch fashion ; and that of the magistracy, which consists of a mayor, six aldermen, and a recorder, is very beautiful. The city is defended by a regular fort with four bastions, the rest of the fortification consisting of palisades. Here the treaties and alliances have been made with the Indians. It was taken by Robert Car in 1664, and added to this province by Colonel Dongan. [It is 160 miles n. of the city of New York, to which it is next in rank, and 340 s. of Quebec. This city and suburbs, by enumeration in 1797, contained 1263-buildings, of which 863 were dwelling houses, and 6021 inhabitants. Many of them are in the Gothic style, with the gable end to the street, which custom the first settlers brought from Holland ; the new houses are built in the modern style. Its inhabitants are collected from various parisof the world, and speak a great variety of languages, but the English predominates ; and the use of evdry other is gradually lessening. Albany is unrivalled for situation, being nearly at the head of sloop navion one of the noblest rivers in the world. It enjoys a salubrious air, and is the natural emporium of the increasing trade of a large extent of country w. and n. — a country of an excellent soil, abounding in every article for the W. India market ; plentifully watered with navigable lakes, creeks, and rivers ; settling with unexampled rapidity ; and capable of affording subsistence to millions of inhabitants. The public buildings are, a low Dutch church, of ancient and very curious construction, one for Episcopalians, two for Presbyterians, one for Germans or High Dutch, and one for Methodists ; an hospital, city hall, and a handsome brick jail. In the year 1609, Henry Hudson, whose name the river bears, ascended it in his boat to Aurania, the spot on which Albany now stands. The improvements in this city have, of late years, been very great in almost all respects. Wharfs have been built on the river, the streets have been paved, a bank instituted, a new and handsome style of building introduced. One mile w. of this city, in its suburbs, near the manorhouse of lieutenantgovernor Van Ilenssalaer, are very ingeniously constructed extensive and useful for the manufacture of Scotch and rappee .siiiiiT, roll and cut tobacco of different kinds, chocolate, mustard, starch, hairpowder, splitpease, and hulled barley. These valuable works are the property of Mr, James Caldwell, who unfortunately lost a complete set of similar works by fire, in July 1794, with the stock, valued at  37,500 dollars. It is a circumstance worthy of remark, and is evincive of the industry and enterprise of the proprietor, that the whole of the present buildings and machinery were begun and completed in the short space of eleven months. These works are decidedly superior to any of the kind in America. All the articles above enumerated, even to the spinning of tobacco, are manufactured by the aid of water machinery. For the invention of this machinery, the proprietor has obtained a patent. These works give employment and subsistence to 40 poor boys, and a number of workmen.] Long. 73° 42' w. Lat. 42° 40' n.

This colony was established in 1670 by the lords and proprietors of it, who equipped, at their own expence, three ships, and a considerable number of persons, with provisions for 18 months, and an abundance of merchandize, tools, and arms fit for the new establishment ; to which they sent resources yearly, in the proportion required, until it appeared to be in a fit  .*  state to maintain itself. Thus the colonists lived for some years, and in time the productions in which their commerce consisted, increased to such a degree as to have caused them to excel all the other English colonies. 
Albemarle, another county or part of Virginia, washed by the river Fluvana on the s. which divides itself into several branches, and adds much to the fertility of the country.

[==[[Albion|ALBION]]==, New, the name given by Sir Francis Drake to California, and part of thew. w. coast of America, when he took possession of it. A large uncertain tract of the n. w. coast is thus called. Its limits, according to Mr. Arrow  smith's chart  ,are between 27° 12' and 41° 15' n. lat. Humboldt asserts, that, agreeably to sure historical data, the denomination of New Albion ought to be limited to that part of the coast which extends from the 43° to the 48°, or from Cape White of Martin de Aguilar, to the entrance of Juan de Fuca. Besides, he adds, from the missions of the Catholic priests to those of the Greek priests, that is to say, from the Spanish village of San Francisco, in New California, to the Russian establishments on Cook river at Prince William's bay, and to the islands of Kodiac and Unalaska, there are more than a thousand leagues of coast inhabited by free men, and stocked with otters and Phocae ! Consequently, the discussions on the extent of the New Albion of Drake, and the pretended rights acquired by certain European nations, from planting small crosses, and leaving inscriptions fastened to trunks of trees, or the burying of bottles, may be considered as futile. The part of the coast on which Capt. Cook landed on the 7th of March i778, and which some desig-  nate as New Albion, is i  lat. 44° 33'  e. long.  235° 10', which he thus describes : " The land is full of mountains, the tops of which are covered with snow, while the vallies between them, and the grounds on the seacoast, high as well as low, are covered with trees, which form a beautiful prospect, as of one vast forest. At first the natives seemed to prefer iron to every other article of    gr  commerce ; at last they preferred brass. They were more tenacious of their property than any of the savage nations that had hitherto been met with ; so that they would not part with wood, water, grass, nor the most trifling article without a compensation, and were sometimes very unreasonable in their demands."

[These Indians are from West Florida, off the Allibami river, and came to Red river about the same time as the Boluxas and Appalaches. Part of them have lived on Red river, about sixteen miles above the Bayau Raoide, till lately, when most of this party, of about SO men, went up Red river, and have settled themselves near the Caddoques, where, we are informed, they have lately raised good crops of corn. The Cad-      ■I    dos are friendly to them, and have no objection to their settling there. They speak the Creek and Chactaw languages, and Mobilian; most of them French, and some of them English.

[Alleghany Mountains, between the Atlantic I ocean, the Mississipi river, and the lakes, are a long and broad range of mountains, made up of a great number of ridges, extending n. e. and s. w~. nearly parallel to the sea coast, about 900 miles in length, and from 60 to 150 and 200 miles in breadth. Mr. Evans observes, with respect to that part of these mountains which he travelled over, viz. in the back parts of Pennyslvania, that scarcely one acre in ten is capable of culture. 
This, however, is far from being the case in all parts of this range. Numerous tracts of fine arable and grazing land intervene between the ridges. The different ridges which compose this immense range of mountains, have different names in the different states, viz. the Blue Ridge, the North Mountain, or North Ridge, or Devil's Backbone, Laurel Ridge, Jackson's Mountains, and Kittatimy Mountains; which see under these names. All these ridges, except the Alleghany, are broken through by rivers, which appear to have forced their way through solid rocks. This principal ridge is more immediately called Alleghany, and is descriptively named the Backbone of the United States. From these several ridges proceed innumerable branches or spurs. The general name of the whole range, taken collective-  A L M  ly, seems not yet to have been determined. Mr. Evans calls them the Endless Mountains ; others have called them the Appalachian Mountains, from a tribe of Indians who live on a river •which proceeds from this mountain, called the Appalachicola ; but the most common name is the Alleghany Mountains, so called, probably, from the principal ridge of the range. These mountains are not confusedly scattered, rising here and there into high peaks, overtopping each other ; but run along in uniform ridges, scarcely half a mile high. They spread as you proceed s. and some of them terminate in high perpendicular bluffs : others gradually subside into a level country, giving rise to the rivers which run s. into the Gulph of Mexico.] 
[Alleghany River, in Pennsylvania, rises on the w. side of the Alleghany Mountain, and after running about 200 miles in a s. to. direction, meets the Monongahela at Pittsburgh, and both united form the Ohio. The lands on each side of this river, for J 50 miles above Pittsburg, consist of white oak and chesnut ridges, and in many places of poor pitch pines, interspersed with tracts of good land and low meadows. This river, and the Ohio likewise, from its head waters until it enters the Mississippi, are known and called by the name of .Alleghany river, by the Seneca, and other tribes of the Six Nations, who once inhabited it.]

==[[Alva|ALVA]]==, San Luis de Laicacota de  an  silver mines, celebrated for  a mountain of this name, which  establishment their riches, in signifies enchanted lake ; there being a lake at the top of the mountain formed by the Indians, who made use of it as a place in which to deposit and conceal their riches. This place was discovered in 1657 by the Colonel Don Joseph de Salcedo, who, having received some vague rumours of its importance, and finding that there was little need of hands for the working the mountain of San Joseph, sent his men hither to work. They accordingly opened the ground, and having succeeded in finding some metals of a superior quality, contrived to let off the lake, so as to come to the principal vein. Here they discovered an im-   mense quantity of silver, which they dug out at a trifling expence. They also found the mouths of other mmes ; namely, of those of Las Animas and Laicacota Baxa, which were contiguous, and equally rich. From the last of these, Salcedo took, m one night, 93 casks full of silver, valued at a hundred thousand dollars, also a massy lump ot silver, which weighed seven arrobas. The metal was, moreover, so fine and pure, that, after paying the quinto or duty to the king, it was coined into money without any previous refinement. From these riches the disgraces of Salcedo took their origin ; it was from them that arose the bickerings and party spirits which appeared among the Andaluces and Criollos on one side, and the mountaineers and the Viscainos on the other. A battle was the consequence, and the plain was covered with dead bodies. The plain bears the same name (Alva), and is, to this day, strewed with whitened bones. This disastrous affair induced the viceroy, the Count of Lemos, to come in person to put a stop to these differences; and he, upon his arrival, ordered the settlement, which consisted of upwards of 300 houses, to be laid waste ; and finding a pretext for the removal of the Colonel Salcedo, caused him to undergo his sentence in the city of Lima, in 1686 ; but, as the sentence was about to be put into execution, it happened, and, as it is believed, by the decree of heaven, which would bear testimony to his innocence, that the mine became inundated ; so that it could never after be emptied ; and although vast sums have been employed upon this work, no silver has ever since been extracted. ;; ==[[Alvarado|ALVARADO]]==, a very abundant river of Nueva Espana, forming itself from one which descends from the sierras of Zongolica and Misteca.

The monuments of this misfortune are still visible, and various chinks A M B    four or five feet wide, and  running from n.  or chasms are still remaining, especially one, about appearance, Sail Rock.

==[[America|AMERICA]]==, the Indies, or the New World, one of the four parts of the Universe, and the largest. It was richer and better peopled in the time of the Indians, and more fertile and abounding in the necessaries and comforts of life. It is, as it were, surrounded by the sea, and is indeed a continent as far as the Arctic Pole, where its boundaries have not been discovered. This immense country, nearly 2000 leagues in length, was unknown to the ancients, until it was discovered by Christopher Columbus, a Genoese, in tho service of their Catholic Majesties, Don Fernando V. and Dona Isabel, in four following voyages. In the first voyage he departed from the port of Palos de Moguer, with three small vessels and ninety men, in the year 1491, and had to contend with   incredible difficulties, as well in combating the prejudices of the Spaniards, who opposed his ideas, holding his attempt as something chimerical, as in preserving the crews of the vessels that accompanied the expedition ; many of whom, depressed and tired with the labours and hardships of so long a voyage, endeavoured to put an end to their existence. It is improperly called America, from the celebrated pilot Horentin Americo Vespucio, who discovered the continent to the s. of the equinoctial line : others will have that it was before discovered by Sancho de Huelva, who was driven there in a storm in the year 1484. The English assert, that in 1170, or 1190, it was discovered by a man of the name of Madoc, or Madocro, son or brother of Ousen Quisneth, prince of Wales, who, in two voyages to Virginia, Florida, Canada and Mexico, founded English, colonies ; but this is a mere fable. This country has produced, and yet produces gold, silver, and other precious metals, in prodigious quantities, an infinite variety of herbs, plants, fruits, roots, fish, birds, and animals unknown, and such as had never heretofore been seen ; an astonishing variety of exquisite woods, some of the trees being of an enormous size. Its natives, though, on account of the innumerable nations and provinces of which it is composed, differ entirely amongst each other, were nevertheless all idolaters. The greater part of this immense country, which is, from its size, as it were unpeopled, is possessed by the Spaniards, who were its discoverers and conquerors ; but after this, the French, invited by its riches, established themselves in different parts, as also did the English, the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the Danes. America is divided into North and South by the isthmus of Panama, or Tierra Firme. The N. part, known at the present day, extends from 11 to 70 degrees of latitude, and comprehends the kingdoms of Nueva Espana, California, Louisiana, Nuevo Mexico, Virginia, Canada, Newfoundland, Florida, and the islands of St. Domingo, Cuba, Jamaica, Puertorico, and the other Antilles. The Meridional or S. part extends itself from 12 degrees n. lat. to 60 s. comprehending Tierra Firme, Darien, the new kingdom of Granada, Nueva Andalucia, Peru, Chile, Paraguay, Quito, the country of the Amazonas, Brazil, and the Tierras Magallanicas, or of the Patagones. Its largest mountains are those of the great chain, or Cordillera of the Andes, which run from n. to s. from the isthmus of Panama to Cape Horn. The mountain Chimborazo is the loftiest of any known in the world at the present day ; and others, especially those in Quito, are of an extraordinary height, and always covered 2    m

America is also watered by the largest rivers in the universe ; such are those of the Amazonas, Orinoco, Magdalena, Atrato,' La Plata, Esraeraldas, Jeneyro, Negro, Coca, Ucayale, Cauca, Putumayo, Beni, Madera, Napo, Parana, Pilconiayo, Mississippi, St. Lawrence, &amp;c. The barbarous nations belonging to it are innumerable, and scattered over all parts, living in the most savage state in the mountains, forests, and lakes, without any head, government, or laws ; some of them are cannibals, and they all gain their livelihood, in general, by fishing and the chase. Their languages are as various as their different nations ; nevertheless the most universal dialect that is spoken in Peru is the Quechuan and the Aymaran, and in Nueva Espana the Mexican. Of religions, the most common are, idolatry among the barbarians, and the Catholic religion in those countries which have been subdued. Some of the idolaters worship the sun, moon, and the stars; but they confess, and are sensible of a superior Being, who created them, and who preserves them. They believe in the immortality of the soul, the rewards and punishments of another world, and in the common enemy, whom they call Zupay ; in the universal deluge, and many other truths, although even these are enveloped in a thousand errors, and disigured with accounts and fables which have been handed down to them by their ancestors ; others, more savage, adore nothing, or at least pay but little respect to their idols, which they choose from among plants, serpents, and quadrupeds. It is evident they have, all of them, some confused sort of light,, impressing them with something that they cannot understand, but which they respect and fear. The greater part of them are given to polygamy, and they are not without their ceremonies in matrimony, and at their funerals ; but they are all, without exception, much addicted to drunkenness, and have different sorts of strong drinks, which they make of herbs, roots, fruits, &amp;c. They are, for the most part, robust, moderate, liberal, faithful, compassionate, patient, and silent; but revengeful, jealous, luxurious, and stupid : of an obscure colour, with hair long and. black, with round faces, being of a sad countenance, beardless, and of a good stature and person. There are some that are of a good colour, with a cheerful and noble countenance ; and grace and pleasantness are not wanting amongst the women. Besides these Indians, America is inhabited by the Europeans, who have established themselves here since the times of its conquest, also by the sons of those, who are known  by the name of Creoles, those of Peru being called Chapetones, and those of Nueva Espana Cachupines. The Negroes, who are brought from the coast of Africa in considerable numbers, and who are sold as slaves to work in the sugarcane estates, and in the mines of gold or silver, and other servile capacities, are the authors of a race called Castas, or peculiar breeds : thus the Mustees are the offspring of the Spaniard and the Indian, and the Mulattoes of the Spaniard or White and of a Negro or other woman ; the names of such offspring being Zambo, Cholo, Puchuela, Salta Atras, Tente en el Ayre, Quarteron, Quinteron, &amp;c. — This country abounds in gold, silver, copper, quicksilver, iron, antimony, sulphur, nitre, lead, loadstone, and marbles of every sort and colour ; in diamonds, rubies, emeralds, amethysts, granites, alabaster, rockcrystal, and all kinds of precious stones and minerals, besides its pearlfisheries, which are carried on in many parts. — Its fields produce every kind of grain, fruit, pulse, herbs, plants, and flowers, native to Europe, besides an infinite variety of others peculiar to this climate ; such as the cacao tree, the cinnamon, pepper, sarsaparilla, vaynilla, scarlet dye, tobacco, balsams of a thousand kinds, Brazil and logwood, bark, sassafras, aloes, and azibar ; fine smelling incense, gums, barks, resins, and medicinal herbs. The number of cattle is incredible, and the breed of European horses and mules deserves particular estimation. Its woods are filled with tigers, leopards, and bears ; its rivers, with lizards, alligators, and thousands of different kinds of fish; in its fields are found numbers of vipers and snakes, differing, to a surprising degree, in their powers, qualities, forms, and colours ; also other insects and venomous animals. The climate is various, and is changed according to the situation of the country, or of the different places. In the valleys and plains, and on the shores of the sea, it is commonly very hot ; upon the slopes or skirts of mountains, and in the country which lies more lofty, the temperatnre is most commonly mild and pleasant. The copious rains that are frequent under the equinoctial line, are not the only cause of the mildness of temperature experienced in those parts, but this is effected in no small degree by the winds and snows of the neighbouring mountains, from which proceeds an excessive degree of cold. The part possessed by the King of Spain^ and which is the larger, is governed by four Viceroys, established in Lima, Buenos Ay res, Mexico, aud Santa Fe ; an account of which governments will be found under their articles, and for a desg2      

AMERICA.  cription of which we have referred to the Chronicles of Antonio de Herrera, as being the most punctual and complete. 
In what regards those who first peopled, and who were the ancient inhabitants of this hemisphere, and from whence they came, we leave this problem to be answered by the numerous celebrated historians and philosophers who have written so much upon this subject ; observing only, that the opinion which, at the present day, most generally obtains, is, that America was peopled in the n. part, from Kamtchatka. 
[America is one of the four quarters of the world, probably the largest of the whole, and is, from its late discovery, frequently denominated the New World, or New Hemisphere. This vast country extends from the 56th degree of s. lat. to the north pole, and from the 55th to the 165th degree of w. long, from Greenwich. It is nearly 10,000 miles in length. Its average breadth may be about 1800 or 2000 miles. It has two summers and a double winter, and enjoys almost all the variety of climates which the earth affords. It is washed by two great oceans. To the e. it has the Atlantic, which divides it from Europe and Africa. To the w. it has the Pacific, or Great S. sea, by which it is separated from Asia. By these it carries on a direct commerce with the other threeparts of the world. America is divided into two great continents, called North and South America, by an isthmus about 500 miles long, and which, at Darien, about lat. 9° n. is only 60 miles over ; other writers say 34 miles. This isthmus, with the n. and s. continents, forms the Gulph of Mexico, in and near which lie a great number of islands, called the West Indies, in contradistinction to the eastern parts of Asia, which are called the East Indies. 
In America Nature seems to have carried on her operations upon a larger scale, and with a bolder hand, and to have distinguished the features of this country by a peculiar magnificence. The mountains of America are much superior in height to those in the other divisions of the globe. Even the plain of Quito, which may be considered as the base of the Andes, is elevated farther above the level of the sea than the top of the Pyrenees in Europe ; and Chimborazo, the most elevated point of the Andes, is 20,280 feet high, which is at least 7102 feet above the Peak of Teneriffe. From the lofty and extensive mountains of America, descend rivers, with which the streams of Europe, of Asia, or of Africa, are not to be compared, either for length of course, or for the vast body of water  which they convey to the ocean. The Danube, the Indus, the Ganges, or the Nile, in the e. hemisphere, are not of equal magnitude, even with the St. Lawrence, the Missouri, or the Mississippi, in N. America ; and fall far short of the Amazon and the La Plata in S. America. 
The lakes of the New World are no less conspicuous for grandeur than its mountains and rivers. There is nothing in other parts of the globe which resembles the prodigious chain of lakes in N. America, viz. Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario : they may be properly termed inland seas of fresh water : and even those of the second or third class are of greater circuit (the Caspian sea excepted) than the greatest lake of the ancient continent. 
The luxuriance of the vegetable creation in the New World is extremely great. In the s. provinces, where the moisture of the climate is aided by the warmth of the sun, the woods are almost impervious, and the surface of the ground is hid from the eye under a thick covering of shrubs, of herbs, and weeds. In the n. provinces, although the forests are not incumbered with the same wild luxuriance of vegetation, the trees of various species are generally more lofty, and often much larger, than are to be seen in any other parts of the world. 
Notwithstanding the many settlements of the Europeans on this continent, great part of America remains still unknown. The n. continent contains the four British provinces, viz. 1. Upper Canada ; 2. Lower Canada, to which are annexed New-Britain, and the island of Cape Breton ; 3. New-Brunswick ; 4. Nova Scotia, to which is annexed St. John's island. Besides these there are the island of Newfoundland, and the 16 United States. It contains also the Spanish territories of E. and W. Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico, California, and Mexico. Besides these there are immense unexplored regions to the w. and n.w. Thes. continent has been already delineated. 
America, so far as is known, is chiefly claimed and divided into colonies by three European nations, the Spaniards, British, and Portuguese. The Spaniards, as they&amp;st discovered it, have the largest ana richest portipn, extending from Louisiana and New Mexico in N. America, to the straits of Magellan in the S. sea, excepting the large province of Brazil, which belongs to Portugal ; for though the French and Dutch have some forts upon Surinam and Guayana, they scarcely deserve to be considered as proprietorsof any part of the s. continent.  
Ml  

AMERICA.  Next to Spain, the most considerable proprietor of America was Great Britain, who derived her claim to N. America from the first discovery of that continent by Sebastian Cabot, in the name of Henry VII. of England, in the year 1497, about six years after the discovery of S. America by Columbus, in the name of the king of Spain. The Country was in general called Newfoundland, a name which is now appropriated solely to an island on its coast. It was a long time before the English made any attempt to settle in this country. Sir Walter Raleigh, an uncommon genius and a brave commander, first shewed the way, by planting a colony in the s. part, which he called Virginia, in honour of queen Elizabeth, who was unmarried. 
The French, indeed, from this period until the conclusion of the war of 1756, laid a claim to, and actually possessed Canada and Louisiana ; but in that war, they were not only driven from Canada and its dependencies, but obliged to relinquish all that part of Louisiana lying on the e. side of the Mississippi ; and the British colonies, at the peace of 1763, extended so far as to render it difficult to ascertain the precise bounds of the empire of Great Britain in N. America. To the n. Britain might have extended her claims quite to the pole. From that extremity, she had a territory extending s. to Cape Florida in the Gulph of Mexico, in n. lat. 25°, and consequently near 4000 miles in a direct line ; and to the w. the boundaries were unknown : but having entered into disputes with her colonies, she brought on a war, of which she felt the ruinous effects, by the dismemberment of her empire in N. America ; and British America, at the peace in 1783, was circumscribed within the narrow limits already mentioned.]

Its forests are very thick. It is 24 leagues long from n. w. to s. e. and 15 wide. The high road from Lima to Cuzco passes through it. It has no other river of note than that which runs down from the province of Vilcas Huaman, dividingthese provinces, and which is called in this province river of Pampas. The same has a bridge of criznejas or twigs, of 30 yards long, and above one and an half wide, by means of which the cargas pass which are carried from Lima to Cuzco, and also those which pass from the latter place to Lima. This province produces wheat, maize,  seeds, and all kinds of fruit ; and from its haying parts in it of a cold temperature, it abounds likewise in the productions which are natural to a similar climate, but this, indeed, in a degree not more than sufficient to supply its own necessities. The only branch of its commerce is sugar, of which 30 or 40 thousand arrobas are manufactured yearly in several estates. Among the best of these is that of Moiobamba, which is entailed on the Marquises of that title. The inhabitants of this province should amount to 12,000 souls, divided into 27 settlements. The repartimiento used to amount to 110,500 dollars, and the alcavala, or centage on goods sold, to 884 dollars. Its capital is the settlement of the same name, in Lat. 13° 25' s. and Long. 73° 4' w.

It comprehends Guayana, or Caribana and Paria. Taking it at its full extent, it is more than 300 leagues from the island of Margarita, to the cape Pinion, or n. shore of the river Marafion, inhabited by the barbarous nations of the Caribes, Omiguas, Peritoes, Palenques, Arvacos, Amapaes, Ivarepices, Parimoes, and others. Among the many rivers which lave it, the largest is the Orinoco. Its climate is for the most part hot and unhealthy. The ground is rugged, mountainous, AND  '57  covered with forests, and but little known. Its coasts, as well on the n. as e. were first discovered by Columbus in 1497, and afterwards by America Vespucio, with Alonzo de Ojeda, in May 1498. It contains mines of gold and other metals, although they are not worked : it has also pearl fisheries, which, although in former times they yielded most plentifully, are at present neglected. It abounds in cattle, and the greatest source of its commerce is in cacao, of an excellent quality. The capital of the province is Cumana.

==[[Andastes|ANDASTES]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians of Canada, bounded by Virginia. 
==[[Andes|ANDES]]==, Cordillera de los, a chain of mountains and most lofty serranias, which extend over nearly the whole of America, for the space of more than 1000 leagues, running continually from n. to s. from the province of Santa Marta, Avhere they have their origin,*in the Sierra Nevada, of the new kingdom of Granada, through the provinces  of Peru a?id Chile, as far as the straits of Magellan and cape Horn, where they terminate. They are divided into two branches : one which passes through the interior of the new kingdom of Granada, on the s. part of the plains of San Juan, beginning in Guayana ; and the other which forms various lines and curves, divided in different directions, through Cuzco, Tueuman, Tarma, and Paraguay, and afterwards becomes united with the grand chain of mountains of Brazil. It takes its course through the isthmus of Panama into the kingdom of Nicaragua, passes into those of Guatemala, Mechoacan, and the province of Cinaloa, and continues itself through the unknown countries of N. America. These mountains are clad with immense forests, and their tops are continually covered with snows, from the melting of which are formed great lakes, and the largest rivers in the world. Their greatest elevation is in the kingdom of Quito, where the lofty Chimborazo rises superbly among the rest ; it has many volcanoes vomiting fire, and which have caused infinite mischief in the provinces, producing earthquakes, inundations, and scattering, far and wide, mud, bitumen, and burning stones : in its entrails are hidden the greatest treasures of nature, such as gold, silver, and other metals, precious stones, marbles, and mineral earths of the rarest and most esteemed qualities. Almost all the mines in the bosom of these rich mountains are worked, and principally those of Peru and Chile. Besides the name of Andes, they bear others also, given to them by the various settlements in their vicinities. The roads which, upon their account, were made by the Incas, Emperors of Peru, were truly magnificent ; but they are at present destroyed, and those which are used now for the communication of the interior provinces, may be called precipices rather than roads, and are only passable on foot, or on mules, which are very tractable and safe. These mountains are inhabited by many barbarous and fierce nations, and they abound in mineral waters of approved medicinal virtues. The greatest width of these mountains is 20 leagues, being in some parts 12 leagues from the seacoast, and in others approaching to it within five leagues. They abound in vicunas, guanacos, monkeys, and apes of infinite kinds, tigers, leopards, and swine, who have the navel in the spine and smell of musk, with a multitude of other curious birds and animals, altogether unknown in Europe ; such is the condor, in the kingdom of Chile, which is a carnivorous bird of an extraordinary size, having the power to carry with it up into the air animals of considerable weiffht, such as sheep, and even small "2  ANDES.  m  calves, making, as it flies, a noise which may be heard at a great distance. The craggy parts abound in cacao, so useful for the Indians, as also in canc.hnlagua. It has been attempted to pass from Chile to Peru, but this cannot be effected during six months in the winter without imminent risk, since many have been lost who have engaged in this enterprise. Indeed it is said, that at that time the Cordillera is shut up. [The lofty chain of the Andes, running along the western coast of America^ extends on both sides of the equator to near the 30th degree of latitude. It is of unequal height, sinking in some parts to 600 feet from the level of the sea, and at certain points, towering above the clouds to an elevation of almost four miles. The colossal Chimborazo lifts its snowy head to an altitude which would equal that of the Peak of Teneriffe, though placed on the top of Mount Etna. The medium height of the chain under the equator may be reckoned at 14,000 feet, while that of the Alps and Pyrenees hardly exceeds 8000. Its breadth is proportionably great, being 60 miles at Quito, and 150 or 200 at Mexico, and some districts of the Peruvian territory. This stupendous ridge is intersected in Peru and Nueva Granada by frequent clefts or ravines, of amazing depth ; but to the n. of the isthmus of Panama, it softens down by degrees, and spreads out into the vast elevated plain of Mexico. In the former provinces, accordingly, the inhabitants are obliged to travel on horseback or on foot, or even to be carried on the backs of Indians ; whereas carriages drive with ease through the whole extent of New Spain, from Mexico to Santa Fe, along a road of more than 15,000 miles. The equatorial regions of America exhibit the same composition of rock that we meet with in other parts of the globe. The only formations which Humboldt could not discover in his travels, were those of chalk, roestone, grey wakke, the topazrock of Werner, and the compound of serpentine with granular limestone, which occurs in Asia Minor. Granite constitutes, in South America, the great basis which supports the other formations ; above it lies gnesls, next comes micaceous schist, and then primitive schist. Granular limestone, chlorite schist, and primitive trap, often form subordinate beds in the gnesis and micaceous schist, which is very abundant, and sometimes alternates with serpentine and sienite. '1 he high ridge of the Andes is every where covered with formations of porphyry, basalt, phonolite, and greenstone; and these, being often divided into columns, that appear from a distance like ruined castles, produce a very striking and pic-  turesque effect. At the bottom of those huge mountains, occur two different kinds of limestone ; the one with a filiceous base, enclosing primitive masses, and sometimes cinnabar and coal ; the other with a calcareous base, and cementing together the secondary rocks. Plains of more than 600,000 square miles are covered with an ancient deposit of limestone, containing fossil, wood and brown iron ore. On this rests the limestone of the Higher Alps, presenting marine petrifactions at a vast elevation. Next appears a lamellar gypsum, impregnated with sulphur and salt ; above this, another calcareous formation, whitish and homogeneous, but sometimes cavernous. . Again occurs calcareous sandstone, then lamellar gypsum mixed with clay ; and the series terminates with calcareous masses, involving flints and hornstone. But what may perplex some geologists, is the singular fact noticed by Humboldt, that the secondary formations in the new world have such enormous thickness and elevation. Beds of coal are found in the neighbourhood of Santa Fe, 8650 feet above the level of the sea ; and even at the height of 14,700, near Huanuco in Peru. The plains of Bogota, although elevated 9000 feet, are covered with sandstone, gypsum, shelllimestone, and even in some parts with rocksalt. Fossil shells, which in the old continent have not been discovered higher than the summits of the Pyrenees, or 11,700 feet above the sea, were observed in Peru, near Micuipampa, at the height of 12,800 ; and again at that of 14,120, besides at Huancavelica, where sandstone also appears. The basalt of Pichincha, near the city of Quito, has an elevation of 15,500 feet; while the top of the Schneekoppe in Silesia, is only 4225 feet above the sea, the highest point in Germany where that species of rock occurs. On the other hand, granite, which in Europe crowns the loftiest mountains, is not found in the American continent above the height of 11,500 feet. It is scarcely known at all in the provinces of Quito and Peru. The frozen summits of Chimborazo, Cayambe, and Anitsana, consist entirely of porphyry, which, on the flanks of the Andes, forms a mass of 10 or 12,000 feet in depth. The sandstone near Cuenca has a thickness of 5000 feet; and the stupendous mass of pure quartz, on the w. of Caxamarca, measures perpendicularly 9600 feet. It is likewise a remarkable fact, that the porphyry of those mountains very frequently contains hornblende, but never quartz, and seldom mica. The Andes of Chile have a distinct nature from those three chains called the Maritime Mountains, which have been successively formed by the  waters of the oeeao.  
This great interior structure     60  appears to be coeval with the creation of the world. It rises abruptly, and forms but a small angle with its base ; its general shape being that of a pyramid, crowned at intervals with conical, and, as it were, crystallized elevations. It is composed of primitive rocks of quartz, of an enormous size, and almost uniform configuration, containing no marine substances, which abound in the secondary mountains. It is in the Cordillera of this part of the Andes, that blocks of crystal are obtained, of a size sufficient for columns of six or seven feet in height. The centra! Andes are rich, beyond conception, in all the metals, lead only excepted. One of the most curious ores in the bowels of those mountains is the pacos, a compound of clay, oxyd of iron, and the muriate of silver, with native silver. The mines of Mexico and Peru, so long the objects of envy and admiration, far from being yet exhausted, promise, under a liberal and improved system, to become more productive than ever. But nature has blended with those hidden treasures the active aliments of destruction. The whole chain of the Andes is subject to the most terrible earthquakes. From Cotopaxi to the S. sea, no fewer than forty volcanoes are constantly burning ; some of them, especially the lower ones, ejecting lava, and others discharging the muriate of ammonia, scorified basalt and porphyry, enormous quantities of water, and especially moya, or clay mixed with sulphur and carbonaceous matter. Eternal snow invests their sides, and forms a barrier to the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Near that confine the torpor of vegetation is marked by dreary wastes. In these wide solitudes, the condor, a fierce and powerful bird of prey, fixes its gloomy abode. Its size, however, has been greatly exaggerated. According to Humboldt, it is not larger' than the lammer geyer, or alpine vulture of Europe ; its extreme length being only three feet and a half, and its breadth across the wings nine feet. The condor pursues the small deer of the Andes, and commits very considerable havoc among sheep and heifers. It tears out the eyes and the tongue, and leaves the wretched animal to languish and expire. Estimating from very probable data, this bird skims whole hours at the height of four miles ; and its power of wing must be prodigious, and its pliancy of organs most astonishing, since in an instant it can dart from the chill region of midair to the sultry shores of the ocean. The condor is sometimes caught alive, by means of a slipcord ; and this chate, termed correr buitres, is, next to a bullfight, the most favourite diversion of the Spanish colonists. The dead carcase of a cow or  horse soon attracts from a distance crowds of these birds, which have a most acute scent. They fall on with incredible voracity, devour the eyes and the tongue of the animal, and plunging through the anus, gorge themselves with the ^entrails. In this drowsy plight they are approached by the Indians, who easily throw a noose over them. The condor, thus entangled, looks shy and sullen ; it is most tenacious of life, and is therefore made to suffer a variety of protracted tortures. The most important feature of the American continent, is the very general and enormous elevation of its soil. In Europe the highest tracts of cultivated land seldom rise more than 2000 feet above the sea ; but in the Peruvian territory extensive plains occur at an altitude of 9000 feet ; and three fifths of the vicevoyalty of Mexico, comprehending the interior provinces, present a surface of half a million of square miles, which runs nearly level, at an elevation from C000 to 8000 feet, equal to that of the celebrated passages of Mount Cenis, of St. Gothard, or of the great St. Bernard. These remarkable facts are deduced chiefly from barome» trical observations. But Humboldt has adopted a very ingenious mode, infinitely superior to any description, of representing at one view the collective results of his topographical and mineralogical survey. He has given profiles, or vertical sections, of the countries which he visited, across the continent, from Acapulco to Mexico, and thence to Vera Cruz ; from Mexico to Guanaxuato, and as far as the volcano of Jorullo ; and from Mexico to Valladolid. These beautiful plates are in every way highly interesting.]

[ANDROS Islands, sometimes called Holy Ghost Islands, are of very considerable magnitude, and have been very erroneously placed in almost every map or chart of the Bahama islands. They extend in a sort of curve, or crescent, upwards of forty leagues in length. There is a passage between the northern point of them (at Joulter's keys) and the Berry islands, ofdifficult navigation, and not above eight feet deep. Vessels, therefore, proceeding from that quarter to Cuba, should go round the n. end of all the Berry islands, over the Great Bahama bank; which, however, will jnot admit yessels drawing more than 12 feet. There are also several passages, or creeks, (though very shallow), through this chain of islands, particularly towards the s. extremity and Grassy Creek keys. Upon the W: side of Andros islands is the most nextremity of the Great Bahama bank. On the e. side there are no soundings at any considerable distance from the shore. The most n. point of the principal Andros island lies about 10 or 11 leagues w. n. w. from the w. end of New Providence. High Point, which is the most s. part of it, lies about eight leagues s. from the w. end of the same island. There are few, if any, inhabitants now on Andros island. In the interior of the island, there is a shallow swamp or lake of fresh water, almost the only one which is to be found in the Bahama islands ; and it communicates with the sea by a creek, or lagoone, navigable for flatbottomed boats. Great quantities of various sorts of timber abound in the interior ; but, from the shallowness of the banks, and extreme difficulty of getting any communication to the coast, the trees remain untouched. One part of Andros island extends to the w. very far into the Great Bahama bank, in a s.w. direction from New Providence, towards Salt key and the island of Cuba. In 1788 Andros island contained about two hundred inhabitants, including slaves; and previous to May 1803, lands were granted by the crown, to the amount of 16,025 acres, for the purpose of cultivation.

It has alsothe college which was formerly of the Jesuits, and contiguous to that, the church of San Miguel, of Indians ; and of San Ildefonso, of barefooted Carmelites, which is a house for novices and for studies ; two colleges of San J uan de Dios, one for novices and the other a hospital, called San Pedro ; the college of San Hipolito de la Caridad, and the convent of Bethlemites, of the La Convalescence, with schools for children ; the church of the Oratorio de San Felipe Neri, and that of the congregation of the ecclesiastics of St. Peter, for the practising of ministers in the duties of the pulpit and the confessional. Its monasteries are those of Concepcion, San Geronimo, Santisima Trinidad, Santa Catalina, of Dominican nuns ; Santa Ines de Monte Policiano, of the same order ; of Santa Rosade Maria, of barefooted Carmelites ; of Santa Monica, of the Recoletan Agustines, Capuchins, and St. Claire. The colleges which adorn this city are, San Pedro and San Juan y in which is included the Tridentine seminary, where the collegians are taught grammar, the graver sciences, and the Mexican tongue ; also the great college of San Pedro and San Pablo, for studying theology and philosophy • of San Geronimo, for teaching grammar ; and of San Ignacio, for the graver studies. Here is a college for children, with the title of La Caridad ; another entirely for married women and widows ; that of Jesus Maria, contiguous to that of San Geronimo ; and another female convent, with a magnificent temple and devout sanctuary of the miraculous image of Nuestra Senora de la Soledad. Besides these aforesaid temples, there are, without the walls of the city, various chapels and hermitages in the wards of the Indians which encompass it; and with those who inhabit these wards, and those within the city, the numbers of families amount to 3200 of Mexican Indians, and 15,000 Spaniards, Mustees, and Mulattoes. The commerce which they maintain, although it has been upon the decline from the beginning of the present century, with regard to what it was before, consists of cloths and fruits of Spain and of the country, and some cloths from China, besides various effects which find their way hither from the other provinces. It also traffics in soap of various qualities, cotton manufactures, fine earthen ware, resembling that of Talavera, and all kinds of iron and steel work, as ploughshares, choppingknives, tableknives, spurs, and stirrups ; and, what are held in particular estimation, the white arms, renowned for a singular temper, and not inferior to those of Toledo. It is the seat of the bishop suffragan to the archbishop of Mexico, established in the year 1526, in the city of Tlaxcala, and translated to this in 1550. Its mitre has had the glory of having adorned the head of the venerable Senor Don Fray Juan de Palafox, whose canonization is no small subject of discussion at the present day. This famed person was the author of many sacred and profound works, and among the rest, those of the turbulent disputes which he maintained with the extinguished society of the Jesuits. 
[La Puebla de los Aageles, the capital of the intendancy of its name, is more populous than Lima, Quito, Santa Fe, and Caracas ; and after Mexico, Guanaxuato, and the Havannah. the most considerable city of the Spanish colonies of the new continent. La Puebla is one o£the small number of American towns founded by European colonists ; for in the plain of Acaxete, or Cuitlaxcoapan, on the spot where the capital of the province now stands, there were only in the beginning of the 16th century a few huts, inhabited by Indians of Cholula. The privilege of the town of Puebla is dated 28th Sept. 1531. The consumption of the inhabitants, in 1802, amounted to 52,951 car gas (of 300 pounds each) of wheaten flour, and 36,000 cargas of maize.

[Angeles, Puebla de los, Intendancy of. This intendancy, which has only a coast of 26 leagues towards the great ocean, extends from 16° 57' to 20° 40' of n. latitude, and is consequently wholly situated in the torrid zone. It is bounded on the n. e. by the intendancy of Vera Cruz, on the e. by the intendancy of Oaxaca, on the s. by the ocean, and on the w. by the intendancy of Mexico. Its greatest length, from the mouth of the small river Tecoyame to near Mexitlan, is 118  
■i  

ANGELES.  [leagues; and its greatest breadth, from Techuacan to Mecameca, is 50 leagues. 
The greater part of" the intendancy of Puebla is traversed by the high cordilleras of Anahuac. Beyond the 18lh degree of latitude the whole country is a plain eminently fertile in wheat, maize, agave, and fruit trees. This plain is from 1800 to 2000 metres, or 5905 to 6561 feet, above the level of the ocean. In this intendancy is also the most elevated mountain of all New Spain, the Popocatepetl. This volcano, first measured by Humboldt, is continually burning ; but for these several centuries it has thrown nothing up from its crater but smoke and ashes. This mountain is 600 metres, or 1968 feet, higher than the most elevated summit of the old continent. From the isthmus of Panama to Bering's straits, which separate Asia from America, we know only of one mountain, Mont St. Elie, higher than the great volcano of Puebla. 
The population of this intendancy is still more unequally distributed than that of the intendancy of Mexico. It is concentrated on the plain which extends from the eastern declivity of the snowy mountains to the environs of Perote, especially on the high and beautiful plains between Cholula, La Puebla, and Tlascala. Almost the whole country, from the central tableland towards San Luis and Ygualapa, near the S. sea coast, is desert, though well adapted for the cultivation of sugar, cotton, and the other precious productions of the tropics. 
The tableland of La Puebla exhibits remarkable vestiges of ancient Mexican civilization. The fortifications of Tlaxcala are of a construction posterior to that of the great pyramid of Cholula, a curious monument, of which Humboldt promises to give a minute description in the historical account of his travels in the interior of the new continent. It is sufficientto state here, that this pyramid, on the top of which he made a great number of astronomical observations, consists of four stages ; that in its present state the perpendicular elevation is only 54: metres, or 177 feet ; and the horizontal breadth of the base, 439 metres, or 1423 feet ; that its sides are very exactly in (he direction of the meridians and parallels ; and that it is constructed (if we may judge from the perforation made a few years ago in the n. side) of alternate strata of brick and clay. These data are sufficient for our recognising in the construction of this edifice the same model observed in the form of the pyramids of Teotihuacan, which that author also describes. They suffice also to prove the great analogy between these brick monuments, erected by the most ancient inhabitants of Anahuac,  the temple of Belus at Babylon, and the pyramids of Menschich-Dashour, near Sakhara in Egypt. 
The platform of the truncated pyramid of Cholula has a surface of 4200 square metres, or 45,208 square feet English. In the midst of it there is a church dedicated to Nuestra Senora de los Remedios, surrounded with cypress, in which mass is celebrated every morning by an ecclesiastic of Indian extraction, whose habitual abode is the summit of this monument. It is from this platform that we enjoy the delicious and majestic view of the Volcan de la Puebla, the Pic d'Orizaba, and the small Cordillera of Matlacueye, which formerly separated the territory of the Cholulans from that of the TIaxcaltec republicans. 
The pyramid, or teocalli of Cholula, is exactly of the same height as the Tonatiuh Itzaqual of Teotiuhacan, already adverted to ; and it is three metres, or 9.8 feet, higher than the Mycerinus, or the third of the great Egyptian pyramids of the group of Ghize. As to the apparent length of its base, it exceeds that of all the edifices of the same description hitherto found by travellers in the old continent, and is almost the double of the great pyramid known by the name of Cheops. Those who wish to form a clear idea of the great mass of this Mexican monument, from a comparison with objects more generally known, may imagine a square, four times the dimensions of the Place Vendome, covered with a heap of bricks of twice the elevation of the Louvre ! The whole of the interior of the pyramid of Cholula is not, perhaps, composed of brick. These bricks, as was suspected by a celebrated antiquary at Rome, M. Zoega, probably formed merely an incrustation of a heap of stones and lime, like many of the pyramids of Sakhara, visited by Pocok, and more recently by M. Grobert. Yet the road from Puebla to Mecameca, carried across a part of the first stage of the teocalli, does not agree with this supposition. We know not the ancient height of this extraordinary monument. In its present state, the length of its base is to its perpendicular height as eight to one, while in the three great pyramids of Ghize, this proportion is as one and sixtenths and one and seventenths to one, or nearly as eight to five. 
The intendancy of Puebla gratifies the curiosity of the traveller also with one of the most ancient monuments of vegetation, the famous ahabuete, (cupressus disticha. — Linn.), or cypress" of the village of Atlixco, which is 76.4 feet English in circumference, measured interiorly (for its trunk is hollow) ; the diameter is 16 feet English. This cypress of Atlixco is, therefore, to within a few k 2

It lies six miles and three quarters s. w. by s. from Skenesborough Fort, 10 e. s. e. from Fort George, and 12 n. e. by n. from Fort Edward on Hudson river. Such was the savage state of this part of the country ; and it was so covered with trees laid lengthwise and across, and so broken with creeks and marshes, that general Burgoyne's army, in July 1777, could scarcely advance above a mile in a day on the road to Fort Edward. They had no fewer than 40 bridges to construct, one of which was of log work two miles in length ; circumstances which in after ages will appear hardly credible. Lat. 43° 22' n. Long. 73° 27' w.]

==[[Annaciois|ANNACIOIS]]==, orANNACous, a barbarous nation of Indians, in the kingdom of Brazil, and province and captainship of Puerto Seguro. They inhabit the woods and mountains to the w. near the rivers Grande and Yucaru. They are constantly in a state of warfare, night and day, and are irreconcilable enemies of the Portuguese, whose colonies and cultivated lands they continually infest, and which they destroyed in 1687. 
==[[Annapolis|ANNAPOLIS]]==, Real, a city and bay of the province and colony of Nova Scotia. It was the capital until this was translated to Halifax, since it was but small and badly fortified. It was founded, with the name of Severn, by the relics of an army established here in the time of Queen Anne of England, on the shore of an excellent bay towards the n. The French established themselves here in the year 1605, under the command of Mr. Pointis, who came from the island of Santa Cruz with a certain number of colonists. He gave it the name of Port Royal ; but the English, headed by colonel Nicholson, drove them from the port. This port, besides being covered with the thickest clouds, is of difficult ingress and egress. Ships can make it only at one certain period of the year, and then but with great precaution ; the currents here being so rapid, as generally to drive them stern foremost ; but indeed, if it were not for this, it would be one of the best ports in the world. It is two leagues in length, and has a small island, called the island of Goats, almost opposite the middle of the quay. It is of a gooddeptb,and well sheltered from every wind. When it belonged totheFrench,theships employed in the whale fisheries used to put in here ; but this commerce is at present wanting, since the English  rather prefer Port Breton. The city, although small, has some beautiful edifices, but of moderate height. The English destroyed the old fortification, and constructed another of a regular form, with four bastions, a deep ditch, a covered way, a counterscarp, a halfmoon, and other exterior works detached from the body of the fortified place, all of which excite in the Indians reverential awe. It has also different batteries conveniently placed to repel the attacks of an enemy, who can only hope to carry it by bombardment. This fortified place appears to be the battery of New England, and is the last to impede the invasion of the French or Indians on the e. as well by sea as land. Not far from the port is a point of land, lying between two rivers, where the tide falls 10 or 12 feet, and all around are beautiful meadows, which arc thronged with all kinds of birds. Its principal commerce consists in skins, which they exchange with the Indians for European manufactures. It is the residence of a governor, and is garrisoned by 500 men. At the beginning of this century it was, amongst the French, the very Dunkirk of America, serving as an asylum for pirates and cruisers, to the ruin of commerce and the fisheries. [The harbour is two leagues in length and one in breadth, and the small island, before referred to, is almost in the middle of the basin, which is said to be large enough to contain several hundred ships. Its depth of water is no where less than four or five fathoms ; it being six or seven on one side of the island, and on the other 16 or 18. The town is not large, but has some very handsome buildings. It is fortified ; nor can it be easily attacked but by a bombardment. The fort is capable of containing about 100 men in its present state.] Long. 65° 22'. Lat. 44° 49' n. Annapolis, Real, a capital city of the county of Ann Arundel, in the province and colony of Maryland, at the mouth of the Severn, and was, by an act of the Assembly in 1694, declared a maritime city, it being ordained that it should be the residence of a collector and commandant of the marine ; from which time it began to take the name of Annapolis. Hither also was transferred the tribunal of the county, together with all the state papers, acts, and other important documents : the parish church was erected in 1699, and a public school was founded agreeably to an act of the Assembly, having the archbishop for its chancellor. Procurators, visitors, and governors were also appointed to preside in this city„ though this establishment failed to answer the wise purposes of its creation. The aforesaid tribunal meets, in &lt;%    ordinary, on the second Tuesday in September, November, January, March, and May. This city consists of more than 40 houses, but has not arrived at that pitch of grandeur that was expected, on account of its planters and merchants having been always at variance, as are those of Virginia; and from this it is judged, that it can never hope to rise at a greater elevation of dignity or fortune. [It stands at the mouth of the Severn, SO miles 5. of Baltimore, 32 e. by n. from the Federal city, 72 5. w. from Wilmington in Delaware state, and 132 s. w. from Philadelphia. In 1694 it was made a port town. It is situated on a peninsula formed by the river and two small creeks, and affords a beautiful prospect of Chesapeak bay, and the e. shore beyond it. This city is of little note in the commercial world, but is, the wealthiest town of its size in the United States. The houses, about 300 in number, are spacious and elegant, indicative of great wealth . The state house is the noblest building of the kind in the Union. It stands in the centre of the city, from which point the streets diverge in every direction like radii. Lat. 39° 2' n. Long. 76° 40' w.]

It is of a very hot temperature ; the earth abounds in gold mines and in salt, from w hich it took the name of the Vozanser, which, in the idiom of the Indians of this country, signifies salt. Its productions are rare, and it is very subject to tempests, when balls of fire and lightning often cause serious mischief. It was at first called Santa Ana de los Caballeros, on account of the number of the knights who assembled at its foundation. In its vicinity dwelt the Tapuyas, Guaticas, Quiijchias, Supias, and other Indians, who are now no longer heard of here. Fifty leagues n. e. of Popayan.

==[[Antequera|ANTEQUERA]]==, [now called Oaxaca,] a capital city of the province and alcaldia mayor of Oaxaca in Nueva Espana, founded in a beautiful and spacious valley of this name, in 1528, by Juan Nunez del Mercado. It is a large and fine settlement, of an extensive vicinity and great commerce, as well from the fertility of its soil, and from the abundance of its fruits, as from its being in the direct road to the provinces of Guatemala. It has, besides the curacy of the Sagrario of its cathedral, the assisting parish chapels of La Sartgre de Christo, Nuestra Sefiora de las Nieves, Nuestra Sefiora de la Consolacion, San Joseph, the hospital of San Cosme and San Damian, and an hermitage of La Santisima Trinidad ; eight convents of monks, which are, two of Santo Domingo, one called Elgrande, a sumptuous fabric, and the other San Pablo ; one of Dezcalzos of San Francisco, that of San Augustm of Nuestra Sefiora de la Merced, of Carmelitas Dezcalzos ; a college which belonged to the abolished society of the regular order of the Jesuits, with a house for students ; two hospitals, one of San Juan de Dios, and another of Bethlemites ; two colleges, denominated Santa Cruz and San Bartolome, for the education of children; thirteen monasteries of nuns, amongst which, are that of Santa Monica de Augustinas, the church, which is of magnificent structure, and the gate of most exquisite architecture, dedicated to Nuestra Sefiora de la Soledad (to whose image, it being very beautiful and miraculous, that city pays singular devotion); another of La Concepcion, another of Santa Cajtalina de Sena, another of Capuchinas ; and a college for the education of children. The city is one of those most conspicuous for the beautiful symmetry of its streets, for its public places and edifices, which would have been still finer, had they not suffered by earthquakes. The temperavol. i.    73  ,is nevertheless  ture, although somewhat hot, healthy. Its eastern part is situated upon the longcontinued top of a hill. It abounds in exquisite fruits, such as pears of various kinds, apples, sapatas, pomegranates, melons, pines, dates, limes, cedars, lemons, pitahayas, nuts, and some grapes. Its wheat is scanty, and of bad quality. The principal productions in which it pays its duties to the King, are cacao of Soconusco, readymade chocolate, and powders of Oaxaca, justly esteemed and celebrated for giving a delicate flavour to chocolate. It also fabricates black sealingwax and some rosaries, the beads of which are made of the kernel of a fruit called tepexilote, on which they write with wonderful skill some versicles of the magnificat, and paint upon them images with a nicety that makes them much esteemed. In the cathedral, which is beautiful and amply large, (having three naves), as well as in the chapels, is reverenced an arm of San Juan Chrisostomo, with other precious relics ;, and in one of its chapels, a cross about a yard in length, made from a part of that wonderful cross ofGuatuIco, brought thither by the bishop Don Juan de Cerbantes. The inhabitants of this illustrious city, which has San Marcial for its patron, are composed of 6000 families ; and in the year 1766, through the benign influence of the patron, the number of souls amounted to 20,000.

[ANTHONY'S Falls, St. in the river Mississippi, lie about 10 miles n. w. of the mouth of St. Pierre river, which joins the Mississippi from the w. and are situated in about lat. 44° 50* n. and were so named by father Louis Hennipin, who travelled into those parts about the year 1680, and was the first European ever seen by the natives there. The whole river, 250 yards wide, falls perpendicularly above SO feet, and forms a most pleasing cataract. The rapids below, in the space of 500 yards, render the descent considerably greater ; so that when viewed at a distance, they appear to be much higher than they really are. In the middle of the tails is a small island, about 40 feet broad, and somewhat longer, on which grow a few hemlock and spruce trees ; and about halfway between this island and the eastern shore, is a rock, lying at the very edge of the fall, in an oblique position, five or six feet broad, and 30 or 40 long. These fulls are peculiarly situated, h  ANT  as they are approachable without the least obstruction from any intervening hill or precipice ; which cannot be said, perhaps, of any other considerable fall in the world. The scene around is exceedingly beautiful. It is not an uninterupted plain, where the eye finds no relief, but composed of many gentle ascents, which, in the spring and summer, are covered with verdure, and interspersed with little groves, that give a pleasing variety to the prospect. 
At a little distance below the falls is a small island, about one acre and an half, on which grow a great number of oak trees, all the branches of which, able to bear the weight, are in the proper season of the year loaded with eagle's nests. Their instinctive wisdom has taught them to choose this place, as it is secure, on account of the rapids above, from the attacks either of man or beast.]

It was partly destroyed, and partly carried away, by General Sir Henry Clinton, in October 1777. Also the name given to the point of a mountain on the n. bank of Mohawk river, about 30 miles above Schenectady. Around this point runs the stage road.] 

[==[[Anticosti|ANTICOSTI]]==, a barren, uninhabited island, in the mouth of St. Lawrence river. It is, however, of very considerable size, being 120 miles long, and SO broad.. The French formerly had a settlement on this island, but at present it is uninhabited; nor can it ever become of much importance, as it does not possess a single harbour where a vessel can ride in safety. The wood which grows upon it is small, and the soil is reckoned unfruitful ; which, added to the severity of the winter, will ever prove serious obstacles to its colonization/) .

==[[Antigua|ANTIGUA]]==, an island of the N. sea, one of the Small Antillas, called by the English, who possess it, Antego. It is six or seven leagues long, and nearly the same broad. It is of difficult access for vessels, on account of the currents and shallows with which it abounds. It was first thought uninhabitable from a supposed want of water ; but the English, who established themselves in it, discovered some fountains, and the inhabitants, who may amount to about 900 persons, have made many wells and cisterns for preserving the rain water. It abounds in every kind of fish, and one of a peculiar sort, which they call perro de mar, or seadog, from its devouring the other fish, and even the fishermen, on which account the bathing here is very dangerous. It has some Very good ports and bays, such as the bays of St. John and Willoughby, and the ports English and Falmouth. It has also a species of sea woodcock, which has a beak similar to that bird, the upper part of which is much larger than the lower ; it moves either jaw with equal ease ; and some have been seen four feet long, and 12 inches wide towards the head ; they have two fins on each side, and a large one upon the belly, rising like the crest of a cock, and extending from the head to the tail : but what is most extraordinary, is the hard beak with two sharp and black horns, nearly aninch and an half each, which the creature has the power of withdrawing with pleasure into its belly, this serving as a scabbard ; it has no scales, but a black and rough skin upon its back. This island abounds also with a variety of birds j and that which is the most common, is peculiarly beautiful to behold, having the upper part of the wings and belly of a golden colour, the other half and the back of skyblue, the tail and long feathers of the wings of a mixture of a very bright red and blue, and studded with other feathers of gold ; but the most singular feature is its head, which is covered with a sort of dark bonnet, fringed with green, yellow, and clear blue; it has also a variegated beak ; there is a ring of white round the eyes, and the pupil is of a beautiful yellow and red, having the appearance of a ruby set in gold ; and upon the head is a plume of feathers, of the colour of vermillion, and others of the colour of pearls. This bird is about the size of a pheasant. — The climate is hot, unsalutary, and is very subject to hurricanes, similar to that    ANTIGUA.  dreadful one which happened in 1707. It is not deficient in cattle, and its wild wax is similar to that of Mainas. This island was first discovered, about the year 1623, by Sir Thomas Warner, and the English established themselves in it in 1636. The king of England granted* it, in 1663, to William Willoughby, who sent to it, in 1666, a numerous colony to people it. It was the same year attacked and ravaged by the French, from whom it was retaken, in 1690, by Christopher Codrington. In 1736, three Indians, by name Court, Tombay, and Hecules, entered into a conspiracy to put some gunpowder in a situation that it might explode and blow up a saloon in which the governor was giving a ball and entertainment ; but it was timely discovered, and the conspirators met with the punishment they deserved. [Antigua lies between lat. 17° and 17° 12' n. and between long. 61° 38' and 61° 53' w. ; is situate about 20 leagues to the e. of St. Christopher's ; and was discovered at the same time with that island by Columbus himself, who named it from a church in Seville, Santa Maria de la Antigua. We are informed by Ferdinand Columbus, that that the Indian name was Jamaica. It is a singular circumstance, that this word, which in the language of the larger islands signified a country abounding in springs, should, in the dialect of the Charibbes, have been applied to an island that has not a single spring or rivulet of fresh water in it, notwithstanding what Alcedo asserts. 
This inconvenience, without doubt, as it rendered the country uninhabitable to the Charibbes, deterred for some time the European adventurers in the neighbouring islands from attempting a permanent establishment in Antigua ; but nature presents few obstacles which the avarice or industry of civilized man will not endeavour to surmount. The lands were found to be fertile, and it was discovered that the water preserved in the cisterns was wonderfully light, pure, and wholesome. So early as 1632, a few English families took up lands there, and began the cultivation of tobacco. 
But the settlement was nearly strangled in its infancy. The attack by the French, in 1666, has been already mentioned. It was then that the island was invaded and ravaged with fire and sword. All the Negroes that could be found were taken away ; and the inhabitants, after beholding their houses and estates in flames, were plundered even to the clothes on their backs and the shoes on their feet } without regard to sex or age.  
Its recovery from this calamity was owing chiefly to the enterprising spirit and extensive views of Colonel Codrington of Barbadoes. This gentleman removing to Antigua about the year 1674, applied his knowledge in sugarplanting with such good effect and success, that others, animated by his example, and assisted by his advice and encouragement, adventured in the same line of cultivation. Mr. Codrington was some years afterwards nominated captaingeneral and commanderinchief of all the Leeward Charibbean islands ; and deriving from the appointment the power of giving greater energy to his benevolent purposes, had soon the happiness of beholding the good effects of his humanity and wisdom, in the flourishing condition of the several islands under his government. 
The prosperity of Antigua was manifested in its extensive population; for when, in the year 1690, General Codrington commanded on the expedition against the French inhabitants of St. Christopher's, Antigua furnished towards it no less than 800 effective men : a quota which gives room to estimate the whole number of its white inhabitants, at that time, at upwards of 5000. 
About 34,000 acres of land in this island are appropriated to the growth of sugar, and pasturage annexed ; its other principal staples are cottonwool, ginger, and tobacco; and they raise in favourable years great quantities of provisions. 
This island contains two different kinds of soil : the one a black mould on a substratum of clay, which is naturally rich, and when not checked by excessive droughts, to which Antigua is particularly subject, very productive ; the other is a stiff clay on a substratum of marl ; it is much less fertile than the former, and abounds with an irradicable kind of grass, in such a manner, that many estates, consisting of that kind of soil, which were once \cry profitable, are now so impoverished and overgrown with this sort of grass, as either to be converted into pasture land, or to become entirely abandoned. Exclusive of such deserted land, and a small part of the country that is altogether unimprovable, every part of the island may be said to be under cultivation. 
The island is divided into six parishes and 11 districts. The parishes are, St. John's, St. Mary's, St. George, St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. Philip. It has six towns and villages : St. John's, (the capital), Parham, Falmouth, Willoughby Bay, Old Bay, Old Road, and James Fort ; the two first of which are legal ports of entry. No island in this part of the West Indies can boast of so] l 2   

ANTIGUA.  
[many excellent harbours ; of these the principal are English harbour and St. John's, both well fortified ; and at the former are a royal navy yard and arsenal, with conveniences for careening ships of war. The military establishment generally consists of two regiments of infantry, and two of foot militia. There are likewise a squadron of dragoons, and a battalion of artillery, both raised in the island ; and the regulars receive additional pay, as in Jamaica. The governor or captaingeneral of the Leeward Gharibbean islands generally resides in Antigua, but visits occasionally each island within his government ; and in hearing and determining causes from the other islands, presides alone. He is chancellor of each island by his office ; but in causes arising in Antigua, he is assisted by his council, after the practice of Barbadoes ; and the president, together with a certain number of the council, may determine chancery causes during the absence of the go-  vernorgeneral. The other courts of this island are, a court of king's bench, a court of common pleas, and a court of exchequer. The church of the United Brethren lias been very successful in converting to Christianity many of the Negro slaves of this and the other islands. 
It is difficult to furnish an average return of the crops of this island, which vary to so great a degree, that the quantity of sugar exported in different years has been from 2500 to 18,000 hogsheads. Thus, in 1779, were shipped 338-1 hogsheads and 579 tierces; in 1782, the crop was 15,102 hogsheads and 1603 tierces; and in the years 1770, 1773, and 1778, there were no crops of any kind ; all the canes being destroyed by a long continuance of dry weather, and when the whole body of Negroes would have been in danger of perishing for want of food, if American vessels with com and flour had been at that time denied admittance.

Almost all enjoy a benign temperature, and ihd cold of winter is unknown to them. The fields preserve an everlasting verdure, and the soil is fertile in every kind of production, particularly in sugar, brandy, cotton, ginger, indigo, coffee, and tobacco ; these being the principal branches of commerce. Besides the abovementioned islands, are those of Anegada, Sombrero, Saba, Granadilla, and others much smaller, which are, more properly speaking, little isles or rocks. At the time of their discovery they were peopled by Indian Charibbes, who are cannibals of a very fierce nature; a few of whom still keep possession of some of the smaller ' isles. The Europeans established themselves irf them in 1625, after that the Spaniards had kept in their possession some of the principal of them irom the time they were first discovered. They have since been colonized by the English, French, Dutch, and Danish, and numbers of Negroes have been brought from the coast of Africa to labour in them ; these latter forming the greater part of their population. Although the vine has been brought hither, the wine produced from it is not found to keep. These islands are extremely subject to violent hurricanes, and it is seldom that five years elapse without some deplorable calamity taking place.

==[[Apalaches|APALACHES]]==, a nation of Indians of Florida, in the territory of its name ; dwelling on the side of a chain of rugged mountains.

They have for their dwellings  certain edifices of an  oblong  square figure, the  extremities of which universally point due n. and s&gt;. so that they are little molested by these winds, which, indeed, are here the most prevalent. The pavement is simple and elegant ; being made of calcined shells, and of a sort of sand of a gold colour, which they collect from the mountains, forming from it a paste, which, being spread upon the ground, and becoming dry, emits a colour as brilliant as though it were a plate of gold. The A PA clothing and household fur&amp;iture oftbesc Indians consists of the skins of the beasts of the mountains : although they have abundance of vines, they are very sober, from their ignorance in what manner to make use of them, and commonly drink nothing but water : they are accustomed to give their male children the names of the enemies they have conquered, or of some hostile settlement which they have plundered and burnt: they maintain the strictest faith in war ; nor are they excited to this by a slight pretext, neither through a spirit of avarice or of conquest, but only when they are obliged for their own defence, or for the just satisfaction of injuries received. These Indians have never known the barbarous method of poisoning their arrows; they treat their prisoners with humanity, and their wives and children in the same manner as their servants: some assert that they are very longlived, and that it is common lor them to reach a century : they adore the sun, to which they sing hymns every morning and evening ; but at present they have a religion, which is a mixture of their own with the catholic and some protestant sects.

Being formed of all these, it takes the name of the Apure for upwards of 300 leagues through the extensive llanos of San Juan, and, overwhelmed by the weight of its waters, rushes through a forest, and empties itself into the Aguarico, which flows in a small stream from the province of Caracas, and is not navigable until it receives these additional waters : it then, in an unrestrained course, runs 20 leagues further, and enters, by very rapid streams and by three mouths, into the Orinoco. Its rush is indeed so violent, that, although it be there a league in width, the Orinoco resigns its current entirely to the influence of the waters of the Apure for upwards of a league, when the fury of this river being somewhat abated by dreadful whirlpools, (at which even the dexterous and crafty Indian has been known to shudder), it runs for the space of three leagues more amicably with the Orinoco ; its waters, however, being yet distinguishable, from their bright and crystal appearance, until, being further commixed by the rocks of the current of Aguarico, they become at length inseparably confounded with the sombre stream of the Orinoco.

-&gt;   opposite the settlement of San Antonio dc Cocuisas, and on the s. side, this river throws out an arm, which is called Apurito, through which it discharges nearly a fourth part of its waters ; and thus' separating itself from the mother stream, it traverses a great part of those llanos, sometimes in the main branch, and at others divided into various lesser streams, forming sundry islands \ t and these again uniting, receive the Avaters of the Arauca, which flows down from the llanos of Cazanare, and enters the Orinoco. The main body of the Apurc, after receiving the river Portuguesa, throws out an arm to the n. which runs to unite itself with the Guarico, in the province of Venezuela, and then empties itself into the Orinoco. The regulars of the company of the Jesuits did not find any settlements of missionaries on the shore of this river, as, in fact, all the settlements that were founded by them were at some distance from it. £The Apure (observes Depons) rises in the neighbouring mountains of St. Christopher, belonging to the kingdom of Santa Fe ; its length is 170 leagues, of whicli 40 are from n. e. to s. e. and the remainder from w. to e. it then takes its course to the s. to join the Orinoco. It is navigable for more than 60 leagues, and in its course increases the volume of its waters by a number of other rivers, of which some are also navigable, and the more useful, because, after having irrigated a great part of Venezuela, they serve for the conveyance of the produce which springs from the luxuriance they afford to the soil. These rivers are the Tinaco, San Carlos, Cojeda, Aguablanca, Acarigua, Are, Yaruo, Hospiria, Abaria, Portuguesa, Guanare, Tucupido, Bocono, Masparro, La Yuca, St. Domingo, Paguey, Tisnados, &amp;c. These successively confound their waters in the immense plains of Venezuela. Almost the whole of them are united above Santiago, and form a considerable volume of water, which, at twelve leagues below that place falls into the Apure, 20 leagues n. of the Orinoco. -This quantity of water being too much for the bed of the Apure to contain, is forced into a division of many branches, and so falls by several mouths into the Orinoco. The cattle bred upon the banks of the Apure, and of the other rivers which lose their names in joining its waters, consist of numerous droves, and are highly esteemed. They are principally oxen, horses, and mules, but chiefly the latter. Their exportation is naturally by Guayana, through the accommodation of the pastures in that route up to the Orinoco. All the part of Venezuela, forming the new province of Barinas, and even all its s. part, are invited by the facility of the transport to send their coffee,   cotton, and indigo, to Guayana, instead of carrying them on mules to Caracas or Puerto Caballo, over a hundred leagues, on roads almost impracticable, and crossed by rivers nearly unbounded.]

Some have maintained that this river is truly the Maranon, founding their opinion on its remote origin. It traverses the high road which leads from Lima to Cuzco, and other provinces of the sierra. It is crossed by a bridge, made of thongs or cords, of 80 yards long and three wide, at which there is paid a toll of four reals for every parcel of goods of the country, and 12 reals for such as are of Spain. Some bagres are caught in this river.

[==[[Araucai|ARAUCAI]]==, a river of the province of Chaco in Peru. It is an arm of the Pilcomayo.] 
==[[Araucanos|ARAUCANOS]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians, of the kingdom of Chile, who inhabit the country lying s. of the river Biobio, in the mountains of the Andes, extending also over the plains. They are the implacable enemies of the Spaniards, who have never been able to reduce or subject them. On the contrary, whenever their country has been invaded, they have manfully resisted their enemies, committing the most terrible slaughter and execution amongst them, destroying their cities and forts, laying waste their lands, and never sparing the life of a Spaniard. The women, indeed, they reserve for their own use, as happened in the years 1599 and 1720. They are faithless and traitorous^ but of incredible valour and resolution. The first peace which was made with them, from an idea that it was impossible to reduce them to subjection, took place in 1641 ; Don Francisco de Tuniga, Marques de Baydes, Conde del Pedroso, being president, governor, and captaingeneral of the kingdom. In 1650 a peace was concluded for the second time, but which was broken a short time after, like the first. Before the rebellion of 1720, the missionaries of the Jesuits had formed, with inconceivable trouble and dangers, five large settlements of these Indians ; but every thing was lost by this revolution, and a third peace was afterwards established in 1724. This lasted till 1767, when it was also broken. These Indians were ac- 2    *&gt;   customed to carry on a trade with the Spaniards, exchan°-in°- their manufactures of wool, and their horses, nof inferior to those of the famous Andalucian breed, for wine, leather, and earthen ware. They have no chief or head to govern them : all military authority rests in their elders, to whom they pay the same respect as though they were the fathers of the country, and from them, in times of war, they select a general or commander, whom they call toquil, and he is the arbiter both of war and of peaee. His armies are formed from the various tribes, and meet together with the utmost quietness ; they are composed ot cavalry and infantry ; their first attack is terrible, especially that of the foremost ranks ; they have some few fire arras and swords, but the principal and most common weapon is a long and thick lance, which they manage with great dexterity. They are robust, handsome, and liberal, but much addicted to inebriety and sensuality ; nevertheless the men, as well as the women, live honestly after their fashion. The Spaniards, to defend themselves against theninvasions, have built some forts upon the confines, furnished with men and artillery ; ancl in its district is celebrated, once a year, a kind ot tair, at which a meeting is made between the president ot Chile and the ancients of these Indians, to ratify the treaties of peace ; and the former makes, in the name of the king, various presents of leather, wine, and cloths of different colours. The number of inhabitants is very considerable, as well through the polygamy that prevails here, as that the climate contributes to propagation. In its district are mines of gold of excellent quality, but they are not worked. [In the s. provinces of the Araucanos, between the river Biobio and the Arch inelaooof Chiloe, several very rich mines ot gold were* formerly discovered, which yielded immense sums ; but since the expulsion of the Spaniards from 'those provinces by the Araucanos, these mines have been in the possession of that warlike people, who have prohibited the opening them anew by any one under pain of death. In the territory of these Indians is the Quito rush, of which they make excellent lances ; also a shrub producing honey, and the boighe tree, which they have from time immemorial, considered sacred, carrying its branches in their hands on the conclusion of °a peace, as the ancient nations of Europe did those of the olive. See a complete history of their manners, Sfc. in article Chile.] 
ARAUCO. a settlement of the province and government of Tucuman, in the district of the city of Rioja. It is fertile in wine ot excellent quality,   but in every thing besides very poor ; for which reason they petitioned the king, as arbitrator in their cause, to provide for this unproductiveness of soil by encouraging their mines, and, for this purpose, allowing them to avail themselves of the mule trade carried on between the jurisdiction of Cordova and Peru. 4 Ak ^ on the shores of the river Tucapel, built for the purpose of restraining the invasions of the infidel Indians.

The situation of Araure is fine, agreeable, and advantageous. Three rivers water its territory, which is fertile, but of which the inhabitants are far from making every advantage. Their principal and almost sole occupation is the rearing of cattle. They cultivate only some cotton and a little coffee. The ground of the city is regular and agreeable. The streets are straight. It has a handsome square. The houses are well built ; but the only thing worthy of note is the church, which is superb, and famed for the image of our Lady of Corteza, who enjoyes the public veneration, not only of all the faithful of the city, but also of all those in the surrounding villages, although the fame of her power and miracles are not equal to those ascribed to our Lady of Comoroto.]

AREQU1PA, a province and government of Peru, bounded on the n. by that of Collaguas, e. by that of Lampa, s. by that of Moquehua and that of Arica, w. by the S. sea, and n. w. by the province of Cumana. It is 16 leagues in length from n. w. to s. e. and IS in width at the most. On its coast is a port, which is insecure, and two creeks. Its productions, and in which it carries on a commerce with the other provinces, are reduced to wine, of which 500,000 jars, containing each 22 flasks, are made annually in the valleys of Arequipa, Moquegua, Locumba, Victor, Tacar, Liguas Mages, &amp;c. It abounds also in wheat, sugar, maize, and potatoes, but not in meats ; and therefore it is obliged to bring these hither from other parts. Its jurisdiction contains only 11 settlements; and it is watered by the river Tambo, which gives its name to a very fertile valley, through which it passes ; and by the Chile, which is formed from the water which distils from a cavity of a great rock, which, on the outside, is extremely dry. 
The capital is the city properly called Arequipay, which means to say, " It is well, remain ;" because, in one of the conquests of the Incas, the victorious army passing through these parts, many  of the captains, attracted by the beauty of the country, asked permission to form a settlement here, when they received for answer, "Arequipay." The Spaniards founded this city by order of Francisco Pizarro, in 1336, in the valley of Quilca, at 20 leagues distance from the S. sea, on the skirt of the mountain called Ornate, which is loftier than the others of the mountains of the sierra which surround it. This mountain, although always covered with snow, vomited fire at the time of the conquest. The chronoleger Antonio tie Herrera says, that this city was founded in 1534, and Don Antonio de Ulloa, in 1539 ; but one and the other have erred, and we follow the friar Antonio Calancha, who affirms the first mentioned date by original documents. Its temperature, notwithstanding its continual rains, is notoriously dry, and very benign and salutary. Its edifices are handsome, and built of stone ; the dwellinghouses being somewhat like arched vaults, and having no upper stories, so as to be prepared against the effects of earthquakes. It is watered by the river Chile, which is let off by sluices to irrigate the environs, and to enrich the fields. It was subjected to the bishopric of Cuzco till the year 1577, when Gregory XV. erected it into a cathedral, its first bishop being Don Francisco Antonio de Ervia, of the order of St. Domingo. This authority was immediately extinguished, and then it became subject to its former dependency until the year 1609, when it again became the head seat of a bishopric, the influence of which extends as far as the provinces of its name, and of those of Cufhana, Condesuyos, Cailloma, Moquega, and Arica. The Emperor Charles V. gave it the title of city, on the 15th May 1541, granting it for arms, in 1549, a volcano vomiting fire from a mountain surrounded by a river. It has a beautiful fountain of brass in the Plaza Mayor, or chief square, and a bridge of magnificent arches upon the river ; three parishes, and convents of San Francisco, San Domingo, San Augustin, La Merced, and San Juan de Dios ; a college which belonged to the regulars of the company of Jesuits, of Recoletos de San Francisco, on the other side of the river ; an hospital of Agonizantes, and a college for the instruction of youth ; monasteries of nuns of Santa Catalina, Santa Teresa, and Santa Rosa ; a house of correction for women, a religious house (beaterio) of Indians, and two houses of labour, both for men and women, lately founded. In the city is preserved, among its archives, a precious monument of some royal letters patent, in which Philip II. returned thanks to this city for its having, in times of necrs.- sity, supplied to the crown abundant relief, and

Martin in Lima, and Oidor of Panama. This city has been sundry times destroyed by earthquakes, in the years 1582, 1600, 1604, 1687, H25, 1732, and 1738. It is 217 leagues s.e. of Lima, 60 from Cuzco, and 50 w. of Arica. Long. 71° 58'. Lat. 16° 16' s. It rains here only in the months of December, January and February. Its settlements, which are in its vicinity or suburbs, are, Chiuhata, Paucarpata, 
Yanahuaya, Valle de Victor,

==[[Arica|ARICA]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru, bounded on the n. by that of Moquehua, n.w. by the jurisdiction of Arequipa, w. by the S. sea, s. by the province of Atacamas, s. e. by that of Lipes, and e. by that of Pecajes. It is in hngth 82 leagues n. w. s. e. and J6 in width e. w. It is composed, as are the other provinces on the coast, of valleys, which begin in the uneven grounds and windings of the cordillera, and which, for the most part, terminate on the shore of the S. sea. The parts lying between the valleys in this province are dry and unfruitful, and only serve for pastures in those months in which the gently sprinkling rain falls which is called garuay from May to September. In those valleys, which are, generally speaking, fertile, since they do not suffer from drought, is grown a sufficient supply of wheat, maize, and other seeds; also much Guiney pepper is cultivated, with which a commerce is carried on with the other provinces of the sierra, and a good quantity of cotton, olives, and sugar. In the 17th century, the aforesaid pepper grown on this province might be reckoned to produce the yearly value of 200,000 dollars. It does not want for wines or brandies ; and of the vine plant, the most celebrated is that of the valley of Locumba, on account of its flavour. In the mountains towards the Cordillera, cattle of the larger and smaller sort are bred, also native sheep. It has the fruits peculiar to its temperature, such as papas and some wheat, especially in the curacy of llabaya, by which the adjoining town of Moquehua finds a regular supply. In order to render the land fertile, the husbandmen make use of huano, which is the dung of birds called huanaes, and is brought from an island close upon the coast, called Iqueine.  *&gt;  This province has very few rivers, and only two of any consideration, one in the valley of Loa, whore the province is bordered by that of Atacama, and another which flows down through the valley of Locumba, and is composed of two great streams, which flow in directions nearly contrary to each other, and form a very deep lake of four leagues and an half in width, at the end of which is a deep cavity, from which issues, with an immense force, the stream forming the river of Locumba, which continues running with an equally abundant supply. This province has to the e. a volcano in a very lofty mountain, from the skirts of which spring forth some fetid hot waters; but what are most worthy of note are its mines. In the mountains of the curacy of Pica, are veins of gold, and of the finest copper, neither of which are worked, on account of the hardne6s of their temper. In the part upon the coast are two - mountains, namely, of Chanavaya and of Huantajaya, two leagues, more or less, from the sea, and some others ; all of which are very rich in metals, which are nevertheless not worked, owing to the scarcity of water experienced in this territory for many leagues. The second of these mountains is supposed to have been dug in former times ; the attempt has been repeated in the present age, but without method ; it being imagined that there were no regular veins of metal in it, but merely some lumps, since some of these had been found lying detached indifferent parts. Of late, however, some strata of metal have been discovered, and it is seen that the lumps which were first picked out, were only the forerunners or indicators of better fortune. From hence there has been a regular establishment of labourers, and much riches have been, and still continue to be/extracted from this mine ; and were it not that, owing to the want of water, the labourers are obliged to carry the metals to be worked at a great distance, and through unpeopled parts, the masters would be much enriched, the kingdom would be benefited, and the demand for workmen much larger. This province comprehends 46 settlements and various ports. Its repartimiento used to amount to 880,900 dollars. The settlements of this jurisdiction are,

[==[[Arkansas|ARKANSAS|Arkensas]]==, a n. w. branch of Mississippi river, of a very lengthy course, which falls in by two mouths, and forms an island. Thirtyfive miles long, and ten broad. The branch on the n. e. side of the island receives White river, about 24 miles from its mouth. The course of the river Arkansas, with its meanders, Major Pike computes at 1981 miles, from its junction with the Mississippi (or rather the Missouri) to the mountains ; and from thence to its source 192 ; the total length being 2173 miles : the former portion to the mountains may be navigated. It also receives several rivers, which are navigable for more than 100 miles. The banks of the Arkansas swarm with buffaloes, elks, and deer, in numbers which seem inexhaustible by the hunting tribes. Near the sources of this river is a prodigious mountain, well known by the savages for many hundred miles around. The altitude was observed on a base of a mile, and found to be 10,581 feet above the Prairie ; and admitting the Prairie to be 8000 feet above the sea, the height of this peak would be 18,581 feet. But when our author on this occasion mentions the peak of Teneriffe, he forgets the authentic observations of La Crenne, and other astronomers employed by the French king, who have sufficiently ascertained that the height of the peak of Teneriffe is only 1742 toises, or 10,452 French feet, above the level of the sea. It is the detached and insular situation which makes this peak appear higher than it really is. If it approached nearly to the height of Mont Blanc, 15,500 feet, the difficulty of the ascent would be such, that four days would not be more than sufficient to go and return ; whereas there is no hint of any such circumstance. But it is almost necessary to apologize for any such observations on the work of our enterprising traveller. One man cannot unite every qualify ; and a scientific traveller might have perished amidst the difficulties which were surmounted by his courage and perseverance. The distresses suffered by him and his companions, amidst those mountains covered with eternal snow, were terrible ; famine daily staring them in the face ; while their clothing was exhausted, the blood started from under the bandages of their o 2      ARM snowshoes, and some of the men even lost their feet by the severity of the frost. [Arkansas, arelndians who live on the Arkansa river, s. side, in three villages, about 12 miles above the post or station. The name of the first village is Tawanima, second Oufotu, and the third Ocapa ; in all, it is believed, they do not at present exceed 100 men, and are diminishing. They are at war with the Osages, but friendly with all other people, white and red ; are the original proprietors of the country on the river, all which they claim, for about 300 miles above them, to the junction of the river Cadwa with Arkansas ; above this fork the Osages claim. Their language is Osage. They generally raise corn to sell ; are called honest and friendly people.]

It is divided into High and Low. The first is of a cold temperature, abounding in fruits of the sierra, in seeds and potatoes. In the cordillera are numerous flocks of ostriches and vicunas, which the Indians hunt, selling their skins and eating their flesh, which is tender and welltasted. The bezoarstone is also found here. Although the aforesaid animals are extremely nimble, they are nevertheless hunted with great ease ; and it is performed in this as well as in other provinces by simply fixing upright, by means of stones, some small sticks of about two yards long, in a narrow pass ; and attaching to each a thread or cord, they tie at small distances pieces of coloured wool, which is moved about by the wind. The trap being thus prepared, the hunters endeavour to frighten the vicunas from different parts into this valley, where, as soon as they arrive, being completely overcome with terror at the bits of wool, the whole of the troop remain prisoners, this trifling barrier forming an insurmountable obstacle to their escape. The hunters then make use of a cord, somewhat more than a yard long, having a stone attached to the extremity, which they sling round the feet of the vicunas, which being thus fast entangled, are easily taken. If, by accident, an huanaco is found amongst the troop, the whole are lost, for he immediately darts through the barrier, and the rest, follow him.

It has its origin and source in the mountains of the province of Choco, from two lakes which form the rivers Quito and San Pablo, which latter become immediately united. It runs nearly straight from s. to n. for more than 95 leagues, and empties itself into the N. sea ; collecting in its course the waters of the Tigre, Torren, and Pequest, the waters of the lake  Luina, and several other streams of such magnitude as to cause it to form a mouth upwards of five leagues broad, in the great bay or gulph called Darien, near the limits which divide the two governments and jurisdictions of Cartagena and Pamana. This river, which in that country is also known by the names of Darien and Choco, is navigable for many leagues ; but its navigation is prohibited on pain of death, without any exception whatever, in order to avoid any prejudice which might arise to the provinces of the Nuevo Reyno, by means of the facility with which this kingdom might be thus entered. Neverthless the viceroy of that kingdom, Don Manuel Guiriol, proposed that this passage should be free and open, though with the proper precautions against any probable mischief.

The valley of Atrisco, celebrated for its beauty and fertility, has cultivated estates which produce immense abundance of wheat, maize, barley, and other grains, by which other provinces are supplied,  t~?      these being the principal sources of trade in this province ; and although it is not without a sufficient quantity of flax and hemp, yet of these little is made ; nor indeed does the small attention ■which is paid to their cultivation, warrant the expectation of any considerable emolument to be derived from them. In the estates are 150 families of Spaniards, and innumerable parties of Indians, who assist in their cultivation. It abounds also in large and small cattle, and its woods in hares, rabbits, partridges, and other birds. It is watered by several large rivers, from which not only the estates, but also all the gardens of the greater part of the settlements of its district, derive great benefit.

==[[Atropiche|ATROPICHE]]==, a small river of the province and government of Guayana, or Nueva Andalucia. It runs from s. to n. and enters the Orinoco, on the side of the new city of San Gabriel de Guayana. ■ [ATTAK APAS. See At ac apas.] [ATTLEBOROUGH. See Artlebtjrgh.] ==[[Atropiche|ATUNCANAR]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Cuenca in the kingdom of Quito. It is of an agreeable and healthy temperature, abounding in productions, especially in sugarcanes and cochineal. In the time of the IncasofPeru, it was a very wealthy population, having a temple dedicated to the sun, a palace and a fort, of which the ruins still remain, at the distance of two leagues towards the n. and which is the most regular, capacious, and well constructed of any in that kingdom. At the entrance. of this fort, and in the front, is a small river, which runs close up to its walls ; and on the opposite side it is terminated by a moderately lofty till, and hemmed in by a strong wall. Nearly in the centre is a turret of an oval figure, which rises on the interior of the wall to about the height of two toises, and to six or eight on the exterior. In the middle of it is a square inclosed by walls, which, towards the part which looks into the country, has all its angles touching the circumference of the oval, without leaving any pass ; and there is, indeed, nothing left on the other side save a very narrow way. In the middle of the square is a division forming two small apartments, which have no communication with each other ; and they are entered by a door placed at the side opposite the division. In the sides which front the country are small holes, which served as a watching place, and where, to all appearance, a guard used to be mounted. Close upon the exterior of this oval runs the wall, to the extent of 40 toises on the left hand, and 25 on the right. This wall afterwards becomes doubled, forming different irregular angles, and including a large space. Close to the rocky place from which the river has its source, is a gate or entrance, and near to this runs a narrow pass, where two persons only can go abreast ; and this pass, when it comes to the opposite wall, turns about and leads to the tower, being still of the same breadth. It afterwards inclines rather towards the rocky place, but at length widening, forms an half plain before the same tower. In this narrow pass, at the distance of three feet from each other, are disposed niches, formed in the solid wall like sentry boxes, and in another part of the wall are two gates, which are capable of admitting very large stores and accommodations for the lodging of the troops. The interior space is formed into various compartments, and from the height of the walls, the gates, and the nice economy which prevails, the whole fabric seems evidently to have been the habitation of some prince. All the walls are full of holes, and there are many small stones of six or eight inches long, and three or four broad, jetting out from their sides, and which no doubt served as pegs, upon which the soldiers might hang up their arms. The whole of the wall is very thick, having a fine parapet and a deep ditch without, and a very capacious terrace within ; and although there is a way entirely round the top, it has only one entrance, namely, by means of a staircase close to the oval tower, which, after rising some steps, forms the main staircase for the tower itself. The structure, as well of the walls as of the interior buildings, is entirely of unequal stones of irregular figure ; but these are so neatly and so firmly put together, that it is scarcely possible to perceive where they are joined. Opposite this settlement, the Inca Atahualpa conquered his brother Huascar, and put to the sword 60,000 of his vassals. In its district towards the e. is an estate called Bueran.

This fishery can be carried on only in the day, as the fish will not bite in the (lark. It is also peculiar to the spring season, and ends in September, since in the winter these fish like the bottom of the sea.

==[[Bahamas|BAHAMAS]]==, Islands of the N. sea, situate to the e. of, and opposite to Florida. They are of the Lucayos, and were discovered by Columbus, in his first voyage, in 1404. From them the fine channel of Bahama takes its name, the same being formed by the above coast, the principal of these islands, and along sandbank of the same name, to the n. of the island of Cuba, and being 16 leagues wide and 45 long. The currents in the gulph are most violent, and in it numbers of vessels have been wrecked. It is the direct pass into the open sea, and for the route tp Europe. It was first attempted by the celebrated pilot Anton de Alaminos, who risked its navigation with imminent hazard, when he went to Spain with the agents of Hernan Cortes, to give account to the Emperor Charles V. of the progress of the conquest of Mexico. The principal island is 13 leagues long and eight wide ; is very fertile, of an agreeable climate, and full of streams and rivulets. It formerly produced much sassafras, zarzaparrilla, and red wood; but its present productions are principally maize, birds, and a kind of rabbit ; and it procures for itself other necessaries from Carolina. Its principal commerce consists in supplying provisions to ships which come here for convenience. Although these islands are near 500, many of them are nothing but cliffs or rocks.

The Bahama islands have never been correctly set down or delineated in any of the maps or charts of the West Indies. Many of them are situated upon the Great Bahama bank, others upon the Little Bahama bank, and others out of soundings, in the Atlantic ocean. They stretch from Turk's islands (which are at no great distance from St. Domingo) in a n. w. direction to the n. end of the Great Bahama bank, near the coast of Florida. The climate is in general salubrious. The more n. of the islands during the winter months are rendered cool and agreeable by the n. w. breezes from the continent of America. At New Providence the thermometer, (Farenheit), in the shade, varies from about 85° or 90° in summer to 60° or 65° in winter. The more s. islands, however, are hotter throughout the year; but these enjoy the cooling sea breezes that blow in the West Indies within the tropics, and which do not extend to several of the most??, of the Bahamas. 
There is but little variety of soil throughout the Bahama islands. They are almost all low, flat, barren, and rocky. They are well provided with natural woods, generally however of a small growth. The soil is mostly either light and sandy, or very rocky and broken, with partial spots of good land. The rock is of a soft and porous nature, but hard, and generally irregular on the surface. The Bahamas are but ill supplied with]  

BAHAMAS.  [fresh water; it is found however by digging wells in the rocks, to the depth of the sea level, and also very often by making holes in the sand along the coasts, a few feet from the surface. In several of the islands are small natural freshwater ponds, produced by the rain collected from the rocks ; but there is not supposed to exist, throughout the Bahamas, a single spring of fresh water or rivulet. 
General History. — One of the Bahama islands (the ancient Indian name of which is stated to be Guanahani) has been generally fixed upon by historians and geographers as the spot where the first discovery of the new world took place, by Columbus, upon the 11th of October 1492. The island Avas named by him St. Salvador, by which appellation, as also that of Cat island, it is now generally known. There appears, however, to exist some doubt with respect to the point of land first actually discovered by Columbus in the new world. The accounts of his first voyage to America generally state that his squadron kept almost a due w. course from the Canary islands (the last land from which he took his departure) across the Atlantic ; and that, for two or three days before land was discovered, he found himself in soundings. It is also stated that he landed at a secure and spacious harbour, and that the island (St. Salvador) had verdant fields, watered with many rivulets. If these accounts were true, and if the island now known by that name was actually the land first discovered by Columbus, it may be concluded that some great change or convulsion must have taken place in that quarter of the world since its discovery. At present there are no soundings to the e. of St. Salvador ; and along the whole of the e. coast of that island, is a reef which would prevent any landing on that side. There is no harbour but a small one round the*, end of the island, facing the s. w. in one of the shallow Bahama banks. No verdant fields can now be found upon the island of St. Salvador, which is barren and rocky, like the rest of the Bahama islands ; throughout the whole of which, as was before observed, no rivulet of any description has been discovered. There can be no doubt, however, that one of the Bahama islands was the first land discovered by Columbus. The island of Abaco is situated nearer the latitude of the Canaries, and there is a good harbour on the e. side of that island ; but there are no soundings at any distance from the shore on that side. It is perhaps more likely that Abaco (or one of the other most n. of the Bahama islands) was the first point of discovery, particularly if it be true what is stated, that  a few days after he discovered land he touched at New Providence and Andros island (which it is said he named Fernandina and Isabella) in his way to Cuba ; and it is extremely improbable that he would touch at those islands in his way to Cuba from St. Salvador. 
The Bahama islands, when discovered by Columbus, are stated to have been inhabited by a numerous race of Indians, of a mild and peaceable disposition, indolent in their habits, and little, if at all, accustomed to the cultivation of the soil. They are described as being of a dark and dingy hue, with long black hair, and with their bodies painted with different colours. Many thousands of these unfortunate people are stated to have been carried over by the Spaniards, in their subsequent settlements, and compelled to work in the mines of S. America. The early accounts of the Bahama islands, after their discovery, are, however, extremely obscure. There appears scarcely any trace of the original Indian inhabitants. The earliest settlement of Europeans which took place in the Bahama islands, was under a patent of Charles II. (1668), which granted those islands to certain proprietary lords. Shortly after thatperiod, some attempts appear to have been made to cultivate several of the islands ; but, about the beginning of the last century, they were again without inhabitants. Some time afterwards, however, they became the resort of numerous pirates, Bucaniers, and freebooters ; the situation of these islands, from the difficulties of the navigation, and their being near the passages through which the valuable vessels returned to Europe, being welladapted for plunder and concealment. Among these pirates was the noted Captain Teach, known by the name of Blachbeard, who had the supreme command over them, and of whom, as well as of Captain Vane, and others who resorted to the Bahamas, a curious account may be found in Johnson's Lives of the Pirates, and in the History of the Bucaniers of America. 
For the purpose of protecting the trade, and destroying these nests of freebooters, Captain Woods Rogers was sent out from England as governor to the Bahamas, in the year 1718, and the seat of government was fixed at New Providence, upon which island Fort Nassau was built. From that period, a regular colonial administration appears to have taken place • but for a considerable time, little cultivation or improvement seems to have occurred at the Bahamas. 
The island of New Providence was taken possession of in the American war by an American captain. It was shortly afterwards, how-}     126

[ever, abandoned by its new possessor. In 1781 the Bahama islands were surrendered to the Spaniards, and restored to the British by treaty at the end of the war. Previous, however, to the notification of the treaty, New Providence and its forts were recovered by means of a very gallant and wellconducted enterprise, under the command of Lieutenantcolonel Deveaux of the S. Carolina militia. After the termination of the American war, many of the British loyalists, and other planters, repaired to the Bahamas, chiefly from the s. states of N. America, from which period most of the principal islands began to be regularly settled and inhabited. 
Productions. — The chief article which has been cultivated in this colony is cotton ; and for several years with very considerable success, though for some time past that success has greatly diminished, owing probably to the natural barrenness of the soil, and perhaps to the rains being less frequent from the woods, from many parts of these having been much cut down. The cultivation of sugar has been attempted, (particularly on the Caicos), but with little success. Coffee has been raised on several of the islands. Provisions, such as Guinea and Indian corn, yams, sweet potatoes, plantains, cassava, Indian and pigeon peas, grow in abundance. Most of the tropical fruits are found here; oranges, lemons, limes, shaddocks, pineapples, cocoa nuts, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Cattle and sheep thrive on most of the islands ; and the shores and creeks of all the Bahamas abound in turtle, and excellent fish of various sorts. Wild ducks, snipes, pelicans, gualdings, wild pigeons, flamingoes, and a variety of other birds, abound among the islands ; and among the woods are found wild hogs, agoutis, guanas, land crabs, &amp;c. Ambergris is frequently found cast ashore upon the coast. Various sorts of timber and dye woods are found growing in the Bahamas, such as mahogany, (generally of a small and very hard sort, commonly called Madeira and horseflesh mahogany), brazilletto, fustick, lignumvitae, Spanish oak, or black gregory, tamarind, lana wood, iron wood, wild cinnamon, pimento, or naked wood, yellow saunders, satin wood, pines, cedars, and many others adapted for building small vessels, and well calculated for the purposes of the mechanic and cabinetmaker. 
The principal and most valuable article which has, perhaps, of late years been exported from the Bahamas, is salt. In many of the islands there are valuable natural saltponds, to which the  attention of the inhabitants has been much directed, and for the subdivision and management of which, legislative and colonial regulations have been enacted. In dry and favourable seasons great quantities of salt are produced from these ponds, and exported by the Americans to the United States. 
Many of the small vessels of the Bahamas are not only employed as drogging (or carrying) vessels among the different islands, and in catching turtle, but also among the numerous passages, (particularly towards the Florida stream), in watching for wrecked vessels. They are licenced for this purpose by the governor of the Bahamas. Many valuable lives are saved by the exertions of these vessels, and much property secured for the owners and insurers of the ships employed in the West India trade, and those bound from Vera Cruz and the Havanah to Europe. 
Government and Statistics. — The colonial establishment of the Bahamas is similar to that of the other West India islands, consisting of a governor, a lieutenantgovernor, a council, and a legislative assembly. The following islands send representatives to the house of assembly : New providence, and the town of Nassau, eight;; Harbour island,  
Abaco, three ; St. Sal- ,two ; Exuma, three ; island  ,one ; Turk's  three ; Eleuthera, three vador, one ; Long islan Andros island, two ; Crooked Watling's island, one ; Caicos, one island, two. The courts of justice are similar also to those established in the rest of the West India colonies. There are four regular ports of entry in the Bahamas, viz. at New Providence, Great Exuma, at the Caicos, and at Turk's islands. Besides the usual garrison at New Providence, there is a militia established in several of the islands. Previous to May 1803, lands were granted by the crown in the whole of the Bahamas, to the amount of 265,381 acres, for the purpose of cultivation. The population at that time amounted to about 14,318, including 11,395 blacks and people of colour ; and it appears by a return to the house of commons in 1805, at a medium of two years to 1803, the number of slaves imported amounted to 2523, of whom 2230 were exported ; leaving a remainder of only 293 for the use of the colony.

[Bald Eagle is likewise the name of a river which runs a «„ e. course 44 miles, and falls into the w. branch of Susquehanna river. The head water of Huron river, which falls into lake Erie, is called Bald Eagle creek.] 
[Bald Eagle Valley, or, as it is commonly called. Sinking Spring Valley, lies upon the frontiers of Bedford county in Pennsylvania, about 200 miles w. from Philadelphia. It has on the e. a chain of high, rugged mountains, called the Canoe Ridge, and on the w. the Bald Eagle or Warrior mountains. This is a pleasant vale, of limestone bottom, five miles in extent where widest; and in the vicinity are great quantities of lead ore. It contained, in 1779, about 60 or 70 families, living in loghouses, who formed, in the space of seven or eight years, several valuable plantations, some of which are remarkably agreeable on account of their situation. During the late war with Great Britain, lead was much wanted, and very  difficult to be procured, which induced a company, under the patronage of the state, to settle here, and establish a regular set of works. A fort of logs was erected for the protection of the miners j and a considerable quantity of ore was produced, from which lead enough was made to give a competent idea of the real value of the mines in general. The danger of the situation, however, while an Indian war continued, occasioned the failure of the undertaking. The lead ore was of many kinds ; some in broad flakes, and others of the steely texture. Several regular shafts were sunk to a considerable depth ; one of which was on the hill upon which the fort was erected, and from which many large masses of ore were procured ; but not forming a regular vein, it was discontinued, and another opened about a mile from the fort, nearer to Frank's Town. Here the miners continued until they finally relinquished the business. When they first began, they found in the upper surface or vegetable earth several hundred weight of cubic lead ore, clean and unmixed with any substance whatever, which continued as a clue, leading them down through the different strata of earth, marl, &amp;c. until they came to the rock, which is here in general of the limestone kind. Among other curiosities of this place, is that called the Swallows, which absorb several of the largest streams of the valley, and after conveying them several miles under ground, in a subterrananeous course, return them again upon the surface. These subterraneous passages have given rise to the name Sinking Spring valley. Of these the most remarkable is called the Arch springs, and run close upon the road from thetown to the fort. It is a deep hollow formed in the limestone rock, about SO feet wide, with a rude natural stone arch hanging over it, forming a passage for the water, which it throws out with some degree of violence, and in such plenty as to form a fine stream, which at length buries itself again in the bowels of the earth. Some of these pits are near 300 feet deep ; the water at the bottom seems in rapid motion, and is apparently as black as ink, though it is as pure as the finest springs can produce. Many of these pits are placed along the course of this subterraneous river, which soon after takes an opportunity of an opening at a declivity of the ground, and keeps along the surface among the rocky hills for a few rods, then enters the mouth of a large cave, whose exterior aperture would be sufficient to admit a shallop with her sails full spread. In the inside it keeps from 1 8 to 20 feet wide. The roof declines as you advance, and a ledge of loose rugged rocks extends   in tolerable order on one side, affording means to scramble along. In the midst of this cave is much timber, bodies of trees, branches, &amp;c. which being lodged up to the roof of this passage, shews that "the water is swelled up to the very top during freshets. This opening in the hill continues about 400 yards, when the cave widens, after you have got round a sudden turning, (which prevents its being discovered till you are within it), into a spacious room, at the bottom of which is a vortex ; the water that falls into it whirling round with amazing force : sticks, or even pieces of timber, are immediately absorbed, and carried out of sight, the water" boiling up with excessive violence, and subsiding byj degrees, and at certain intervals. From the top of the Bald Eagle mountains is a fine prospect of those of the Alleghany, stretching along until they seem to meet the clouds. Much slate is found here, with strong signs of pit coal. Such as visit these parts must cross the Juniata river three or four times, from Standing Stone or Huntingdon to the fort, travelling a distance of about 22 miles.]

In this hollow grow lofty pines, which are overtopped by others, and rise at a greater or less distance above the brim of this basin. The woods are pretty well cleared near the springs. There is a large house for entertainment, with neat bathinghouses and showerbaths for the convenience of invalids. These, as also the greatest part of the valley, belong to an eminent merchant of New York ; the largest spring, however, belongs to the public. Sir William Johnson made this observation when he sold this tract of land to private individuals : " In tracing the history of these medicinal springs, 1 could only learn that an Indian chief discovered them to a sick French officer in the early part of their wars with the English : but whether they were these very springs in this basin, or those at ten miles distance, properly called the Saratoga springs, I know not." The soil for half a dozen miles round this place is poor and sandy, producing little else than pine trees, shruboaks, fern, and inullen. In the hills in the vicinity ores have been accidentally found, especially iron and copper, or rather what the mineralogists call ferruginous and cupreous pyrites. The valley of Balltown and its environs may be made an enchanting spot, equal, nay superior, in some respects, to any of the watering places in Europe. The Kayaderassoras river, which is about 10 yards wide, gives several hints to the man of taste, to turn its waters to the use and beauty of the future town, which these medicinal springs will one day raise in this place. The medicinal waters which have made this spot so famous of late are remarkably limpid, considering they contain iron, a mineral alkali, common salt, and lime. They are brisk and sparkling like champaigne. In drinking they affect the nose and palate like bottled beer, and slightly affect the head of some people by their inebriating quality. They derive this exhilarating quality from what Dr. Priestley calhjixedair, and is that animating something which gives activity to yeast, and life to malt liquors. It is used, in the neighbourhood of the springs, instead of yeast in making bread ; and  makes it rise more speedily and effectually thaa any other ferment in ordinary use. Horses drink these waters with avidity. The ignorant country people see, with astonishment, that a candle will not burn near the surface of these waters. Fish and frogs are killed in a few minutes, and geese and ducks can only swim in them a few minutes before they expire. These waters are apt to burst bottles when corked in very warm weather, especially during a thunder storm ; but with care may be transported in bottles to any distance. They boil with a very moderate degree of heat ; they are nevertheless remarkably cold ; for when the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer stood at 86° in the open air, and 79° in the brook running near the spring, it stood in one of these mineral springs at 49°, and in the other at 51° : the first was constantly excluded from the rays of the sun, the last always exposed without a covering. Physicians seldom direct their patients to drink more than three quarts of these waters in twelve hours ; but some drink the enormous quantity of three gallons, and even more, in a day. Cold as they are, they may be drank with safety in the hottest weather. They increase every natural evacuation, nay, they are cathartic, diuretic, and sudorific, at the same time. On the first trial they are apt to disagree with many people ; they create uneasiness in the stomach and bowels, and cause a heat in the glands of the throat, until they begin to pass off freely by the kidneys ; they then become pleasant, and" operate agreeably. They blacken the teeth and also the alvine fasces : they are deemed a specific in loss of appetite and indigestion : tbey are highly serviceable in hypochondriac cases, in obstructions, and in the stone and gravel, and cutaneous disorders : their credit is not so well established in the gout or rheumatism : they are hurtful in inflammatory disorders and consumptions : their use occasions heat in the glands of the throat, and stiffness of the neck ; and in such as are subject to the toothache, an aggravation of the pain : they are a powerful and precious remedy in the hands of the judicious, but ought never to be used without the advice of a skilful physician.]

Besides the rivers which bound it, and their branches, this county has Back and Middle rivers between the two former, but they are rather arms of Chesapeak bay than rivers. Back river, four or five miles e. of Patapsco, receives two small streams ; the northwesternmost is called Herring Run. Middle river has little or no supply of fresh water. There are numerous iron works in this county ; and it contains 25,434 inhabitants, including 587 slaves. lis chief town is Baltimore.] 
[Baltimore, the chief town in the above eounty, is the largest in the state of Maryland.  
In size it is the fourth, and in commerce the fifth in rank in the United States. It is situated on the n. side of Patapsco river, at a small distance from its junction with the Chesapeak : the entrance of the harbour is defended by Whetstone fort, hardly a pistolshot across, and of course may easily be defended against naval force. From the head of Elk river, at the head of the bay to Baltimore, is about 60 miles. The town is built around what is called the basin, reckoned one of" the finest harbours in America : the water rises five or six feet at common tides : it is divided into what is called the Town and Fell's point, by a creek, over which are two bridges, but the houses extend in an irregular manner from the one to the other. At Fell's point the water is deep enough for ships of burden, but small vessels only go up to the town. The situation is low, and was formerly thought unhealthy ; but by its rapid increase, improvements have taken place which have corrected the dampness of the air, and it is now judged to be tolerably healthy. In 1787 it contained 1955 dwellinghouses, of which 1200 were in the town, and th« rest at Fell's point. It then contained 1 52 storehouses. The number of the inhabitants of the town and precincts, in 1791, were 13,503, including 1255 slaves. The number of houses and inhabitants have been greatly increased since. Before the emigration of the French people from cape Francois, and other islands, the houses had increased to 2300. Those unfortunate people, flying from their merciless countrymen, who had burned and pillaged their cities and towns, and murdered their relations and friends, found here an hospitable asylum, after sufferings hardly paralleled in the annals of history. Here are nine places of public worship, which belong to Roman Catholics, German Calvinists and Lutherans, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists, Quakers, and Nicolites, or New Quakers, who all live together in peace. It is inhabited by people from most parts of Europe. The principal street is Market Street, which runs nearly e. and w. a mile in length, parallel with the water : this is crossed by a number of other streets, which run from the water, a number of which, particularly Calvert and Gay streets, are well built. 2V". and e. of the town the land rises, and presents a noble view of the town and bay. In 1790, this city owned 27 ships, 1 snow, 31 brigantines, 34 schooners, and 9 sloops, total 102; tonnage 13,564. The exports in the same year amounted to 2,027,770, and the imports to 1,949,899 dollars. The exports in July, August, and September, in 1790, amounted only to 343,584 dollars; but in these months in 1795, they amounts2

==[[Barbadoes|BARBADOES]]==, an island of the N. sea, one of the Lesser Antillas, situate to the n. of that of St. Vincent, and to the s. of Martinica ; is eight leagues long and five wide, and is of an oval shape. It was discovered by William Courteen in 1625, in the reign of James 1. king of England, who was returning from Pernambuco in Brazil,  and was driven hither by a tempest, when he went on shore to reconnoitre, and found the island was crowded with wpod ; indeed it was supposed that there was not a clear spot of ground upon it, and it seemed altogether desert, and uninhabited even by savages. There were neither pastures, grain, or herbs to be found upon it ; but as the climate was good, and the soil appeared to befer« tile, it was settled by some English of small fortunes, who, after infinite pains and difficulty, succeeded in clearing away some of the timber with which it was so covered : the first crops were of course but scanty, but this, however, did not cause these new colonists to give up their enterprise ; and they were afterwards kept in countenance and joined by some of their brethren who fled hither on account of the English civil wars. It was then granted by the king as a property to his favourite the Earl of Carlisle, and it thus so far increased in population, that in 20 years afterwards, namely in 1650, it contained 50,000 whites, and a greater number of Negro slaves. The king created 13 barons in this colony, who, in 1676, had upwards of 1000 Negroes, and employed more than 400 vessels, from 50 to 100 tons burthen, in their commerce of sugar, indigo, cotton, ginger, and other productions. *• The increase of the English colonies in the other islands caused the extraordinary elevation of fortune and dignity then prevalent in this, in some degree, to subside ; and what did not in a less degree contribute to its downfal, was the terrible plague which broke out here in 1692, and continued for some years. It is by nature very strong, and completely surrounded by rocks, so that it is thoroughly sheltered to the windward ; to the leeward it has many good bays, and the whole coast is defended by a line of small forts. The country has the most beautiful appearance, being a series of valleys and mountains, cultivated in all parts, and full of plantations of sugarcane, oranges, lemons, citrons, limes, guavas, papas, aloes, and many other kinds of delicious fruits, and interspersed with country villas and dwellings : one of the principal branches of its commerce is rum, which is esteemed of the finest quality ; it abounds in fish and birds, and has many great caves or caverns, some of which are large enough to contain 500 men, and are used as hiding places by the Negroes who run away from their masters. Its temperature is very hot, especially in the eight summer months, and the heat would indeed be intolerable, were it not for the n. e. breeze which springs up about sunrise, and lasts as long as this luminary is above the horizon.  BARBADOES.  It has only one river, called Tuig. X paters of which are covered by a fluid similar m^ oil, and which is used for lamps. The island is divided into 11 parishes, which contain 14 churches and chapels. The names of the parishes of this island are, to the n. St. Lucy's, St. Peter's, and St. Andrew's ; to the s. St. Michael's, Christ Church, and St. Philip's ; and in the centre, St. James's, St. Thomas's, St. Joseph's, St. George's, and St. John's, which are divided into five districts : and it contains four towns, called Bridge Town, the capital, St. James's, formerly called the Hole, Speight's Town, and Ostin's, or Charles Town. 
[Barbadoes, notwithstanding what Alcedo remarks, was probably first discovered by the Portuguese in their voyages from Brazil, and from them it received the name which it still retains. It is said not to have been noticed in any seachart before the year 1600. It is usually ranked amongst the windward division of the Charibbes, being a day or two's sail from Surinam. From its being the first discovered of any of these islands, it is called the Mother of the Sugar Colonies. It was found without occupants or claimants. The Charibbes, for reasons altogether unknown to us, had deserted it, and the Portuguese, satisfied witli the splendid regions they had acquired on the continent, seem to have considered it as of little valne. Having furnished it with a breed of swine for the benefit of such of their countrymen as might navigate the same track, they left the island in all other respects as they found it. Of the English, the first who are known to have landed in this island, were the crew of a ship called the Olive Blossom, bound from London to Surinam in 1605, and fitted out at the expence of Sir Olive Leigh. Some years after this, a ship of Sir William Courteen's, a merchant of London, returning from Brazil, was driven by stress of weather into this island, and finding refreshments on it, the master and seamen, on their arrival in England, made so favourable a report of the beauty and fertility of the country, that Lord Ley (afterwards Earl of Marlborough, and lord high treasurer) immediately obtained from King James I. a grant of the island to himself and his heirs in perpetuity. Accordingly William Dean, with SO settlers, under the instigation of Court cen, arrived here safe in the latter end of the year 1624, and laid the foundations of a town, which, in the honour of the sovereign, they denominated James Town ; and thus began the first English settlement in the island of Barbadoes. In 1627 it was made over by patent to the Earl of Carlisle, afterwards 'to William, Earl  of Pembroke, in trust for Courteen, and again restored by other letters to the Earl of Carlisle. Thf latter person, in order completely to ruin all the interests in the colony of his competitor, proceeded to distribute the lands to such persons as chose to receive grants at his hands on the terms proposed to them. A society of London merchants accepted 10,000 acres, on conditions which promised great advantage to the proprietor ; but they were allowed the liberty of sending out a person to preside over their concerns in the colony, and they made choice for this purpose of Charles Woolferstone, who repaired to the island, accompanied with 64 persons, each of whom was authorised to take up 100 acres of land. These people landed on the 5th of July 1628, at which time Courteen's settlement was in a very promising condition ; but Woolferstone declared it an encroachment and usurpation, and being supported by the arrival of Sir William Tufton, who was sent out as chief governor by Lord Carlisle, in 1629, with a force sufficient for the maintenance of his pretensions, he compelled the friends of Courteen to submit ; and the interests of the latter were thenceforth swallowed up and forgotten. Owing to a civil war in England/many people of peaceable tempers and dispositions, chiefly royalists, took refuge in this island ; and the consequent ruin of the king's affairs induced a still greater number, many of whom had been officers of rank in his service, to follow their example. The emigration from the mothercountry to this island was indeed so great during the commotions in England, that in 1650 it was computed there were 20,000 white men in Barbadoes, half of them able to bear arms, and furnishing even a regiment of horse to the number of 1000. "These adventurers,"" says Lord Clarendon,. "• planted themselves without any body's leave, and without being opposed or contradicted by any body." The colony, left to its own efforts, and enjoying an unlimited freedoom of trade, flourished beyond example. In the year 1646, however, the then Earl of Carlisle, who was son and heir of the patentee, stimulated by the renown of its wealth and prosperity, began to revive his claims as hereditary proprietor ; and entering into a treaty with Lord Willoughby of Parham, conveyed to that nobleman all his rights by lease for 21 years, on condition of receiving one half the profits in the mean time; but justly apprehending that the resident planters might dispute his pretensions, he very readily concurred with Lord Willoughby in soliciting a commission for the latter, as chief governor, under the sanction of regal authority. Soon after-]   
1 3d  

AHBADOE8.   ["wards the whole island became the possession of the crown, and many indeed were the disturbances that succeeded respecting the right of proprietorship, until the assembly passed an act, on the 12th September 1663, entitled, u An Act for settling the Impost on the Commodities of the Growth of this Island." 
The earliest planters of Barbadoes were sometimes reproached with the guilt of forcing or decoying into slavery the Indians of the -neighbouring continent. The history of Inkle and Yarico, which the Spectator has recorded for the detestation of mankind, took its rise in this island ; but happily this species of slavery was soon abolished. The Barbadoes tar (the oil alluded to by Alcedo) is a particular production of this island. It rises out of the earth, and swims on the surface of the water. It is of great use in the dry belly -ach, and in diseases of the breast. The form of the government of this island so very nearly resembles that of Jamaica, which may be found described under that article, that it is unnecessary to enter into detail, except to observe that the council is composed of 12 members, and the assemby of 22. The most important variation respects the court of chancery, which in Barbadoes is constituted of the governor and council, whereas in Jamaica the governor is sole chancellor. On the other hand, in Barbadoes the governor sits in council, even when the latter are acting in a legislative capacity. This, in Jamaica, would be considered improper and unconstitutional. It may also be observed, that the courts of grand sessions, common pleas, and exchequer, in Barbadoes, are distinct from each other, and not, as in Jamaica, united and blended in one supreme court of judicature. Here is a college founded by Colonel Codrington, the only institution of the kind in the W. Indies ; but it has not answered the intention of the founder. The houses of the planters are very thickly sown all along the country, which, with the luxuriant productions of the soil, and the gently swelling hills, form a delightful scene. That the dreadful succession of hurricanes, with which this and the other West Indian islands have been infested, has contributed to the great defalcatio!) of its revenues, cannot be doubted. The capital of this island was scarce risen from the ashes to which it had been reduced by two dreadful fires, when it was torn from its foundations, and the whole country made a scene of desolation, by the storm of the 10th of October 17S0, in which no less than 4326 of the inhabitants (b'acks and whites) miserably perished; smd the cUvnage to the country was computed at  j£li320,-5&amp;«-&gt; t5s. sterling. Moreover, the trade of this ^iiei some others of the islands, suffers considerably by a duty of4§ per cent, on exported produce ; out of which, however, the governor's salary, .€2000 ayear, is paid. The crown acquired this revenue in the reign of Charles II. which the planters agreed to, in order to secure possessions to which they had uncertain titles. 
Barbadoes is about 21 miles in length from Higll poiiit, its northern extremity, to South point; and 14 in breadth, from the Chair near Kitridge bay, e. to Valiant Royalist fort, w. ; and contains 106,470 acres of land, most of which is under cultivation. It lies 20 leagues e. from St. Vincent, which may be seen in a clear day, 25 from St. Lucia, 28 s. e. from Martinico, 60 n. c. from Trinidad, and 100 s.e. from St. Christopher's. The soil in the low lands is black, somewhat reddish in the shallow parts, on the hills of a chalky marl, and near the sea generally sandy. Of this variety of soil, the black mould is best suited for the cultivation of the cane, and, with the aid of manure, has given as great returns of sugar, in favourable seasons, as any in the West Indies, the prime lands of St. Kitt's excepted. We are assured, that about the year 1670, Barbadoes could boast of 50,000 white, and upwards of 100,000 black inhabitants, whose labours, it is said, gave employment to 60,000 tons of shipping. This account is supposed to be much exaggerated. It cannot however be doubted, that the inhabitants of this island have decreased with a rapidity seldom known in any other country. According to the most authentic returns of the number of whites in 1724, and of its Negroes in 1753, the former consisted of no more than 18,295, the latter of 69,870. In 1786 the numbers were 16,167 whites, 838 free people of colour, and 62,115 Negroes. It appears too that the annual produce of this island (particularly sugar) has decreased in a much greater proportion than in any other of the West Indian colonies. Postlethwayte states the crop of sugar, in 1736, at 22,769 hogsheads of 13 cwt. which is equal to 19,800 of 15 cwt. ; and the author of the European Settlements, published in 1761, calculates the average crop at 25,000 hogsheads. As the author first quoted gives a precise number, it is probable his statement was grounded on good authority. If so, the island has fallen off nearly one half in the annual growth of its principal staple. On an average of eight years (from 1740 to 1748) the exports were, 13,948 hogsheads of sugar, of 15 cwt. 12,884 puncheons of rum, of 100 gallons, 60 hogsheads of molasses, 4667 bags] 2  t*Mi  

BARBADOES.  [of ginger, 600 bags of cotton, and 327 gourds of aloes. The exports, on an average of 1784, 1785, and 1786, had fallen to 9554 hogsheads of sugar, 5448 puncheons of rum, 6320 bags of ginger, 8331 bags of cotton ; exclusive of some smaller articles, as aloes, sweetmeats, &amp;c. of which the quantities are not ascertained. The variation in the produce of sugar is from 6000 to 13,000  hogsheads ; whilst Grenada, St. Vincent's, Tobago, vary only as from 12,000 to hogsheads.  
By report of privy council, 1788, the British property vested here is estimated at 106,470 taxed acres of patented estates ; and the Negroes are computed at 60,000, at 50/. each Negro. The same report, in a general appraisement of British property vested in the British colonies, makes the land, buildings, and stock, double the value of the Negroes ; and the towns, stores, and ship-  and ing, about one twentysecond part of the lands

The above statements will, it is conceived, give a good general view of the commercial relations of Bardadoes from the earliest period ; and it will be found that its produce for the European market has been regularly on the decline, though somewhat uniform, since 1787 to the present year. Independently of all political circumstances, to which the cause might possibly be traced, we shall content ourselves in quoting the physical causes ascribed by Sir Charles Young. " As this decrease (he observes) " has been constant and progressive, it is to be apprehended that the cause is of certain and continued effect; namely, diminished and diminishing fertility, if not from exhausted soil, yet from the country being overcleared and deprived of woods, and therewith deprived of moisture, under their shade and covert, to form reservoirs fot rivulets ; and deprived too of the attraction to clouds and rain, which, in the tropical climates, are indispensable to fertility, and which the wooded]   BAR 
{hills of islands constantly afford, and are in example of." To the above causes of the decline of the exports, we would have our readers bear in mind the dreadful succession of hurricanes which took place in 1784. The state of the population of this island at different periods, will be seen by the following authentic documents.

It also yields cotton, pepper, tobacco, indigo, ginger, and sugarcane ; not to mention the. other fine productions of exquisite woods, herbs, and roots, with which it is plentifully stocked. The English, however, derive but little advantage from if, from the frequent attacks made against them by the Charibbee Indians ; and by these they are frequently put to death. Here grows the sensitive plant, which Avithers as soon as touched. It abounds in different kinds of snakes ; and amongst these there is a certain species which is of a yellow and red colour, and having a flat head, the bite of which produces certain death, if recourse be not had to immediate remedy.

==[[Barcelona|BARCELONA]]==, a province of the government of Cumana, one of the three which compose that government; bounded on the w. by Cumana, e. by Caracas, and s. by the river Orinoco, which also divides it from Guayana. All the front looking to the n. is a part of the serrania, which commences at the Punta de Paria, and runs as far as Santa Marta. At the distance of nine leagues to the back of this province, begin the extensive llanos, which bear its name, and which, uniting with those of Caracas, run 5. as far as the Orinoco ; but these llanos are nothing more than barren wastes, producing no herbs, though they are nevertheless well stocked with cattle, which breed here in great abundance, and which derive their food from the rank herbage which grows upon the banks of the rivers ; and when these suffer from drought, the fatality amongst these poor creatures is, of course, terrible. The temperature here is the same as that of Cumana, though not so unhealthy. This province produces nothing but maize, yucas, plantains, and such other fruits as are found in the abovementioned province, and even these in nogreat abundance. It is however noted for its cattle ; and the inhabitants have a method of salting down meats, which they call tasajo, and which they export to the islands of Margarita, Trinidad, and to other parts. With regard to the skins, a third part of them are sent to St. Domingo and Puertorico, and the rest are exported by the Dutch ; and it is calculated that not less than from 8 to 9000 head of cattle are killed here annually. Its coast abounds in fish, but they are neither so plentiful, nor of so fine a flavour, as upon the coast of Cumana. It has four small saltpits, of which the natives make free use, and this without any other trouble than that of merely extracting the salt. Its principal rivers are those of Barcelona and Unare, both of which run n. A species of palm is very common throughout the whole province ; it resembles the datetree, which is called here moriche, producing every year a rivulet of water, and many of them together a very tolerable stream, from a tendency which has been discovered in this plant to absorb the moisture from the earth. 1 his province contains 32 settlements, viz. three headtowns, the capital of its name, Aragua, and Conception de Pao, 15 consecrated villages, and 17 of missions or reducciones of Indians, which arens follows : Pozuelos, Clarines, San Miguel, Caigua,

The capital was founded in 1634 by Don Juan deUrpin, on a level upon the shores of the river of its name, at half a league's distance from the sea. Its soil is very uneven ; and as it is not payed, it becomes in the winter extremely rugged and inconvenient, through the rains, as also dusty and disagreeable in the summer, on account of the dust, which flies about in all directions, if the wind blow ever so mildly. It is an open town, without any fortification, small, and containing 500 housekeepers, who are masters of i 50 small estates, some of which are of cacao, situate in the valley of Cupira, in the^ province of Caracas, and from whence the productions are not allowed to be exported. The other estates are of the larger cattle, in which are counted upwards of 40,000 head, which would be sufficient completely to enrich any other country where they might not be rated at so low a price ; for H is common for one head to bring no more than two dollars and a half, if paid in real money, and four if in effects ; and this may be considered the cause why this place is so poor, notwithstanding that its natives are the most industrious of any in the province. It contains, besides the parish church, which is not yet finished, another, with a hospital for the religious Franciscans of the missions of Piritu. Twelve leagues from the capital, Cumana; but this distance, on account of the badness of the roads, and unevenness of the country, should be estimated at no less than 20. [Its population, according to Depons, is 14,000 souls, and it has only one parish church, and an hospital for the Franciscans, who bear the expence of the missions to th#se parts. The great number of hogs that are bred here cause in the city infectious sewers, which corrupt the air and engender diseases. The cabildo, whose principal office is to watch over the salubrity of the inhabi-  tants, leave them indifferently exposed to all the malignity of the infectious effluvia, the danger of which they themselves partake. However, toward$ the end of 1803, M. Cagigal, the commander of the place, took some wise measures to rid the city of an infection which could not but be fatal to persons staying there. This city was originally peopled by inhabitants from St. Christophe de Cumanagoto, for which it has been in some manner substituted. Agriculture is much neglected in Barcelona and the environs. The most cultivated valleys are those of Capirimal and Brigantin. There are others as fertile,which have never received the ploughshare. Depons asserts, that they do not yield above 3000 quintals of cacao, with some little cotton; and Humboldt admits, at an average of four years, from 1799 to 1803, the quantity of cacao exported from hence to have amounted to 5000 fanegas. This part of the country is almost without slaves; they compute but 2000 on a surface which would employ 600,000, and one half of the 2000 are occupied in domestic services. Besides the horned cattle that they sold for the use of the country, or for exportation inhabitants killed a prodigious quantity, which they salted and sold in the neighbouring islands, and at the Havannah, at a profit of cent, per cent. The tallow and hides were also a considerable article of traffic. At present this resource is greatly diminished, without being destroyed. The robbers, who, since 1807, commit with impunity their devastations on the herds, have reduced this province to such a scarcity in animals, that they have hardly enough for their butchers' shops. 
The population of Barcelona is composed of one half whites and the other people of colour. The latter are as useless in agriculture here as every where else. Among the whites there aresome Catalonians, who are entirely merchants, whose speculations are in prohibited as well as in lawful goods. By their frequent voyages to the ports of Trinidad, they bring in return only contraband goods, for which Barcelona is the emporium, and which afterwards are diffused throughout the provinces, as well by sea as by land. It is computed that 400,000 piastres fortes are annually exported from Barcelona fortius clandestine trade. The city lies in Lat. 10° 10'. Long. 64° 47' as.J

BAR1NAS, a city of the government of Maracaibo, founded in 1576 by Juan Varela, on the shore and at the source of the river of St. Domingo, is famous for the tobacco which it produces, and which is esteemed the very best ; is of an extremely hot temperature, but very fertile, and abounds in the above article and cacao, both of wh  ich are carried to Caracas, and sold at the rate of 20 dollars a carga. It abounds in neat cattle, and in some of its estates are upwards of SO or 40,000 head, and an equal number of horses and mules of an excellent quality ; also in sugarcane : and it has many mills for the manufactures of this article and brandy. There are quantities of maize, plantains, yucas, uyamas, potatoes, curas, and names, which latter is a species of root like truffles, grows spontaneously, and comes to such a size as to be.of a pound weight : it is, consequently, the custom to cut away parts of it for use, with-  out pulling up the whole root at once : of the yucas is made cazave, which is the common bread. In the level plains are found a remarkable number of pines, water melons, which are called palillas ; other melons, annonas, tuciiraguas, of a very fine smell, and which have the property of causing fevers ; and plaintains of many sorts. In the mountains are woods of cacao trees, Avhich grow without being sown, the nuts of which are small. There are also found groves of limes and oranges, extensive mountains of exquisite woods, some of delicious fragrance and aromatic gums, others of an excessive hardness and durability, such as cedars, granadilhs, red and black, here called caiiagitate^smd many herbs, fruits, and medicinal roots ; the espongilla fruit, which being infused in water,- is an excellent and certain purgative ; the pasalla root, and the zarzaparilla. This territory has many navigable rivers, and in them an abundance of excellent fish, trout, tortoises, morrocoyes, seacalves, and alligators. The parish church is good, but the city is reduced, owing to its inhabitants, who amount to about 300 housekeepers, having agreed, for the most part, to remove themselves to a spot at some distance, and to their having already in a great measure put their design into execution. In its jurisdiction, and in the jurisdiction of the town of Pedraza, are eight settlements of missions or reducciones of Indians, which are under the care of monks of St. Dominic. Notwithstanding all the advantages this city enjoys, it is much infested with swarms of mosquitoes of various sorts, spiders, snakes, lice, and various other sorts of noxious and filthy vermin. Its heat also is excessively troublesome. This city had formerly the name of Altamira de Caceres, from the governor Francisco de Caceres ; and at his order it was founded by Juan Varela, at the top of a sierra r which served it as a wall. It had only two entrances, the one leading out to the lldnos to the s. e. and the other to the n. w. which facilitated the communication with the cities of Merida and Truxillo. After some years, when the infidel Indiansretired from its territory, the inhabitants removedtbe settlement to the s. side of the river St. Domingo, upon a spacious tableland theretofore called Moromy, but afterwards Barinas, this being the name of that territory. There it remained until the year 1646, when some of the religious order of St. Dominic, having pacified the Indians who remained, established different estates, and founded various settlements, under the assistance of an escort of troops. Again the Captain Miguel de Ochagayia, native of this city, in 1634, having discovered the navigation of the rivers Apure and  l«  
■«■  wmm  Orinoco as far as Guayana and the island of Trinidad ; the inhabitants, as well to deliver themselves from the plagues of the venomous serpents, ants, mosquitoes, and other insects, agreed to betake themselves to a certain level plain, and actually departed in 1752, under the permission of Don Joseph de Solis, viceroy of Santa Fe. The city was then founded on a spacious plot of ground, of an healthy temperature, of a pure air and atmosphere, at the distance of a quarter of a league from the river of St; Domingo, which runs to the n. of the city, the king approving this translation in the letters patent of 1760. In the old city there was a house of entertainment belonging to the monks of St. Augustine, which was broken up in 1776, and two hermitages, called El Calvario and San Pedro, which were ruined by an earthquake in 1740. At the present day it has only, in addition to the parish church, one hermitage, with the dedicatory title of Santa Barbara ; being however authorised to build another, with the title of Nuestra Sefiora del Carmen. In the former year, 1785, the king thought it worthy to be erected into a province and government, independent of, and situate from, that of Maracaibo, subject to the intendancy and captainshipgeneral of Venezuela, and in its ecclesiastic concerns, to the bishopric" newly erected in Merida. Its district abounds in neat cattle, mules, and horses ; also in sugar, tobacco, cotton, and some cacao; and, for some little time past, there have been here some rich establishments of indigo, which, for its quality, is highly esteemed in all parts. Its missions have always been of the religious order of St. Dominic, of the province of Santa Fe. Sixteen leagues to the e. of Merida. [The chief officer at Barinas has but the title of political commander, although his functions in his district are the same, in civil, military, and religious matters, as those of other governors. His salary is also the same as theirs, 4000 piastres fortes. The increase, of late years, of this part of the province, open to invasion by the navigable rivers which flow into the Orinoco, was the reason of the establishment of this government ; and for its better defence, a militia was formed in 1803, and the city was furnished with a garrison consisting of a company of troops of the line newly raised, and composed of 77 men. The city of Barinas has been long known in the European markets for its tobacco, which, from prejudice, is considered superior to all other, but, in reality, it is inferior in every respect to that cultivated in other places, and particularly in Cumanacoa in the province of Cuinana. The prepossession in its favour is nevertheless so great, that at Amsterdam or Hamburgh,   tobacco of any other description, whatever may be its quality, sells for 20 or 25 per cent. less. The Spaniards being aware of this, all tobacco, from whatever province it may be produced, is shipped by them under this recommendatory title, and the European purchaser experiences no loss from the deception. It is observed of late, that the tobacco of Barinas is more subject to spoil than any other. Hardly is the last process of preparation finished when a destructive worm gets, into the heart of the plant, corrodes the interior of it, and converts it into a powder ; the surface appears but slightly injured, and the injury is therefore more difficult to discover. The inhabitants, for a long time intent solely on the cultivation of tobacco, conceived that the country was not capable of yielding any thingelse, but at present they grow, or endeavour to grow, every thing. The produce is transported in a great degree by water to the Guayana : the place of loading is on the Portuguese river, five leagues below the city, and is called Torunos. The air of the city is very pure, although Reaumur's thermometer is seldom below 24°. The inhabitants are computed at 10,000. Barinas lies 100 leagues s. s. e. of Caracas. Lat. 7° 35' n.

==[[Bariquisimeto|BARIQUISIMETO|Nueva Segovia]]==, a city of the province and government of Venezuela in the kingdom of Tierra Firme, founded in 1552 by Captain Juan de Villegas on the shores of the river Buria, with the name of Nueva Segovia, in the vicinity of the gold mines which are in the valley of Nirua, to the e. of Tucuyo ; but its bad climate and scarcity of every necessary induced the Governor Villacinda to remove it two leagues from Tucuyo ; from whence it was again removed by Pablo Collado to a spot lying between the livers Turbio and Claro ; and a third time, by the Governor Manzaneda, to where it still remains, on some lofty llanuras. These are very open, and abound in all the fruits peculiar to Castilie, in excellent wheat, which is gathered in the valley of Quibon. The soil of this valley is extremely hot, but pleasantly irrigated by a stream flowing from a chasm or cleft in the serrania, where the natives often betake themselves during the summer nights to repose, on account of its refreshing coolness. It has a very good parish church, in which there is a -very fine and miraculous image of our Saviour crucified, and to which singular respect is paid ; also a convent of Franciscan. monks. This city      BAR   is notorious, from being the place where Lope de Aguirre met with his death, and where he put a period to his cruelties ; for being the country of Don Fray Gasper dc Villaroel, the very learned Archbishop of Charcas in Peru.

Sandy Neck, on the n. shore, runs e. almost the length of the town, and forms the harbour, embosoming a large body of salt marsh. The harbour is about a mile wide and 4 long, in which the tide rises from eight to fourteen feet. It has a bar running off n. e. from the Neck several miles, which prevents the entrance of large ships, but small vessels may pass any part of it at high water ; and where it is commonly crossed, it seldom has less than six or seven feet at low water. There is another harbour on the s. called Lewis's bay ; its entrance is within Barnstable, and it extends almost two miles into Yarmouth* It is commodious and safe, and is completely landlocked, and has five feet water at a middling tide. A mile or two to the w. and near the entrance of Lewis's bay, lies Hyanis road ; it is formed principally by an island joined by a beach to Yarmouth, which together make the outside of the bay before mentioned.

BARQUIS1METO or Bariquisimeto. This city was (according to Depons) founded 15 years before the city of Caracas: it lies on a plain of such an elevation as to allow it the enjoyment of every refreshing breeze that blows ; and owing to this fortunate situation, the excessive heat experienced here becomes supportable. The thermometer of Reaumur rises to 28° or 29° whenever the rays of the sun do not meet, in the atmosphere, any thing to moderate their heat. The most prevalent wind is the n. e. The inhabitants find in the plains, the valleys, and on the hills forming the environs of the city, the means of exercising, according to their inclination, their industry and application. The excellent pasture in the plains renders the rearing of all sorts of animals for commerce easy, BAR  A great many people prefer this kind of speculation, and find it to their advantage ; they also cultivate the sugarcane and wheat. The valleys by their verdure, preserved to them by means of canals, produce abundantly the best cacao, and the hills have for some time past been planted with coffee, which, to be excellent, only requires a more careful preparation. To consider merely the vast quantity of fertile land in the neighbourhood of Barquisimeto, which can be watered and which remains uncultivated, one would be inclined to accuse the inhabitants of indolence : but in extending our views to the plantations of all sorts of produce, and to the animals spread over the plains ; in contemplating too the great difficulty in the carriage of merchandize to the seaports, the nearest and most frequented of which is at a distance of 50 leagues, one is rather inclined to think favourably of their industry. The city consists of 3300 persons, who live very comfortably; the houses are well built, the streets in parallel lines, and wide enough for the free circulation of air. The parochial church is handsome, and the duty is performed by two curates. A cabildo and a lieutenant of the governor perform the functions of the police, and of the administration of justice. It is 80 leagues ze.s.w. of Caracas, 150 leagues n.n. e. of Santa Fe, and 15 leagues n. e. of Tocuyo.] See Bariquisimeto.

[BEHRING'S Bay, on the n. w. coast of N. America, is separated from Admiralty bay on the n. by a point of land, and lies n. w. from Cross sound. See Admiralty Bay.] 
[Behrlng's Straits, separate Asia from America, are so called from the Russian navigator, Captain Behring, -who, with Tshirikow, sailed from Kamptschatka in Siberia, on the Asiatic coast, in quest of the new world, in a quarter where it had perhaps never been approached. They both discovered land within a few degrees of the n. w. coast of America. But the more recent discoveries of Captain Cook, and his successor, Clarke, have confirmed the near approximation of the two continents. Cape Prince of Wales is the most westerly point of the American continent hitherto known. It is situated in lat. 65° 46' n. long. 168° 15' e. and is 39 miles distant from the e. coast of Asia. The sea, from the s. of Behring's straits, to the crescent of isles between Asia and America, is very shallow. It deepens from these straits (as the British seas do from Dover) till soundings are lost in the Pacific ocean, but that does not take place but to the s. of the isles. Between them and the straits is an increase from 12 to 54 fathoms, except only off St. Thaddeus Noss, where there is a channel of greater depth. From the volcanic disposition, it has been judged probable, not only that there was a separation of the continents at these straits, but that the whole space from the isles to that small opening had once been dry land ; and that the fury of the watery element, actuated by that of fire, had, in very remote times, subverted and overwhelmed the tract, and left the islands to serve as monumental fragments. The famous Japanese map places some islands seemingly within these straits, on which is bestowed the title of Ya Zue, or the Kingdom of the Dwarfs. This gives some reason to suppose that America was not unknown to the Japanese; and that they had, as is mentioned by Kaempfer and Charlevoix, made voyages of discovery ; and, according to the last, actually wintered upon the continent, where probably meeting with the Esquimaux, they might, in comparison of tbe.nselves, and justly, distinguish them by the name of dwarfs, j

Bermudas, islands of N. America, in the N. sea; thus called from having been discovered by Juan Bermudez in 1522. They are more than 400 in number, and for the most part desert and uninhabited. The largest is S. George, which is five leagues long and one broad ; and it is on account of its comparative consequence that this alone is treated of. The English who inhabit it call it also Sommers, on account of Sir George Sommers having been shipwrecked upon it soon after its discovery. It has different ports, and two castles, called Dowre and Warwick ; but so surrounded are they by rocks, and so defended bv nature, that it is with difficulty that a vessel of 10 tons burthen can enter the roads, or at least without considerable caution and assistance. The  

==[[Bermudas|BERMUDAS]]==,  'temperature is so good, that it is spring nearly the whole year round, the fields and trees being clad in eternal green,; but the tempests of thunder and lightning, together with the hurricanes, are at times tremendous. They are, however, anticipated 'by the inhabitants, who can tell their approach by watching the circle of the moon. These islands are so fertile that it is usual to gather in two crops or harvests in each year. They produce much amber, pearls, cochineal, and abundance of turtles, the fieSh of which is a great delicacy among the Emglish. This island abounds in swine, and in birds of different species : among these is that which, among naturalists, is called the crane, being a marine bird, and building its nest in the holes of the earth. The climate is so liealthy, that scarcely any one is observed to die except through old age. In these islands are found no species whatever of venomous animals ; and they abound with a sort of cedar, of which are ■built brigs and other small craft, which are much prized in America ; and this wood forms one part of its commerce. The English established themselves here in 1612, and formed a colony, which was enlarged by Captain Turquer'in 1116, he being the fir3t who planted in it tobacco and wheat. From this time the prosperity of it increased daily ; and shortly after, a fresh supply of 500 men arrived under the direction of Captain Butler, who divided the island into counties and parishes. Its population, however, was at the highest during the civil wars of England, when a large portion of the English nobility betook themselves to America, and among the rest, the poet Waller to this island, who afterwards wrote a description of it in a beautiful English poem. Its inhabitants may amount to about 5000. Formerly it carried on a great traffic in the article of hats made of palmtrees, and which were much esteemed by the ladies in all parts ; but this has greatly fallen to decay. [They lie in the form of a shepherd's crook, and are distant from the Land's End in England 1500 leagues, from the Madeiras 1200, from Hispaniola 400, and 200 from cape Hatteras in Carolina, which last is the nearest land to them. The islands are walled with rocks ; and by reason of these, together with shoals, are difficult to approach. The entrances into the harbours and channels are narrow as well as shoalty, ■and are more dangerous by reason of the strong current which sets to the n. e. from the gulf of Florida. The Bermudians are chiefly seafaring men, and the Negroes are very expert mariners. In the late war there were at one time between 15 yojo. i.   and 20 privateers fitted out from hence, which were manned by Negro slaves, who behaved irreproachably ; and such is the state of slavery here, and so much are they attached to their masters, that such as were captured always returned when it was in their power; a singular instance of which, occurred in the state of Massachusetts. The ship Regulator, a privateer, was carried into Boston, and had 70 slaves on board : 60 of them returned in a flag of truce, 9 returned by way of New York, one only was missing, who died. The government is conducted under a governor, named by the British crown, a council, and a general assembly. There are nine churches, of which three clergymen have the charge ; and there is one Presbyterian church. These islands contain from 12 to 13,000 acres of poor land, of which nine parts in ten are either uncultivated, or reserved ia woods, which consist chiefly of cedar, for the supply of shipbuilding. There are about acres laid out in cotton. The main island is about 16 miles long, and from one to two in breadth. The parish of St. George is an island to the e. of the main land, in which stands the town of St. George's, containing about 500 houses. Contiguous to that is St. David's island, which supplies the town with provisions. The air is healthy, and a continual spring prevails ; and most of the productions of the West Indies might be cultivated here. The houses are built of a soft stone, which is sawn like timber, but being washed with lime, it becomes hard ; these stones axe greatly in request throughout the West Indies for filtrating water. The houses are white as snow, which, beheld from an eminence, contrasted with the greenness of the cedars and pasture ground, and the multitude of islands full in view, realize what the poets have feigned of the Elysian fields. In the present war the Bermudas have been the usual winter station of the British naval force in the American seas ; and even ships of 74 guns have lately been carried into and out of the harbour, notwithstanding the extreme narrowness of the entrance. The climate is delightful in winter, but very hot in summer. Some accounts say that these islands contain from 15 to 20,000 inhabitants ; but Mr. Edwards says the number of whitepeople is 5462, of blacks 4919. Old writers observe that there were 3000 English in these islands in 1623. — Three or four hundred go annually to Turk's island to rake salt, which is carried to America for provisions, or sold to such as may call for it there for cash.

The large bones found here, and in several other places near Salt licks, and in low soft grounds, thought to belong to the mammoth, still puzzle the most learned naturalists to determine to what animal they have belonged. A thighbone found here by Gen. Parsons measured 49 inches A tooth of this animal is deposited in Bones of a similar kind have been found in other parts of America. A skeleton, nearly complete, and above 11 feet high, which was found near Hudson's river, was brought to England some years ago ; and another of nearly the same size is preserved in the college of New Jersey. Of this animal the natives have no tradition, but what is so fabulous that no conjecture can be aided by it, except that the animal was carnivorous ; and this is the general opinion, and was admitted by the late Dr. Hunter of London, from an examination of the tusks, &amp;c]

==[[Boston|BOSTON]]==, a large and opulent city, the metropolis of New England, and of the county of Suffolk, in N. America. In the year 1774, its port was prohibited by an act of parliament of Great Britain, and it was shortly after entered by the king's troops, who destroyed many edifices, and caused considerable havoc. It was at that time the largest and most considerable city of any of New England, having been founded in 1630, by the English colonists who came to it from Charlestown, in a peninsula of nearly four miles in circumference, and 44 from the bay of Massachusetts. It suffered much from an earthquake which took place on the 29th October 1727. It is the best situated for commerce of any city in America ; on the n. side of it are two small islands called Brewster, to one of which is also given the name of Noddle. The only entrance to the bay is through a channel so narrow, from the number of islands, as scarcely to admit three ships abreast. There are, however, marks and buoys placed so as to ensure a safe entrance, and the bay itself is capable of containing 500 vessels, in a sufficient depth of water, where they might formerly lie defended by the cannon of a regular fortress, but this was destroyed in the said war. At the extremity of the bay is a quay 2000 feet in length, which on the n. part has a set of regular magazines, beginning from the principal street in the city : this street, as well as all the others, is spacious and straight. The town from the bay has a beautiful appearance ; it is in the form of an amphitheatre, with a house for the magistrate, in which are the tribunals, and a change, which is a very fine piece of architecture, surrounded by many libraries, well provided, and giving work for five printing houses. It contains 19 churches, nearly 6000 houses, and 30,000 inhabitants. To form some judgment of the riches of this capital, it is sufficient to know, that from Christmas in the year 1747 to the following, 1748, no less than 500 vessels left its port, and that 430 entered it, not to mention the fishing vessels and coasters, the number of which alone amounted to at least 1000. It suffered much in 1773 by a terrible tempest. The commerce of this city is very great, not only on account of its own productions, but with regard to the productions of other parts, since its inhabitants are, as it were, the factors of all the other colonies of N. America, the E. Indies, and of some parts of Europe. Its principal articles or effects are trees and shipmasts, fish, tar, turpentine, planks, salted meats, as well pork aa beef, butter, cheese, horses, large cattle, wheat, cider, honey, and flax ; and although it trades also in skins, yet these form no considerable part of its commerce. On its coast are large whalefisheries, in which a great number of its inhabitants are employed; and it is computed that 30,000 quintals o£ oi\ are annually sent to Italy, Spain, England, and the islands of America, as also 20,000 more to the Negroes of the W. Indies. The excessive quantity of liquors distilled in Boston from molasses, received in exchange or barter from the W. Indies, is such as to cause them to be sold for two shillings a barrel, and with them are supplied all the colonies of N. America. They are also sufficient for the traffic with the Indians, for that of the fisheries of Newfoundland, and for a great part of the trade to Africa. The rum is as much renowned for its plentifulness and cheapness as for its quality. This may be looked upon as almost the only colony that has manufactures equal to its consumption. The cloths made here are strong and close wove : these manufactories were established by some Irish Presbyterians, who fled from persecution, and through affinity of religion, settled here, introducing the manufacture of linens of a very delicate texture ; thus having highly increased the commercial credit and reputation of the colony. They likewise make excellent hats here, and these, although contraband, are a great article of exportation to the other colonies. The vessels built here, through the commission of its dock, and which are afterwards sold with their cargo in the ports of Spain, France, and Portugal, formed the principal source of its commerce. There used to be a lighthouse on a rock for the direction of vessels in the night, the which was destroyed with the fortifications in the late war. This war originated in this capital in 1774, when the inhabitants burnt the tea which A A   178,  

BOSTON.   came from England, being unwilling to pay the heavy duties imposed on that article. The result of the struggle was, that they declared themselves independent of the English crown, together with the other colonies, as may be seen in the article United States. All sects are tolerated in this city, and in it are ten churches.. 
.[Boston, the capital of the state of Massachusetts, the largest town in New England, is now the third in size and rank in the United States, and lies in lat. 42° 18' 15" n. and long. 70° 59' 53" w.- This town, with the towns of Hingham, Chelsea,, and Hull, constitute the county of Suffolk, 176 miles s. w. of Wiscasset, 61 5. by w. of Portsmouth, 164 n. e. of New Haven, 252 n. e. of New York, 347 n. e. of Philadelphia, and 500 n, e. of the city of Washington.

Common street, and a few others, are exceptions to this, general character- ; the former is very spacious, and being on a line with Long wharf, where strangers usually land, exhibits a flattering idea of the town. Here are 19 edifices for public worship,, of which nine are for Congregationalists, three for Episcopalians,, and two for Baptists; the Friends, Roman Catholics, Methodists, Sandemanians, and Universalists,. have one each. Most of these are ornamented with beautiful spires, with clocks and bells.

Franklin place, adjoining Federal street theatre, is a great ornament to the town ; it contains a monument of Dr. Franklin, from whom it takes its name, and is encompased on two sides with buildings, which, in point of elegance, are not exceeded perhaps in the United States,. Here are kept in capacious rooms, given and fitted up for the purpose, the Boston library,, and the valuable collections of the historical society. Most of the public buildings are handsome, and some of them are elegant. A magnificent, statebouse is now erecting in Boston,  on the s. side of Beacon hill, fronting the Mall,, the cornerstone of which was laid with great formality and parade on the 4th of July 1795 j and which overtops the monument on Beacon hill.. The marketplace, in which the faneuilhall is situated, is supplied with all kinds of provisions which* the country affords. The fish market, in particular, by the bounteous supplies of the ocean and' rivers, not only furnishes the rich' with the rarest productions, but often provides the poor with a cheap and grateful repast. Boston harbour is formed by point Alderton on the s. and by Nahant point on then. It is variegated with about forty islands, of Avhich fifteen only can be properly called so ; the others being small rocks or banks of sand, slightly covered with verdure. These islands afford excellent pasturage, hay, and grain, and furnish agreeable places of resort in summer to parties of pleasure. Castle island is about three miles from the town ; its fortifications, formerly called Castle William, defend the entrance of the harbour. It is garrisoned by about 50 soldiers, who serve as a guard for the convicts, who are' sent here to hard labour. The convicts are chiefly employed in making nails. The lighthouse standson a small island on the w. entrance of the channel, (point Alderton. and Nantasket heights being on the s.), and is about 65 feet high. To steer for it from cape Cod, the course is w. n. w.. when within one league of the cape ; from cape^ Cod to the lighthouse is about 16 leagues ; from/ cape Ann the course is s. w. distant ten leagues.- A cannon is lodged and mounted at the lighthouse to answer signals. Only seven of the islands in the bay are within the jurisdiction of the town, and taxed with it, viz. Noddle's, Hog, Long,. Deer, Spectacle,. Governor's, and Apple islands. The wharfs and quays in Boston are about 80 in. number, and very convenient for vessels.. Long wharf, or Boston pier, in particular, extends from the bottom of State street 1743 feet into the harbour in a straight line.. The breadth is 104' feet. At the end are 17 feet of water at ebb tide. Adjoining to this wharf on the «. is a convenient wharf called Minot's T,. from the name of its former proprietor and its form. Vessels are supplied here witli fresh water from a well surrounded by salt water, which' has been dug at a great expence. Long wharf in every respect exceeds any thing of the kind in the United States. In February 1796, a company was incorporated to cut a canal between this harbour and Roxbury, which is neaily completed. Charles river and West Boston bridges are highly useful and ornamental to Boston; and both are on Charles river.}  [which mingles its waters with those of Mystic -riyer, in Boston harbour. Charles river bridge connects Boston with Charlestown in Middlesex county, and is 1503 feet long, 42 feet broad, stands on 75 piers, and cost the subscribers 50,000 .dollars. It was opened June 19, 1787.

This beautiful bridge exceeds the other as much in elegance as in length, and cost the subscribers 76,700 dollars. Both bridges have draws for the admission of vessels, and lamps for the benefit of evening passengers. Seven free schools are supported here at the public ex pence, in which the children of every class of citizens may freely associate together. The number of scholars is computed at about 900, of which 160 are taught Latin, •&amp;c. There are besides these many private schools. The principal societies in the commonwealth hold .their meetings in this town, and are, the marine society, American academy of arts and sciences, Massachusetts agricultural society, Massachusetts charitable society, Boston Episcopal charitable society, Massachusetts historical society, society for propagating the gospel, Massachusetts congregational society, medical society, humane society, 'Boston library society, Boston mechanic association, society for the aid of emigrants, charitable fire society, and seven respectable lodges of free and accepted masons. The foreign and domestic trade of Boston is very considerable, to support which there are three banks, viz. the branch of the United States bank, the Union, and the Massachusetts bank ; the latter consists of 800 shares of 500 dollars, equal to 400,000; the capital of the Union bank is 1,200,000 dollars, 400,000 of which are the property of the state. In 1784 the entries of foreign and coasting vessels were 372, and the clearances 450. In 1794 the entries from foreign ports were 567. In 1795 these entries amounted to 725, of which the ships were 96, barques 3, snows 9, polacre 1, brigs 185, dogger I, schooners 362, shallop 1, and sloops 65. To the principal manufactures, above enumerated, we may add Joafsugar, beer, sailcloth, cordage, wool, and cotton cards, playing cards, pot and pearl ashes, paper hangings, plate, glass, tobacco, and chocolate. There are SO distilleries, two breweries, ■eight sugarhouses, and eleven ropewalks..  .  Eight years ago, the intercourse with the country barely required two stages and twelve horses, on the great road between this and New Haven, distant 164 miles ; whereas there are now 20 carriages and 100 horses employed. The number of the different stages that run through the week from this town is upwards of 20 ; about 10 years ago there were only three. Attempts have been made to change the government -of the town from its present form to that of a city, but this measure, not according with the democratic spirit of the people, has as yet failed. At an annual meeting in March, nine select men are chosen for the government of the town ; at the same time are chosen a townclerk, a treasurer, 12 overseers of the poor, 24 fire wards, 12 clerks of the market, 12 scavengers, 12 constables, besides a number of other officers, if the inhabitants do not reap all the advantages they have a right to expect from their numerous officers, it is said that it is not for want of wholesome laws for the regulation of the weights, measures, and quality of provisions, or other branches of police, but because the laws are not put in execution. Besides those called trained bands, there are four other military companies in Boston, viz. the ancient and honourable artillery company, the cadets, fusileers, and artillery. The ancient and honourable artillery company was incorporated in 1658, and the election of a captain and officers of it for the year is on the first Monday in June annually, which is observed here as a day of festivity. Several officers in the American army, who signalized themselves in the late war, received their first knowledge of tactics in this military school. Boston was called Shaumut by the Indians ; Trimountain by the settlers in Charlestown, from the view of its three hills ; and had its present name in token of respect io the Rev. Mr. Cotton, a minister of Boston ia England, and afterwards minister of the first church here. Boston has suffered severely by numerous fires, the houses being mostly built of wood. The last large fire happened July 30, 1794, and consumed 96 houses, ropewalks, &amp;c. and the account of losses given in by the sufferers amounted to 209,861 dollars. Boston feels a pride in having given birth to Benjamin Franklin, and a number of other patriots, who were among the most active and influential characters in effecting the revolution.]

==[[Bravo|BRAVO]]==, a large and abundant river of the kingdom of Nueva Espaila, which rises in 40° 20' n. lat. and runs s. till it enters the sea in the bay of Mexico, in 25° 55'. [Under the 40° of latitude, the sources of the Rio del Norte, or Rio Bravo, are only separated from the sources of the Rio Colorado by a mountainous tract of from 12 to 13 leagues of breadth. This tract is the continuation of the cordillera of the Cranes, which stretches towards the sierra Verde and the lake of Timpanogos, celebrated in -the Mexican history. The Rio S. Rafael and the Rio S. Xavier are the principal sources of the river Zaguananas, which, with the Rio de Nabajoa, forms the Rio Colorado : the latter has its embouchure in the gulf of California. These regions, abounding in rocksalt, were examined in 1777 by two travellers full of zeal and intrepidity, monks of the order of St. Francis, Father Escalante and Father Antonio Velez. But however interesting the Rio Zaguananas and the Rio del Norte may one day become for the internal commerce of this n. part of New Spain, and however easy the carriage may be across the mountains, no communication will ever, it is thought, result from it, comparable to that opened directly from sea to sea.

==[[Brazil|BRAZIL]]==,  a kingdom of S. America,, situate in  the torrid zone r extending from the mouth of the large river Maranon, or Amazonas, to that of La Plata, from 2° n. to 35° s. of the equinoctial line. It is of a triangular figure, two of its sides, the n. and e. being bounded by the sea. and the third, which is the greater, is the line of demarcation between this kingdom, which belongs to the crown of Portugal, and the dominions of the king of Spain. This country was discovered by Vincenfe Yanez Pinzoniu 1498; afterwardsby Diego LopeztQl500;  by Americo Vespucio in 1501 ; and by Pedro Alvarez Cabral in 1502, who was by chance sailing for the E. Indies. He gave it the name of Santa Cruz, in memory of the day on which it was discovered ; this, however, it did not retain, and it has been called continually Brazil, from the abundance of fine wood of this name found in it. On the death of the king Don Sebastian, this kingdom, as forming a part of the dominion of Portugal, came to Philip III. by inheritance, as belonging to the crown of Castirle. The Dutch, under the command of the prince of Nassau, made themselves masters of the greater part of it ; but this loss was again recovered by the Spanish and Portuguese, after a bloody war of many years duration, when it was restored to the dominion of the latter by a treaty of general peace. It is divided into 14 provinces or captainships, which are, Rio Janeiro, Todos Santos, Ilheos, Parayba, Para, Maranan, Espiritu Santo, ltamaraca 1,Seara, Puerto Seguro, Pernambuco, Sergipe del Rey, San Vincente, and Rio Grande ; and in these are 12 cities, 67 towns, and an infinite number of small settlements and villages, divided into four bishoprics, suffragan to an archbishop ; and besides these there is the district of San Pablo de los Mamelucos, which is governed after the manner of a republic, with some subordination to the crown of Portugal. Also there are the districts of Dele and Petaguey,. which being in the centre of the captainship of Seara, belong to the barbarians, and to some Portuguese who are independent of the jurisdiction of liey. The French, in 1584, established themselves in Parayba, the Rio Grande, and Canabata, from whence they were driven out by the Portuguese in 1600. In 1612, however, they returned to construct a fortress in the island of Maranon, with the name of San Luis, which was taken by the Dutch, and afterwards by the Portuguese in 1646. From that time this kingdom has belonged to the crown of Portugal, and has given title to the heir apparent, who is called Prince of Brazil. It has many fine rivers, und many large, safe, and convenient ports ; but these are difficult to be entered, on account of the rocks and quicksands which abound on the coast. The  interior of this kingdom i  woods,. mountains,, and lakes; inhabited by wan dering nations, for the most part savage, and who kept up a continual warfare with the Portuguese ; some, however, have been civilized by the missionsthat have been established among them by the venerable Father Joseph de Ancheta, of the company of Jesuits, who has been called the Tauma*- iurgo r_the word alluding to a saint of the fourth!   uncultivated, full of  BRAZIL.  century, called Gregory Thaumaturgus, from the miracles lie is said to perform] of Brazil, and by Father Antonio de Vieira, a celebrated orator. These savage Indians feast upon the bodies of those whom they take in battle, fancying that they thereby revenge the deaths of their parents or relations who may have fallen under the hands of the enemy. They enjoy a long life, not only from the salubrity of the climate, but from the temperance which is usual amongst them. They are polygamists, and all of them, men as well as women, go naked. They believe in the creation of the world and the deluge ; and they think that there is a paradise beyond their mountains, where they live for ever in sensual enjoyments, such as singing, dancing, &amp;c. They have a very great terror of the devil, who, they affirm, appears to them in an horrible shape, and whom they call in their language agnian. They have neither king nor prince, and in their affairs of state the decision always rests with the elders, who are universally reverenced and esteemed amongst them. Their weapons are bows and arrows, and cimeters, or, as they call them, macanas. When they move from one quarter to another, the wife carries the arms, and the children the haramoc, which is a net made of the bark of plants, which, being tied to two trees at its extremities, serves them for house and bed in their travels. They maintain themselves by the chase and by fishing. The greater part of them are of a fierce aspect, which they increase by adorning themselves with the teeth and bones of monkeys, and with black and red paint, which they smear over their faces and bodies. They are of a lofty stature, robust, well made, and of an extraordinary agility in running. The temperature of this country is very unequal ; for towards the n. it is very warm and unhealthy. The soil is extremely fertile, and when cultivated yields every thing for the convenience and luxury of life. After the fine gold and diamond mines with which this country abounds were discovered, the natives gave themselves up entirely to the working of them, despising the culture of the land, and looking for the necessary supplies of food from other parts. Its principal productions maybe reduced to sugar, maize, cotton, tobacco, indigo, ipecacuana, balsam of copaive, and Brazilwood ; of this last consists the principal branch of its commerce, as well with the English as the Dutch, and to the coast of Africa as well as Europe. From the latter three fleets set out annually, one for Pemambuco, another for Rio Janeiro, and a third for the bay of Todos Santos ; from whence, upon their return, they join and make for Portugal, loaded with immense  treasures. [These fleets have ceased to make their voyages.] After the expulsion of the Dutch, this country was, as it were, for a time disregarded b&gt;- its possessors ; for they had not as yet ascertained or discovered its rich mines ; at least not before the year 1685. The minister of Portugal was well aware of the utility that would be derived to his country by the territories of this kingdom being well allotted and cultivated, and that by establishing the capital in the bay of Todos Santos, it would be extremely convenient and centrical for the purposes of commerce ; but the rigour and cruelty with which the first founders treated the poor Indians, were a sufficient obstacle against his bringing about his laudable designs. The Mus~ tees, who are the descendants of the Spaniards and the natives, having kept on good terms with both parties, were the means by which all things were brought to a mutual reconciliation. The government was then vested in some priests of acknowledged virtue : these immediatley scattered themselves over the whole coast,founding settlements, and penetrating into the interior; they first discovered the different gold mines, which have been since worked &lt;o such prodigious emolument ; as also the mines of diamonds, topazes, and other precious stones. This kingdom abounds in birds, exquisite not less for the beauty of their plumage than for the sweetness of their note ; in many kinds of rare animals, in vipers and venomous insects, and in an incredible number of tigers and monkeys of all sorts. It abounds also in every kind of pulse and fruit ; and amongst these, the pine is most exquisite. This kingdom is governed by a viceroy appointed by the king of Portugal, and who is always one of the head of the nobility of that kingdom ; his residence being in the city of St. Salvador, which is the capital. [The trade of Brazil is very great, and increases every year. They import as many as 40,000 Negroes annually. The exports of Brazil are diamonds, gold, sugar, tobacco, hides, drugs, and medicines ; and they receive in return woollen goods of all kinds, linens, laces, silks, hats, lead, tin, pewter, copper, iron, beef, and cheese. They also receive from Madeira a great quantity of wine, vinegar, and brandy ; and from the Azores 25,000/. worth of other liquors. The gold and diamond mines are but a recent discovery ; they were first opened in 1681, and have since yielded above five millions sterling annually, of which a fifth part belongs to the crown. These, with the sugar plantations, occupy so many hands, that agriculture lies neglected, and Brazil depends upon Europe for its daily bread ; although before the discovery of]   I L.  these mines, the soil was found very sufficient for subsisting the inhabitants. The diamonds here are neither so hard nor so clear as those of the East Indies, neither do they sparkle so much, but they are whiter ; the Brazilian diamonds are sold 10 per cent, cheaper than the oriental ones, supposing the weights to be equal. The crown revenue arising from this colony amounts annually to two millions sterling in gold, if some late writers are to be credited, besides the duties and customs on merchandize imported from that quarter. This indeed is more than a fifth of the precious metal produced by the mines ; but, every other consequent advantage considered, it probably does not much exceed the truth The Portuguese here live in the most effeminate luxury. When people appear abroad, they are carried in a kind of cotton hammocs, called serpentines, which are borne on Negroes' shoulders, similar to palanquins in India. The portrait drawn of the manners, customs, and morals of that nation in America, by judicious travellers, is very far from being favourable.

2. Don Ft. Juan De la Madre de Dios, of the order of St. Francis ; a provincial in that order, preacher to the king, and examiner of the military orders ; noted as being one of the most pleasing and eloquent orators of his time : he took possession of the archbishopric in 1683, and governed only three years, since he died in a plague which then prevailed, in 1686. 
3. Don Fr. Manuel de la Resurreccion, collegian of San Pedro, doctor in canons and laws, canon of the holy church of Lamego, and deputy of the holy office of the inquisition : disengaging himself from the world, he quitted these dignities, and entered the convent of Varatojo, where the fame of his virtues caused him to be elected archbishop of La Bahia. He entered his office in 1688, and died in 1691. 
^ 4. Don Juan Franco de Oliveira, promoted to the archbishopric of Angola : he was adorned with this metropolitan mitre for eight years, from 1692 to 1700, when he returned to Portugal to take that of the diocese of Miranda. 
5. Don Sebastian Monteiro de Vide, who had belonged to the company of Jesuits, but who, being expelled from the same, gave himself up to a military life, and became captain of infantry : being disgusted with this, he applied himself to study in the university of Coimbra, and again embraced an ecclesiastical state. In this he held different commissions, and he was at last prior of Santa Marina, and vicargeneral of the archbishopric of Lisbon, from whence he was elected to be the archbishop of La Bahia in 1702, where he governed with great address for the space of 20 years, notwithstanding the afflicting and severe disorder which confined him nearly the whole of this time to his chamber, and of which he died in 1722.

1. Tome de Sousa, a subject of Portugal, of noble birth, who had served with great renown in the expeditions of Africa and Asia : he was elected by the king, Don Juan III. to establish the govern-  ment in Brazil, in 1549 ; and this he effected with great skill, until, in 1553, he was recalled to Lisbon, and promoted to the office of master of the horse to the royal family. 
2. Don Duarte de Costa, chief armourer of the king : he entered his office in 1553, and governed until 1558, when he was succeeded by, 
3. Mendo de Sa, an illustrious branch of the house of the Marquises of Abrantes : he was elected on account of his singular attainments, learning, and military prowess ; though even these were exceeded by the happy establishments, the foundations of settlements, and the brilliance of conquests to which he was accessary in Brazil during the 14 years of his reign ; he died in 1572, at Bahia, universally regretted. 
4. Don Luis de Vasconcelos : he died at sea, and before he could reach his destined situation, owing to the misfortunes and long voyage of the illomened fleet in which he had embarked. 
5. Luis Brito de Almeida, in whose time the mines of diamonds and topazes were first discovered and dug : he governed five years, until 1578, when he was succeeded by, 
6. Lorenzo de Vega, who, being at a very advanced age, governed for three years only, and died in 1681. A vacancy for two years then ensued, and the government was administered by the council of Camara, and the eldest of the oidores, Don Cosme Rangel de Macedo, until the right governor came, who was, 
7. Manuel Tellez Barreto, nominated by Philip II. king of Spain, who, in 1583, inherited the crown of Portugal. Although he was also much advanced in years, the government suffered nothing on this account during the four years of his power ; he died in 1587. In the vacancy, the government was held by the bishop, Don Antonio Barreiros, and the purveyorgeneral of the royal revenues, Christobal de Barros, who exercised it for four years, until the year 1591. 
8. Francisco Giraldes, senor proprietor of the captainship ofLosIlheos, which title had been purchased by his father of Geronimo Figueredo : he was nominated governor, and having embarked at Lisbon, was driven back twice by distress, when, auguring badly from this misfortune, he gave up his appointment, and in his stead was nominated, 
9. Don Francisco de Sousa, who entered La Bahia in 1594 : he was first marquis of the mines, by favour of the king, who promised him this title, should he recover those mines which, according to some, had been already discovered by Roberio Diaz ; he was renowned for his skill and his good

BRAZIL.  dispositions, and was removed from the government, after having held it for 11 years, till 1602. 
10. Diego Botelho, the first governor that was nominated by Philip III. : he governed five years, from 1602 to 1607. 
1 1. Don Diego de Meneses, who arrived at La Bahia in 1608, and governed till 1613, when he was succeeded by, 
12. Gaspar de Sousa, who entered the government in the above year, rendering it famous by the expulsion of the French, who had established themselves in the island of San Luis de Marafian : he visited all the provinces of the kingdom, from whence arose great advantages to the different settlements, as likewise an increase of the revenues during the short period of his stay, which was four years, till 1617. 
13. Don Luis de Sousa, who entered in the above year to succeed the former ; and who, having remained in the government for four other years, namely to 1621, resigned it in favour of, 
14. Diego de Mendoza Hurtado, who entered in the year 1622, at which period the Dutch had invaded Brazil : La Bahia was then besieged by them, and he was made prisoner, after having valiantly defended himself with only 18 men ; he was carried in triumph to Holland in 1624. 
15. Matias de Albuquerque, who was governing at Pernambuco when he was called to be nominated to his government, which, in the interim, was administered by the fathers of the company of Jesuits ; but as he was at least 150 leagues off, and as the country was beset with enemies, it was thought expedient to promote, by way of an interregnum, the auditorgeneral, Anton Mezquita de Oliveira, who, owing to his age and want of military science, so necessary under such circumstances, ceded the government to the Colonels Don Lorenzo Cavalcanti de Alburquerque, and Don Juan de B;irros Cardoso, who also ceded it to the bishop, Don Marcos Texeira, and he delivered the weighty concern to Francisco Nunez Marinho de Eza, sent out as the right governor from Pernambuco ; but before this person could arrive, there was nominated as successor, 
16. Don Francisco de Moura Rolim, native of Pernambuco, who had followed a military career with great credit in Italy and Flanders, and who gained no less applause during his government here, and in the period of the war till 1626. 
17. Don Diego Luis de Oliveira, a gentleman of high character and estimation, acquired amongst the troops in Flanders : he was, in consequence, sent for to Brazil to oppose the progress which the Dutch were making; he completely fulfilled the  object for which he was chosen, until, in the year 1634, he was destined to drive the Dutch from the island of Curazao, delivering the government to, 
18. Pedro de Silva, who took possession in 1635 : but a rivalship having arisen between him and the general of the troops, Conde Banholo ; he, with heroic disinterestedness, ceded to him the government and all the faculties ; admonishing him, however, strongly to mind the public weal. This action was rewarded by the king, who immediately gave him the title of Count of San Lorenzo, and nominated him as successor to the government. 
19. Don Fernando Mascarenas, Count of La Torre, a person of the highest consequence in Portugal, on account of his birth, virtues, personal qualities, and military tactics : he entered La Bahia in 1639, and taking the command of the army against the Dutch, ceded the political government to, 
20. Don Vasco Mascarenas, Count of Ovidos, who exercised it until the year 1640, when the king nominated, 
21. Don Jorge Mascarenas, Marquis ofMontalvan, the first who had the title of viceroy, but who, being immersed in ruinous litigations, was deposed and sent to Lisbon, in 1641, by the bishop, Don Pedro de Silva, the commander, Luis Becerra, and the chief overseer, Lorenzo de Brito Correa : these took to themselves the government, though their conduct was disapproved by the new king, Don Juan IV. formerly Duke of Braganzaw 
22. Antonio Tellez de Meneses, Count of Villa Pouca, of high blood and of great merits, acquired in India : he governed with address until the year 1652. 
23. Juan Rodriguez de Vasconcelos, Count of Castelmayor, illustrious.for his birth, and for the unjust imprisonment which he suffered in Cartagena : he was commander of the armies of Portugal in the provinces of Entre Douro y Mino and of Alentejo ; from whence he passed over to Brazil in 1653. 
24. Don Jeronimo de Ataide, Count of Atoguia, who, both in the court and in the field, had filled the highest situations with great credit and address : he was governor of the province of Tres Monies at the time of his being called to this; here also his rectitude and affability have perpetuated the memory of his government; he continued in office until the year 1657. 
25. Francisco Barreto de Meneses, nominated by the Queen Regent of Portugal, as a reward for his prowess and valour exhibited in the recovery of Pernambuco, where he was brigadiergeneral ; he however testified a certain haughtin b 2   BRAZIL.  ness of disposition in some private dissensions, and a successor was nominated in, 
Don Vasco Mascarefias, Count of Ovidos, governor of the armies and province of Alentejo, who had been viceroy of India, of the council of state, and second viceroy of the kingdom of Brazil: he entered in the year 1664, and owing to the skill he had obtained from having been brigadier and general of the artillery, he governed with great address five years, until 1668. 
27. Alexandro de Sousa Freyre, who, after a very meritorious career, was governor of the fort of Mazagan in Africa : he was removed to this government, where he remained until 1671. 
28. Alonso Thurtado de Mendoza, esteemed equally for his noble birth as for his heroic valour ; he being renowned amongst the greatest warriors of his age. Disappointment in his attempts to discover some mines caused his death in 1675 ; but he had nominated, as governor for the interim, chancellor, Augustin Acevedo Montero, the eldest brigadier, Alvaro de Acevedo, and the eldest judge, Antonio Guedes de Brito ; these governed for upwards of two years, until 1678, when the right successor arrived, viz. 
29. Roque de Acosta Barreto, a person whose good qualities had secured the favour of the court, and had obtained for him employments equal to his pretensions : he was majorgeneral in the province of Brazil at the time that he was nominated governor and captaingeneral of Brazil ; and the applause which he deserved by his virtues warranted his election ; for the kingdom had to reckon him amongst the best of its governors ; here he continued until the year 1682. 

SO. Antonio de Sousa Meneses, a man of great merits : he had lost an arm, which was replaced by one of silver ; he had grown old in government and in various employs, and indeed he was at this time rather superannuated ; the consequence was, that great dissensions and commotions marked the period of his government, which lasted until 1682, when arrived, 
31. Don Antonio Luis de Sousa, Tello de Meneses, Marquis of Las Minas : he was found exercising the government of Las Armas, and province of Entre Douro and Mino, from whence he was withdrawn, on account of his wellestablished fame, to settle the disturbances prevailing in Brazil; tothese he lent his most serious attention : he was also serviceable in rendering succour and assistance to the natives during the terrible contagion which they suffered during his government; this lasted until 1687, when soliciting his return to Lisbon, a suo suocessor was appointed in the person of,  
32. Matias de Acuna, commissary -general of the cavalry ofMontejo, brigadier of the 3d regiment of the Armada, and governor of the Rio Janeiro, and afterwards of the province of Entre Douro y Mino : here he displayed much talent and justice ; but died in a short time, in 1688, nominating, in the interim, with the approbation of all, a successor in the archbishop, Don Fr. Manuel de la Resurreccion, who kept the reins of government until the year 1690. 
33. Antonio Luis Gonzalez de Camara Coutinho, who was at that time governor of the province of Pernarnbuco, and was elected to the captainshipgeneral of Brazil, of which he took possession in 1690, and which he exercised until 1694. 
34. John of Lancaster, of the royal family of England, who began his military career at a very early age, and being captain of horse, distinguished himself in the battle of the Canal : he was afterwards brigadiergeneral of the 3d regiment of the Armada, governor and captaingeneral of Angola, general of the horse of Alentejo, and, lastly, captaingeneral of Brazil, of which dignity he took possession in 1694 ; and during a much longer government than was usually enjoyed, he gave evident proofs of the extent of his abilities, by the excellence of his plans for the public emolument, and for the beneficence he shewed to those around him ; he was succeeded in 1732 by, 
35. Don Rodrigo de Costa, who, by his birth and merits, had been the favourite of the monarchs and governors of the island of Madeira : he was 
( made captaingeneral of Brazil, and from thence promoted to the viceroyalty of India in 1705 ; he was succeeded by, 
36. Luis Cesar de Meneses, chief ensign of the kingdom of Portugal, a descendant of the renowned Vasco Fernandez, and known alike for his happy government in the Rio Janeiro, and in the kingdom of Angola, as for that of the city of Ebora, in the war of the succession of Philip V. king of Spain : he came over to Brazil in 1705, and remained with singular credit, until 1710, when arrived his successor, 
37. Don Lorenzo de Almada, who was received with some degree of discontent ; a true presage of the ills and disturbances which marked his government, and of the disputes which arose with the government of Pernarnbuco: all these made him very willing to resign his post, which he did in the following year, 1711, in favour of his successor, 
38. Don Pedro de Vasconcelos y Sousa, esteemed for his valour and conduct during the war : he was brigadiergeneral at the time that he wa*  t-»"  

BRAZIL.  appointed to the government of Brazil, where the memory of his predecessor and grandfather, the Count of Castlemayor, caused him to be received •with great expectations; but these were soon frustrated by the disturbances at Pernambuco, the invasion of Rio Janeiro by the French, and the taking of Bahia ; which unlucky circumstances made him earnest in his entreaties to the king to appoint a successor : his request was complied with. 
39. Don Pedro Antonio de Norona, Marquis of Angeja, counsellor of state, and inspectorgeneral •of the royal estates : he had from a very early age an eye to the viceroyalty of India ; and actually entered it with the title of viceroy, in 1714 ; his government was marked by the most prudent regulations, and lasted until 1718. 
40. Don Sancho de Faro, Count of Vimeiro, of the royal house of Braganza, by the male line x he served in the wars of this country, and was master of the horse to her most serene highness the Queen Maria Ana of Austria ; was governor of Mazagan and of the province of Miiio, when he was nominated captaingeneral of Brazil ■in 1718 ; where he however shewed more zeal than fortune in his undertakings, and in little more than a year terminated his career, leaving the government to the charge of the archbishop, Don Sebastian Monteiro da Vide, to the brigadiergeneral, Don Juan de Araujo y Accevedo, and to the oidor, Don Cayetano Brito de Figueredo, who conjointly governed until the year 1720, when arrived the right successor"., 
41. Don Vasco Fernandez Cesar de Meneses, son of Don Luis Vasco Cesar de Meneses, and nephew of John of Lancaster, both of whom had governed in Brazil : he was distinguished by his conduct in war, and was thought deserving of being appointed by the king to the viceroyalty of India, and was destined to govern Brazil in 1720 ; when, by his nice discernment and wellregulated plans, he nearly eclipsed all those who had gone before him, and governed until 1724. The succeeding governors were as follows : 
Don And res de Mello y Castro, Count of Galveas. 
The Count of Anloguia. 
The Count of Los Arcos. 
The Marquis of Labradio, the father. 
The Count Bobadela, who died before he arrived to take possession. 
The Count of Asambuja. 
The Marquis of Labradio, the last son of those who enjoyed the title of viceroy. 
The Count of Povolide, the first who, with the title of governor and captaingeneral, established himself in the Rio Janeiro.  
Don Manuel de A curia Meneses. 
The Marquis of Valencia. 
Don Rodrigo Joseph de Meneses.

1. Discovery. — The coast of Brazil,as has been before observed,was first discovered by VincenteYafiez Pinzon. He had sailed with Columbus in 1498, on his first voyage, as commander and master of the Nina. Seven years afterwards he and his nephew Arias obtained a commission to go in search of new countries, and trade in any which Columbus had not previously appropriated. The Pinzons were wealthy men, and the former voyage had added to their wealth ; they fitted out four caravels at their own cost, and set sail from Palos in December 1499, made the cape de Verds, then steered to the s. w. and were the first Spaniards who crossed the line and lost sight of the n. star. After suffering intolerable heat, and storms which drove them on their way, they saw land on January 26, 1500, in lat. 8£° s. to which Vincente gave the name of cape Consolation ; but which is now called cape St. Augustines. They landed, cut the names of the ships, and the date of the year and day upon the trees and i - ocks, and took possession of the country for the crown of Castillc. 
The coast which Pinzon had discovered lay within the Portuguese limits of demarcation ; and before he reached Europe, in 1500, it had been taken possession of by the nation to whom it was allotted. As soon as Vasco da Gama had returned from the discovery of India, King Emanuel fitted out a second and far more powerful expedition, to the command of which he appointed the Fidalgo Pedro Alvarez Cabral. 
2. Possession taken for the crown of Portugal. — The Portuguese ships of discovery had hitherto taken out stone pillars, with the arms of Portugal engraved thereon, to set up in the lands which they might find, and by this act secure them for King Emanuel. Cabral, upon his landing at Puerto Seguro, was not provided with these pillars, because his destination was to follow the track of Gama ; possession had been taken all the way which he was to steer, and no discovery of new countries was expected from him. He erected a stone cross instead, and took possession of the whole province for the crown of Portugal, naming it Santa Cruz, or the Land of the Holy Cross. 
3. The country obtains the name of Brazil.--- But the honour of having formed the first settle-  ment in this country, is due to Amerigo Vespucci in 1504. It does not appear that any farther attention was at this time paid to it. No gold had been found, and it produced no articles of commerce which could be thought worthy the notice of a government whose coffers were overflowing with the produce of the spice trade, and the riches of the African mines. But the cargo of Brazil Avhich Vespucci had brought home, tempted private adventurers, who were content with peaceful gains, to trade thither for that valuable wood ; and this trade became so well known, that in consequence the coast and the whole country obtained the name of Brazil, notwithstanding the holier appellation which Cabral had given it. 
4. Criminals sent to serve there.— It was the system of the Portuguese government to make its criminals of some use to the state, and this system was extended to Brazil ; for the first Europeans who were left ashore there were two convicts. 
5. Brazil divided into captaincies.— \t was not until thirty years after its discovery, that the country appears to have become of sufficient importance to have obtained any consideration at court ; and in order to forward its colonization, the same plan was adopted which had succeeded well in Madeira and in the Azores, that of dividing it into hereditary captaincies, and granting them to such persons as were willing to embark adequate means in the adventure, with powers of jurisdiction, both civil and criminal, so extensive as to be in fact unlimited. This method was thought to be the easiest and least expensive to government. The difference between desert islands and a peopled continent had not been considered. The captains of the islands might easily settle lands in which there could be no opposition, and easily at any time assist each other with supplies : if their means failed, they could even borrow from Portugal, those places being so near that they were regarded almost as things within the country. B # ut when Joam divided the coast of Brazil into great captaincies, each extending along 50 leagues of coast, large tribes of savages were in possession of the Country, Portugal was far distant, and the settlements so far asunder, that one could not possibly afford assistance to another. 
6. Martini Affonso de Sousa.— The first person who took possession of one of these captaincies was Martini Aftbnso de Sousa, whose name frequently occurs in the history of Portuguese India, where he was afterwards governor, and who is famous in Catholic history for having carried out St. Francisco Zavier to the east. He and his brother, Pero Lopes de Sousa, having each obtained]  r ^-m ■

[a grant, fitted oiit a considerable armament, and ■went to explore the country, and form their settlement in person. He began to survey the coast somewhere about Rio de Janeiro, to which he gave that name, because he discovered it on theiirst of January ; and he proceeded s. as far as the Plata, naming the places which he surveyed on the way, from the days on which the several discoveries were made. Having well examined the coast, he fixed upon one of these islands for his settlement, which, like Goa, are separated from the main land by an elbow of the sea; but this spot, which had been chosen for the new town, was not found convenient, and the colonists round removed to the adjoining isle of St. Vincente, from which the captaincy derives its name. 
7. The first sugar'canes planted. — About the year 1531, Martim AfFonso made an unsuccessful expedition southward into the interior, in search of mines, from which he returned with the loss of 80 Europeans. In all other respects his colony was fortunate. Here the first sugarcanes were planted, which were brought from Madeira ; here the first cattle were reared ; and here the other captaincies stocked themselves with both. Whether the honour of having introduced them into Brazil be due to the founder of the colony is not stated : a battle or a massacre would have been recorded. The king, after some time, recalled Martim AfFonso, and sent him to India ; but when he returned to Portugal, he watched over the welfare of his captaincy, sending out supplies and settlers ; and it descended in a flourishing condition to his son. Wheat and barley were little used here, because the food of the country was liked so well ; what little wheat was raised was for delicacies, and for the wafer. Marmalade was made here, and sold to the other captaincies. Oysters of such a size are found here, that their shells are used for dishes ; and once, when a bishop of Bahia visited this province, they washed his feet in one, as in a basin. The whole coast abounds with shellfish, which the natives came down from the interior to catch at certain seasons : they built their huts upon some dry spot amid the mango groves, fed upon fish while the fishery lasted, and dried them to carry home. So long had this practice been continued, that hills had accumulated of the shells, soil collected on them, and trees taken root there and grown to maturity. These hills, which are called ostreiras, have supplied all the lime that has been used in the captaincy, from its foundation to the present day. In some of them the shells are formed into limestone ; in others they are unchanged ; tools and broken pottery of the Indians  are frequently found in them, and bones of the dead ; for they who died during the fishing season, were laid on these heaps, and covered over with shells. 
8. St. Amaro and Tamaraco. — Pero Lopes de Sousa was less fortunate than his brother. He chose to have his 50 leagues of coast in two allotments. The one, which obtained the name of St. Amaro, adjoined St. Vincente, and bordered so close upon the main settlement, the towns being only three leagues asunder, that if they had not belonged to two brothers, the settlers would have but ill agreed. As long as this was the case, the neighbourhood was advantageous to both ; but when the property devolved to other possessors, between whom there were not the same ties, it became an endless cause of litigation. Tamaraca, the other division, lay between Pernambuco and Paraiba, many degrees nearer the line. Here he had some hard conflicts with the Pitiguares, who besieged him in his town ; but he succeeded at length in driving them from the neighbourhood. Soon afterwards he perished by shipwreck. 
9. Paraiba. — A fidalgo, by name Pedro de Goes, had been one of the companions cf Pero Lopes, and had suffered shipwreck with him in the Plata ; but neither this, nor the disastrous fate of his friend, disheartened him. He became fond of Brazil, and asked for a captaincy when the king was disposing of them in such prodigal grants. It seems that he had no great interest at court, for his grant was restricted to SO leagues of coast, between the captaincies of St. Vincente and Espiritu Santo ; if the space between them did not extend to so much, he was to take it such as it was. Goes embarked the whole of his property upon the adventure, and many thousand crowns were advanced by a certain Martim Ferreira, who proposed to have sugarworks established there upon their joint account. The expedition sailed to the river Paraiba, and there Goes fortified himself, and remained two years at peace with the Goeytacazes. After that time war broke out between them, and continued five years, to his great loss : peace was made, and soon broken by the savages. There is no reason to suspect the Portuguese of being the aggressors in this instance, it was too much their interest to keep the treaty. The colonists were weak and utterly dispirited : they became clamorous to quit the unlucky settlement, and Goes was obliged to yield to their clamours, and evacuate it. Vessels were obtained from Espiritu Santo to bring them away. 
10. The Goeytacazes. — The tribe which expelled Goes were probably of the same stock as the]   Brazil.  
[Goaynazes, and like them, did not devour tbeir prisoners. They were fairer than the other savages, and their language, it is said, more barbarous, which may be understood to mean that some of its sounds were more difficult. They were a braver race, and fought not in woods and ambushes, but in open field. They would swim off shore with a short stick in the hand, sharp at both ends ; with this they would attack a shark, thrust it into his  gag him,  then drown him, drag and head their arrows  open mouth and him ashore, eat the flesh. with his teeth. 
11. Espiritu Santo. — The captaincy of Espiritu Santo was at this time next to St. Amaro ; for Rio de Janeiro was not settled till a later period. This was asked and obtained by Vasco Fernandes Coutinho, a fidalgo, who having spent the best years of his life in India, and amassed a fortune there, ventured and lost the whole in this scheme of colonization. His limits were to begin where those of Puerto Seguro ended on the s. He fitted out a great expedition, in which not less than 60 fidalgos and men of the royal household embarked. DonSimam de Castello-Branco, and Don Jorge de Menezes, were sent with him as degradados, that is to say, banished men. Of all shocking tyrannies, that of the Portuguese in the Spice islands stands among the foremost in atrocity, and Don Jorge de Menezes, in the first rank^ of their tyrants for diabolical cruelty. Indeed in an age when the cruelties of Vasco da Gama, and the great Albuquerque, were recorded without one word of reprehension 7 as doubtless they were without one feeling of humanity, it may well be supposed, when aman of family and fortune was banished for such offences to Brazil, what the measure of those offences must have been. They had a prosperous voyage to their place of destination, and began a town, to which they gave the name of Our Lady of Victory, before the battle had been fought. The title was for a while sufficiently verified, and the Goaynazes, the first enemies with whom they had to deal, were defeated in some of the first engagements. The building went on with spirit ; canes were planted, four sugarworks established, and Coutinho, seeing every thing thus prosperous, went to Lisbon to collect more colonists, and procure stores and implements for an expedition into the country, in search of mines. 
12. The Papanazes. — The coast of this and the next captaincy had been possessed by the Papanazes, but they were now driven back by the Goaytacazes and the Tupiniqnins. The language of the Papanazes was scarcely understood by these ene-  notwithstandinj;- their  long  wars. They  were hunters and fishers, and slept upon the ground on leaves. If one of them killed another, he was* delivered up to the relations of the dead, and inthepresence of all the kindred of both parties, immediately strangled and interred. All parties lamented loudly at the execution ; they then feasted and drank together for many days, and no enmity remained. Even if the deed was accidental, the punishment was the same. Should the offender have escaped, his son, his daughter, or the nearest of his blood, was given up in his stead ; but the substitute, instead of suffering death, remained a slave to the nearest relation of the slain. 
13. Puerto Seguro. — The adjoining captaincy of Puerto Seguro was allotted to Pedro de Campo Tourinho, a native of Viana daFozdeLima, of noble family, and an excellent navigator. He sold all that he possessed in Portugal to embark it inthis expedition, and set sail with his wife and family, and a large body of colonists. They landed in the harbour where Cabral had taken possession of Brazil, and there fortified themselves upon a spot which, retains the name of Puerto Seguro, given it by that discoverer, and which still remains the capital of the captaincy. 
14. The Tupiniqnins. — The Tupiniquins made some opposition at first. They possessed the country from the river Camamu to the river Circare,an extent of nearly five degrees ; and the first settlers in thisandthetwoadjoining captaincies had to maintain their ground against them. Peace however was soon made,, and the Tupiniqnins observed 1 k faithfully. They were sometimes at war witli the Tupinaes ; but these tribes, being of the samestock, did not regard each other as regularly and' naturally enemies, and their quarrels were considered as mere accidental circumstances, which were to leave no&gt; hatred behind; the two tribes blended at last into one. Of all the Brazilians,- these are said to have been the most domestic and the most faithful, indefatigable, and excellently brave. Their manners and language resembled those of the Tupinambas ; but it was so long since they had branched apart, that all memory of the common stock was lost, and there was a deadly enmity between them. The Topinambas were the most powerful ; pressed by them on the one side, by the dreadful Aymures on the other, and profitingless by the friendship of the Portuguese than they suffered from their tyranny, they gradually forsook the country. Good men were never wanting who* lifted up their voices against this tyranny and oppression ; but the guilt was so general that it has become a national imputation. Tourinho is not implicated in this guilt ; he had influence enough^   BRAZIL.  Tover the natives to collect man j of them into villages, and this is proof that he dealt towards them well and wisely. 'Sugarworks were established, with such success that they produced a considerable quantity for exportation to the mother country. No bine could be kept in this colony, because of an herb which is said to have occasioned haemorrhoids, whereof they died ; yet horses, asses, and goats, were not affected by it. The disease was probably imputed to a wrong cause. 
15. The Ilheos. — The captaincy of the isles owes its inapplicable name to the Rio dos Ilheos, a river so called because there are three islands just at its bar. Jorge de Figueiredo Correa, Escrivam da Fazenda to Joam III. was the first donatory. The office which he held prevented him from going himself to take possession of his grant ; he therefore deputed a Castillian knight, by name Francisco Romeiro. Romeiro anchored in the harbourof Tin hare, and began his new town on the height or Morro de St. Paulo, from whence however~he found it expedient to remove ittoits present situation. It was first called St. Jorge, in compliment to the lord of the te.ml ; but the same improper appellation which had been given to the captaincy extended to its capital. The Tupiniquins soon made peace with the settlers, and being of all the Brazilian tribes the most tractable, lived with them on Such friendly terms that the colony soon became prosperous. The son of the original proprietor sold the captaincy to Lucas Giraldes : he expended considerable wealth in improving it, and it flourished so well that there were in a short time eight or nine sugarworks established. 
16. Bahia.— The coast from the great Rio de S. Francisco to the Ponta da Padram de Bahia, was given to Francisco Percira Coutinho, a fidalgo who bad distinguished himself in India ; and the bay itself, with all its creeks, was afterwards added to the grant. He fixed his settlement in the bay, at the place now called Villa Velha, which was Caramuru's dwelling place ; two of his companions, who were men of noble family, married two of Caramuru's daughters, and as the natives were for his sake well aftected towards the Portugueze, every thing went on well for a time. Bahia de Todos os Santos, or AH Saints bay, wherein the capital of Brazil was afterwards erected, is unquestionably one of the finest harbours in the world. Here, as well as at Rio de Janeiro upon the same coast, the sea seems to have broken in upon the land ; or more probably some huge lake has borne down its barrier, and made way to the ocean. The entrance, which is nearly three leagues wide, is from the s. having the continent on the right hand, and the long island of Itaparica on the left. You are then in a bay, extending to the n. and w. a whole degree, and branching inland in every direction, with deep water every where, and many navigable rivers discharging themselves into it. This little Mediterranean is spotted with above an hundred islands. 
17. Revolutions in the Reconccvce. — The old natives preserved the memory of three revolutions in this Keconcave, as the bay with all its creeks and coves is denominated. As far back as the memory of man among savages could reach, the Tapuyas possessed it ; but as this part of Brazil is in every respect one of the most highly favoured places under heaven, it was too desirable a land to be peaceably enjoyed, when there was no other law than that of the strongest. The Tupinaes expelled them, and for many years retained possession, still keeping up war on the side of the interior with those whom they had driven there. At length the Tupinambas from the other side of the river San Francisco migrated here, and in like manner thrust out the Tupinaes, who fell back upon the Tapuyas, and drove them again before them. These last conquerors were masters of the country when the Portuguese arrived ; but they had quarrelled among themselves. Those who dwelt between the river San Francisco and the Rio Real, or Royal river, were at mortal enmity with those nearer the bay, and the inhabitants of one side the bay, with those on the other ; they carried on hostilities both by land and water, and all parties devoured their prisoners. A fresh feud broke out among those who dwelt on the e. side ; the cause was that which, in barbarous and heroic, or semibarbarous ages, has furnished so much matter for history and song. The daughter of a chief had been carried off against her father's consent ; the ravisher refused to restore her ; the father, not being powerful enough to compel him, retired with all his clan to the island of Itaparica ; the hordes upon the river Paraguazu coalesced with tiie seceders, and a deadly war began between the two parties. The Ilha do Medo, or Island of Fear, derives its name from the frequent ambushes and conflicts of which it was then made the scene. The seceders multiplied and spread along the coast of the Ilheos, and the feud in all its rancour was perpetuated. 
18. Expulsion of Coutinho. — This was the state of the Tupinambas in Bahia, when Coutinho formed his establishment among them. That fidalgo had served in India, and India was not a school where humanity or political wisdom was to be learnt. A son of one of the native chiefs was slain by the] c c  
%V   BRAZIL.  
[Portuguese ; the circumstances are not recorded, but it is admitted that the deed was done wrongfully. Coutinho paid dearly for his offence. These fierce savages, then the most formidable of all the Brazilian tribes, burnt down his sugarwOrks, destroyed his plantations, killed his bastard son, and after more than a seven years war, compelled him, and the wreck of his colony, to abandon the Reconcave. Caramuru followed the fate of his countrymen, and retired with them to the adjoining captaincy of the Ilheos. When they were gone, the Tupinambas began to feel the want of those articles which they were now accustomed to receive in traffic, and which, from being luxuries, they had suffered to become wants. A treaty was opened, the difference was adjusted, and Coutinho embarked to return in one caravel, and Caramuru in another. They were wrecked within the bar, on the shoals of the island Itaparica ; all and there he and his people were treacherously slain by the islanders. Caramuru and the crew of his vessel were spared ; a proof how wisely he had ever demeaned himself towards the natives. He returned to his old abode in the bay. The wife and children of Coutinho did not perish with him ; they had probably been left at Ilheos ; but he had expended the whole of his Indian spoils and of his property : they were left destitute, and came to the hospital for support. 
19. Pernambuco. — One other captaincy was established about the same time as these others, that of Pernambuco. A factory had previously been settled there, which a ship from Marseilles took, and left 70 men in it, thinking to maintain possession; but the ship was captured on her return, and intelligence being thus early obtained at Lisbon, immediate measures were taken for the recovery of the place. The donatory, Duarte Coelho Pereira, asked it as the reward of his services in India. The line of coast between the Rio de S. Francisco and the Rio de J uraza was granted him : he came himself, with his wife and children, and many of his kinsmen, to begin the colony, and landed in the port of Pernambuco ;— the entrance is through an opening in a long stone reef, and this the native name implies. O, que linda situacam para se fundar huma villa ! (O, how fine a situation for founding a town !) Duarte Coelho is said to have exclaimed on beholding it ; and hence the town was called Olinda. 
20- The Cahetes. — This coast was possessed by the Cahetes, a tribe remarkable for using boats, the fabric of which was something between thatch and being of a long and strong kind of straw knit to the timbers. These they made large  enough to carry 10 or 12 persons. They are said to have been more brutal than the other tribes, inasmuch as there was little natural affection to be perceived in them. An instance is related of one who was a slave to the Portuguese, and threw his child into the river because she cried. The single fact would prove nothing more than individual brutality ; but it is mentioned as an example of their general unfeeling nature. From these people Duarte Coelho had to gain by inches, says Rocha Pitta, what was granted him by leagues. They attacked and besieged him in his new town. The French, who now (about the year 1540) were trading to that coast, led them on ; their numbers were very great, and had he been less experienced, or less able in war, his colony would probably have been rooted out. He was wounded during the siege, many of his people slain, and the place •reduced to extremity ; nevertheless they beat off the enemy, and having made an alliance with the Tobayares, bad strength and spirit enough to follow up their success. 
2J. The Tobayares. — The Tobayares were the first Brazilian tribe who leagued with the Portuguese. One of their leaders, named Tabyra, possessed great talents for war, and was the scourge of the hostile savages : he went among them himself to spy out their camps, and listen to their projects : these tribes therefore must have been of one stock, and have spoken the same dialect. He laid ambushes, led on assaults in the night, and harassed them with incessant alarms. At length they assembled their whole force, came upon him and surrounded him : Tabyra sallied forth ; an arrow pierced his eye, he plucked it out, and the eyeball on it, and turning to his followers, said, he could see to beat his euemies with one ; and accordingly he gave them a complete overthrow, notwithstanding their numbers, ltagybe, the arm of iron, was another of these Tobayares, who distinguished himself on the same side ; and Piragybe, the arm of the fish, (if the name be rightly translated by this unimaginable meaning), rendered such services to thePortuguese, that he was rewarded with the order of Christ and a pension. Some years of peace and prosperity ensued : then again (about the year 1548) a war broke out, which was occasioned, as usual, by the misconduct of the settlers. This is the first war between the Portuguese and the savages, of which any detail has been preserved ; and the detail is curioUs : it is related by Hans Stade, the first person who wrote any account of Brazil. Hans was the son of a good man at Homberg in the Hessian territory. He was minded to seek his fortune in India,]   BRAZIL.  
[and with that intent sailed from Holland in a fleet of merchantmen going to Setubal for salt ; but when he reached Portugal the Indian ships were gone, so he accepted the post of gunner in a vessel bound for Brazil on a trading voyage, and carrying out convicts to Pernambuco. There was a smaller ship in company : they were well provided with all kinds of warlike stores, and had orders to attack all Frenchmen whom they might find trading in those parts. They made cape St. Augustines in 88 days, on the 28th Jan. 1548, and entered the port of Pernambuco. Here the captain delivered his convicts to Coelho, meaning to proceed and traffic wherever it might be found most convenient: it happened, however, that just at this time the natives rose against the Portuguese, and were about to besiege the settlement of Garazu, which was not far distant : Coelho could spare them no support, because he expected to be attacked himself ; he therefore requested these ships to assist him, and Hans was sent with 40 men in a boat to their succour. 
22. Siege of Garazu.— Garazu was built in the woods, upon a creek which ran about two miles inland ; its garrison, including this reinforcement, consisted of 90 Europeans and SO slaves, some of whom were Negroes, others natives. The force which attacked them was computed at 8009, probably an exaggerated number. There were no other fortifications than the palisade, which the Portuguese had adopted from the Brazilians. The besiegers piled up two rude bulwarks of trees, within which they retired at night for security against any sudden attack : they dug pits, in which they were safe from shot by day, and from which they frequently started at different times, and rushed on, hoping to win the place by surprise. When they saw the guns aimed at them they fell upon the ground. Sometimes they approached the palisade, and threw their javelins over, for the chance there was that some wound might be inflicted by their fall ; they shot fire arrows, headed with Avaxed cotton, at the houses ; and whenever they drew nigh, it was with loud threats that they would devour their enemies. The Portuguese soon began to want food, because it was the custom to dig the mandioc, of which their bread was made, every day, or at farthest on the alternate days ; and now they were blockaded, and could not go out to perform this necessary work. Two boats tvere sent for food to the island of ltamaraca, which is at the entrance of the creek, and where there was another settlement ; and Hans was of the party. The creek is narrow yi one place, and there the savages endeavoured to obstruct the na-  vigation by laying great trees across : this obstacle the Portuguese removed by main force ; but while they were thus delayed the tide was ebbing, and before the boats could reach ltamaraca they were left dry. Instead of attacking them, the savages raised a heap of dry wood between the boats and the shore, set fire to it, and threw into the flames a species of pepper which grows there abundantly, and produces a pungpnt smoke, by which they thought to suffocate, or otherwise annoy them, breath of wind from the opposite quarter would have defeated this artifice, though it failed in this instance because the wood did not burn ; and when the tide floated them, the Portuguese proceed to ltamaraca, and were there supplied with what they sought. Meantime the savages cut two large trees nearly through, which grew beside the narrowest part of the creek, and fastened to them the long and limber shoots of a plant whicli they called sippoj these shoots resemble the hop plant, except that they are thicker. When they in the boats drew nigh and perceived this, they called out to their fellows in the fort to come and help them, for the place was within hearing, though the wood con-  cealed it from sight  the savages knew what this  meant, and as soon as they began to shout, shouted also, and effectually drowned their words : all, therefore, that the Portuguese could do was, for one part of them to endeavour to confuse the enemies' attention, while the rowers pulled up for their lives : this succeeded, one of the trees went down in a slant direction on the bank, the other fell behind one of the boats, and brushed it in its fall. The siege had already lasted a month ; the savages saw themselves thus disappointed in the hope of reducing Garazu by famine ; their perseverance was exhausted, and they made peace and broke up. The Portuguese had not lost a single man, and the besiegers not many. After this easy war the colony continued to prosper during the remainder of Duarte Coelho's life. 
23. Expeditions up to 1552. — Amongst the most notable of the Portuguese expeditions to Brazil, up to the middle of the 16th century, we have to mention that of Aires da Cunha to Marafian ; that of Sebastian Cabot, that of Diego Garcia, that of D. P. de Mendoza, whose force consisted ships and 800 men, and who laid the foundation of the city of Nuestra Senorade Buenos Ayres ; that of Alonso de Cabrera, sent out to the reinforce* ment of the former ; the attempt of Gonzalo Pizarro to find the Dorado ; the voyage of Orellana, and the expedition of Hernando de Bibera, in quest of the Amazons :*but as a narration of them would not suit the plan of this work, we refer the reader] c c 2   190  

BRAZIL.  
[who may wish to know the various success with which these were carried on, to Soutliey's History of Brazil, vol. I. chapters iii. iv. v. vi. vii. 
Chap. II. Half a century had now elapsed since the discovery of" Brazil, and so much capital in the course of that time had been vested there, that these colonies began to be regarded as possessions of considerable importance. The evils of the present system of government were very great : the governor of every captaincy exercised uncontrolled authority, and consequently abused it; the property and honour and lives of the colonists were at the mercy of these lords ; and the people groaned under their intolerable oppression. Their complaints reached the king ; he took into consideration the advantages which the country promised, especially from the sukivation of sugar, and the danger there was, lest the French should succeed in establishing themselves there, and in winning the natives to their party ; and he resolved to revoke the powers of the several captains, leaving them in possession of their grants, and to appoint a governorgeneral, with full authority, civil and criminal. 
1. A governorgeneral appointed. — The person appointed to this high station was Thome de Sousa, a fidalgo, though a bastard, who had been tried and approved in the African and Indian wars. 
2. Thejirst Jesuits. — In the same year the Jesuits, who have borne so great a part in the history of S. America, first made their appearance. The names of these primary adventurers were, Father Juan de Aspilcueta, Father Antonio Pires, Father Leonardo Nunes, and the lay brethren, Vincente Rodriguez and Diogo Jacome. The following instances of the barbarous customs of the natives will give an idea of the ignorance of the minds they had to cultivate. We are informed, that •whilst preparations were making for the death of a captive, a woman was appointed to watch him, and to cohabit with him, the captor not scrupling thus to bestow his sister or his daughter. If she became pregnant this was what they wished. It was their opinion that the child proceeded wholly from the father, receiving nutrition, indeed, and birth from the mother, but nothing more. This opinion produced a horrible consequence ; the offspring of a captive was suffered to grow up, the circumstances of his birthplace and upgrowing occasioned no human feelings towards him ; it was always remembered that he was of the blood and flesh of their enemies, and when they thought him in the best condition they killed and devoured him ;  the nearest kinsman to the mother officiated as. slaughterer, and the first mouthful was given to the mother herself. But human nature partakes too much of that goodness from which it hath proceeded, ever to become totally perverted. Thewomen often took drugs to cause abortion, that they micdit be spared the misery of seeing their offspring butchered ; and they often assisted these husbands to escape, laid food for them in the woods, and sometimes fled with them. This happened frequently to the Portuguese prisoners ; the Brazilians held it dishonourable to fly, and could not always be persuaded to save themselves. A mother also was sometimes found who resolutely defended her child, till he was able to make his way to his father's trite. But the native Brazilians were not all cannibals. The Tupi race seem to have brought this custom from the interior, and it is found in all the branches of that stock. 
3. Guarani and Tupi languages. — The Tupis of Brazil, the Guaranis of Paraguay, and the Omaguas of Peru, (between whom and the nearest Guaranis there intervenes, as Hervas says, a chaos of nations), speak dialects of the same tongue, traces of which are found through an extent of 70 degrees. The Guarani is the parent language, being the most artificial ; as the Greek is more so than the Latin, the Latin than all the modern dialects which have grown out of its ruins. It bears the marks of a primitive tongue, for it abounds with monosyllables ; one word, as in the Chinese, serves for various meanings, as it is variously accented ; and every word is said to explain itself, which probably means that many are imitative sounds, and that all composites and derivatives are regularly formed. Yet from the variety of its accentuations, it is the most difficult of all the American languages. The Tupi is spoken along the whole coast of Brazil, and far into the interior, probably extending over a wider surface than any other of the native American languages. Their names for the numerals were very barbarous, and extended only as far as five ; all beyond was expressed by help of the fingers. Tupa is their word for father, for the Supreme Being, and for thunder ; it past by an easy procees from the first of these meanings to the last, and the barbarous vanity of some tribes compounded from it a name for themselves. In these words their whole theology is at once comprised and explained. 
4. Tupi priests. — Their pai/es, or priests, lived alone in dark huts, the doors of which were very small, and into which no one dared enter. Whatever they wanted was given them. They taught that it was an abominable sin for any one to refuse]  

BRAZIL.  
[them his daughter, or any thing else which they chose to ask ; and few ventured to incur the sin, for if they predicted the death of one who had offended them, the wretch took to his hammoc instantly, in such full expectation of dying, that he would neither eat nor drink, and the prediction was a sentence which faith effectually executed. Their mode of quackery was that which is common to most savage conjurers ; they sucked the part affected, and then produced a piece of wood, bone, or other extraneous substance, as what they had extracted by the operation. 
5. The mandioc the common food and drink. — The native mode of cultivating the mandioc was rude and summary; they cut down the trees, let them lie till they were dry enough to burn, and then planted them anew between the stumps. They ate the dry flour in a manner which baffled all attempts at imitation ; for, taking it between their fingers, they tossed it into their mouths so neatly that not a single grain fell beside. No European ever tried to perform this feat without powdering his face or his clothes, to the amusement of the savages. When the mandioc failed, what they called stickflour (in Portuguese farinha de pao) was made from the wood of the urucuriiba, which they cut in pieces and bruised ; and this being less liable to corrupt than the mandioc, is now generally used in the Brazilian ships. The mandioc supplied them also with their banqeting drink. They prepared it by a curious process, which savage man has often been ingenious enough to invent, and never cleanly enough to reject. The roots were sliced, boiled till they became soft, and set aside to cool. The young women then chewed them, after which they were returned into the yessel, which was filled with water, and once more boiled, being stirred the whole time. When this had been continued sufficiently long, the unstrained contents were poured into earthen jars of great size, which were buried up to the middle in the floor of the house ; these were closely stopt, and in the course of two days fermentation took place. They had an odd superstition, that if it was made by men it would be good for nothing. They never ate at their drinking parties, nor ever desisted from drinking while one drop of liquor remained ; but having exhausted all in one house, removed to the next, and so on till thqy had drank out all in the town. Fond as the native Brazilians were of fermented liquors, they were as nice in the choice of water as we are respecting wine, and wondered at the imprudence or ignorance of the Europeans in seeming to be indifferent concerning the quality of what they drank. They preferred  the sweetest, lightest, and such as deposited no sediment, and they kept it in vessels of porous pottery, so that it was kept cool by constant transudation. Pure water exposed to the morning dew, and to the air, was a favourite remedy both with the native and Portuguese empirics ; the air and dew were supposed to temper it, and to separate its terrestrial from its aerial parts. It is subject of speculation, whether the philosophy of this quackery could have been of savage growth ? - 6. Marriages. — No man married till lie had taken an enemy, nor was suffered to partake of the drinkingfeast while he remained single. As soon as a girl became marriageable, her hair was cut off and her back scarified, and she wore a necklace of the teeth of beasts till the hair again. The scars thus made were considered honourable ornaments. Cotton cords were tied round her waist and round the fleshy part of both arms ; they denoted a state of maidenhood, and if any but a maiden wore them, they were persuaded that the anhanga would fetch her. away. This seems to have been a gratuitous superstition ; it cannot have been invented for the purpose of keeping the women chaste till marriage, for these bands were broken without fear, and incontinence was not regarded as an offence. Chastity, like compassion, is one of the virtues of civilization seeds are in us, butwill not grow up without culture. Their custom of herding together in large and undivided dormitories produced an obvious and pernicious effect : all decency was destroyed by it; universal lewdness was the consequence ; and this in its turn led to the most loathsome of all outrages against human nature. If a man was tired of a wife he gave her away, and he took as many as he pleased. The first had some privileges ; she had a separate birth in the dormitory, and a field which she cultivated for her own use. These privileges however did not prevent her from being envious of those who supplanted her ; and the wives who found themselves neglected, consoled themselves by initiating the boys in debauchery: The husbands seem to have known nothing of jealousy ; it cannot perhaps exist without love, and love also is a refinement. There prevailed among them the Jewish custom, that the brother or nearest kinsman of the deceased took his widow to wife. 
7. Condition of women amvng them. — The more brutal the tribe, the worse always is the treatment of the Avomen. The Tupinambas were in many respects an improved race ; their wives had something more than their due share of labour, but they were not treated with brutality, and their]   BRAZIL.  
[condition was on the whole happy. They set and dug the mandioc ; they sowed and gathered the maize. An odd superstition prevailed, that if a sort of earthalmond, which the Portuguese call amendoens, was planted by men, it would not grow. The Tupinambas were fond of acting upon a physical theory ; and it is probable, that in this allotment of agricultural labours, they proceeded upon the same hypothesis as the more barbarous savages of the Orinoco, who explained it to Gumilla when he remontrated against it. Father, said they, you do not understand our custom, and that is the reason why you do not like it. Women know how to bring forth, which is a thing that we do not know. When they sow and plant, the stalk of maize produces two or three heads, the root of mandioc two or three baskets full, and every tiling multiplies in like manner from their hands. Spinning and weaving, for they had a sort of loom, were properly the women's work. Having taken the cotton from the pod, they pulled it abroad; no distaff was used; the spindle was about a foot long and a finger thick ; it was passed through a little ball, and the thread fastened to the top ; this they twirled between the hands, and sent spinning into the air : they could do it as they walked. In this manner they made cords strong enough for their hammocs, and likewise so fine a thread, that a waistcoat woven of it, which De Lery took to France, was mistaken there for silk. When their hammoc was dirty, as it must soon have been soiled by the smoke of their everlasting fires, they bleached it by means of a sort of gourd, which, when cut in pieces, boiled, and stirred, raised a lather, and being used as soap, made the cotton white as snow. The women were skilful potters. They dried their vessels in the sun, then inverted them, and covered them with dry bark, to which they set fire, and thus baked them sufficiently. Many of the American tribes carried this art to great perfection ; there are some Avho bury their dead in jars large enough to receive them erect. The Tupinambas, by means of some white liquid, glazed the inside of their utensils so well, that it is said the potters in France could not do it better. The outside was generally finished with less care ; those however in which they kept their food were frequently painted in scrolls and flourishes, intricately intertwisted and nicely execubut after no pattern; nor could they copy what they had once produced. This earthen ware was in common use, and De Lery observes, that in this respect the savages were better furnished than those persons in his own country who fed from trenchers and wooden bowls.  
They made baskets both of wickerwork and of straw. 
8. Other customs of the Tupi tribes. — The men were not deficient in ingenuity. They cut the trunk of the Goayambira, a tree which is about the girth of a man's leg, in lengths often or twelve palms, and slipt the bark off whole ; this served them as a case for their bows and arrows. Bark canoes they made whole. The tree which was used for this purpose is called by Stade yga~ ywcra; they took off the bark in one piece, then keeping the middle straight and stretched by means of thwarts, they curved and contracted the two ends by fire, and the boat was made. The bark was about an inch in thickness ; the canoe commonly four feet wide, and some 40 in length ; some would carry thirty persons. They seldom went more than half a league from the coast, and if the weather was bad, they landed and carried the canoe on shore. Their modes of fishing evinced much dexterity; yet it is remarkable that they had not applied the net to this purpose, as their hammocs were of network. They pierced the fish with arrows, and if a larger one carried the arrow down, would dive to the depth of six fathoms in pursuit. Such was their power in the water that they caught fish by the hand, and did not fear to attack the great Watersnake in its own element. Another method was by beating the water, while some of the party were ready with gourds, scooped like a bowl, to slip under the smaller fry, as they rose, stunned or stupified, to the surface. For angling they used a thorn, till hooks were introduced among them ; these were what the children were particularly desirous of obtaining from the Europeans. When they went on the water to angle, it was upon a raft composed of five or six lengths of wood, about arm thick, fastened together with withes, just long and wide enough to support them ; on this they sat with their legs extended, and paddled out to* sea. Sometimes they dammed a stream and poisoned the water. This art, though generally known among the American Indians, seems no where to have been generally used ; partly perhaps because they had discovered that it was destructive to the young fry, and also because it requires no exertion of skill, and affords none of the pleasure and uncertainty of pursuit. They preserved fish by drying it on the boucan, (a method which preserves it from becoming putrid, and from worms, but not from a species of mite, which is very destructive), and then reducing it to powder. In catching monkeys for their European customers they were less ingenious ; they had no]  

BRAZIL.  £ better device than to bring the animal down with an arrow, and then heal the wound. They were fond of taming birds and of teaching parrots to talk. Some of these birds were at perfect liberty, and flew whither they would, yet were so familiar with those who fed and fondled them, that they would come from the woods at a call. Lizards were suffered to live in their houses ; so also was a large species of harmless snake. Dogs were soon obtained from the Portuguese, and in less than half a century after the discovery of the new world, European poultry Avere domesticated among half the tribes of South America. The Tupinambas had a method of dying their feathers with Brazil wood : they kept them in large hollow canes, which were closed with wax, to preserve them from a mischievous species of moth, called arauers; these insects made quick work with leather ; cuirasses and bucklers were soon skinned by them ; and if the carcase of a beast was left uncovered for a single night, they would make the bones clean by the morning. 
9. Their treatment of strangers. — As soon as a guest arrived at one of their villages, he went, if he was a stranger, to the dwelling of the chief, at the entrance of whose birth a hammoc was swung for him. The chief then came and questioned him, while the others sat round and listened in silence. The elders afterwards consulted apart concerning him, whether he were an enemy who was come to spy out their weakness : an enemy had little chance of escaping their penetration, and if he were detected he was put to death. But if the newcomer had formerly been a guest, he went to the same family which he had before visited, and whose privilege it was to exercise the rights of hospitality towards him for ever after : if he betook himself to another host, it was an affront to them. The master of the family resigned to him his own hammoc, and the wife brought him food before they asked any questions. Then the women came round, and seated themselves on the floor, hid their faces with their hands, and began to lament, he also joining in the lamentation, and not nnfrequently shedding real tears. This custom prevails extensively among the Indians, and is more natural than may perhaps immediately be perceived : for the feeling which first rises is of the lapse of time since their last meeting, of the friends whom they have lost during that interval, and of the changes and chances of human life. It is remarkable that they had no propensity to thieving. On' De Lery's first visit to them, one took his hat and put it on ; another girded on his sword to his naked side ; a third dressed himself in his doublet. He was a little alarmed at being thus  when travelling in their com-  undressed, but it was their custom, and every thing was soon restored. They were a grateful race, and remembered that they had received gifts after the giver had forgotten it. They were liberal, as ready to bestow as to ask ; whatever the house contained was at the guest's service, and any one might partake their food. They were willing, and even watchful to oblige; if an European, whom they liked, was weary pany, they would cheerfully carry him 
10. Treatment of the sick, tyc. — it is among the worst parts of their character, that they were unfeeling to the sick, and when they thought the case hopeless, neglected to give them food, so that many died rather of want than of disease. In their burials they tied fast the limbs of the dead man, that he might not be able to get up, and infest his friends with his visits ; and whoever happened to have any thing which had belonged to the dead, produced it, that it might be buried with him, lest he should come and claim it. The nearest relation dug the grave : when the wife died it was the husband's office, and he assisted to lay her there,. One cause which retarded the improvement of the Tupi tribe was the practice of frequently removing their habitations. They never remained longer in one place than the palm thatch of their houses lasted : as soon as that rotted and let in the rain, instead of repairing it, they migrated. This was not because the adjoining soil had been exhausted, but from a persuasion that change of abode was essential to health ; and a superstition,that if they departed from the custom of their forefathers, they should be destroyed. When they removed, the women were the beasts of burthen, and carried the hammocs, pots, wooden pestles and mortars, and all other household stock. The husband only took his weapons, and the wife, says Marcgraff, is loaded like a mule. She swings a great basket behind her by a band which passes over the forehead, carries another on her head, and has several empty gourds, which are for drinking vessels, hanging at her side ; one of these serves as a saddle for the child, who sits astride it, and holds on. Being thus equipped, she carries the parrot in one hand, and leads the dog with the other. If it rained while they were on their way, they fixed, two stakes in the ground, and made a thatch with palm leaves, sufficient against wind and weather for the service of the night. 
11. The first bishop. — We shall here resume the thread of our history : The number of Jesuits soon began to increase, and in the year 1552 there arrived in Brazil D. Pedro Fernandes Sardinha, as bishop of Brazil ; bringing with him priests,]   i  BRAZIL.  
[canon?, and dignitaries, and church ornaments of every kind for his cathedral : he had studied and graduated at Paris, had held the office of vicargeneral in India, and, unhappily for himself, was now sent to Bahia. At this time no better colonists could be sent out than the clergy, for none were employed upon this mission except such as were selected for their peculiar fitness for the service. From the time of its earliest discovery, the French had frequented the coasts of Brazil, though the first regular attempt at establishing themselves was in the Rio de Janeiro, under Nicholas Durand de Villegagnon, in 1558. The wars of the Portuguese with the French being a subject of little interest, we pass on to the period when the kingdom was divided into two governments, which was in the year 1572. 
12. Brazil divided into two governments,— St; Sebastian's was the seat of the new one, which began with the captaincy of Puerto Seguro, and included every thing south of it. The French, driven as they had repeatedly been from Brazil, whenever they attempted to form even a factory there, would not abandon the trade of that country. They indeed made a stand at Paraiba in 1583, but even here they were dislodged. 
13. Intercourse of the English with Brazil. — It was about the same time that the subjection of Portugal to Spain had involved Brazil in hostilities with the English, who till now had never appeared there as enemies, though they had traded with the Indians before the foundation of St. Salvador. Be it observed, that Englishmen were hated by all the Spaniards in America, and were considered as pirates. 
14. Their expeditions. — The first act of hostility Avhich the English committed in Brazil was under Fenton, and in this they were not the aggressors ; but Brazil was now become a Spanish colony, and therefore exposed to the depredations of every freebooter. Three years after Fenton's return, in 1586, another expedition was destined for the S. sea, and its instructions were not equally pacific. The Earl of Cumberland was at the charge of this adventure, of which Robert Withrington had the command ; it was joined by two other privateers, one of which was fitted out by Raleigh. After this expedition followed two others, one under Cavendish in 1592, the other under Lancaster in 1594, both inconsiderable alike in their means and intent. 
Chap. III. 1. Maranan and Para formed into a slate independent of Brazil. — The wars between the French and the Portuguese up to the year 1624 are also  little worthy of note; but the consequence of thenS was, that Maranan and Para were separated from the general government of Brazil with the title of estado or state, and Francisco Coelho de Carvalho was appointed the first governor. The evil days however of Brazil were now drawing on, and the Portuguese, instead of extending their settlements in that country, were on the point of losing all that they possessed there. 
2. A Dutch company formed. — In 1623 a Dutch company was formed, full powers being given them, and all other subjects of the United States being prohibited during a term of 24 years from trading to America, or to the opposite coast of Africa, between the cape of Good Hope and the tropic of Cancer. The company were to render an account of their proceedings every sixth year. A fleet sailed in December under the command of Jacob Willekens ; his admiral being the famous Pieter Heyne, who from being a common sailor had risen to that rank. The fleet made for St. Salvador, and this capital was taken with comparatively no resistance. The Portuguese were aware of the value of their colonies ; 100,000 crowns were given by the city of Lisbon towards the expences of government for the deliverance of St. Salvador ; the Duke of Braganza made a voluntary contribution of 20,000, the Duke of Caminha of 16,500. The nobles, perceiving that for the first time the court of Madrid was zealous for the welfare of Portugal, and flattered in that the king had written to them with his own hand requesting their exertions, offered with unexampled readiness their persons and property to the public service. Men who had held the highest oSices embarked, as volunteers, among others Affonso de Noronha, who had been viceroy in India; nor was there a noble family in Portugal but had some of its sons in this armament. The capitulation of the Dutch was the natural consequence. • 3. War with the Dutch.— In 1629 a Dutch fleet, consisting of more than fifty sail, under Henrick Loncq, as general in chief, arrived at Brazil ; Pieter Adrian was admiral; colonel Wardenburg commanded the troops. They sailed from Holland in small divisions; eight ships, with the general on board, fell in with the Spanish fleet off Teneriffe, and, inferior as they were in numbers, beat it off. They reached the cape de Verds in September, but the forces under Wardenburg did not sail from the Texel till late in the succeeding month. The whole expedition consisted of about 7000 men, half of whom were soldiers. In 1634 the Dutch commissioners, who had been dispatched to Europe for reinforcements, returnedj    £a  

BRAZIL.  
[with 3500 men'; and it is worthy of observation, that the force -which Holland sent out to conquer Brazil, exceeded what Spain would send to protect it in more than the proportion of ten to one. Four 3'ears afterwards, not without several remonstrances on the part of the Brazilians, the trade was thrown open, reserving to the company the traffic in slaves, in instruments of war, and in Brazilian woods. But all persons high in office were prohibited from tradingaltogether, lest they should abuse their power for the sake of profit. One of the senators returning to Holland about this time, laid before the West India company a detailed account of the state of their conquests. They were now in possession of six provinces, extending from Seregipe to Seara. The first of these had been utterly laid waste by Giesselin and Schoppe when they conquered it ; the latter had only a single fort garrisoned by forty men, but it supplied the Dutch sometimes with allies, and with such articles as the natives collected for traffic. Pernambuco, the most important of these captaincies, contained five towns, Garazu or IguaracUj Olinda, Recife, Bella Pojuca, and Serinhaem ; it had also several villages which were equal to small towns in size. Before the Dutch invasion, there had been 121 sugarworks, each itself a village; but 34 of these were now deserted. In Itamaraca 14 works were still employed, of 23 which flourished before the conquest. Paraiba had suffered less ; 18 were at work, and only two had been destroyed. Rio Grande had originally but two, and one was ruined. In the whole of the Dutch captaincies 120 were going on ; 46 had been stopt. The tenths of their produce were leased at the following rates; those of Pernambuco for 148,500 florins ; Itamaraca and Gojanafor 19,000; Paraiba 54,000. A tax called the pensam, upon the Pernambuco sugarworks, was leased for 26,000. The small tenths, as they were called, made the whole amount to 280,900 florins. 
4. Want of colonists. — The country had severely suffered from the Dutch invasion ; large tracts were devastated, and more inhabitants had been cut off, than would in many long years be supplied by the slow course of nature. The city of Recife had thriven ; it was the seat of government, the chief military and naval post, and the great commercial mart, and houses were crowded there wherever room could be found to place them. There were Dutchmen who looked on in hope to the days when Recife would be another Tyre ; and could these men have inspired their countrymen with their own generous and enterprising spirit, that anticipation would have been realized. They vol. r*.  cried aloud for colonists; send over to us, they said, your handicrafts, whose utmost industry at home can scarcely supply for them the absolute wants of life ; here they may speedily enrich themselves. Three, four, and six florins a day, were the wages for builders and carpenters ; that kind of mechanical work which the sugarengines required, was still more highly paid. Three sorts of men, they said, were wanted in Brazil : men of capital, who would speculate in sugarworks, artificers, and persons in the employ of the company, who, when they retired from their offices, would betake themselves to agriculture, and settle themselves as quietly as upon their native soil. With such men the country would soon be as flourishing as the Dutch had found it. 
5. The Jez&amp;s. — The Portuguese were held in subjection only by fear ; but many Portuguese Jews from Holland had taken their abode in a country where they could speak their own language as well as enjoy their own religion. These were excellent subjects ; they exercised the characteristic industry of their original nation, secure of enjoying its fruits under a free government. Some of the Portuguese Brazilians also, gladly throwing off the mask which they had so Jong been compelled to wear, joined their brethren of the synagogue. The open joy with which they now celebrated their ceremonies attracted too much notice ; it excited horror in the Catholics, and even the Dutch themselves, less liberal than their own laws, pretended that the toleration of Holland did not extend to Brazil ; the senate conceded to^ and perhaps partook of the popular feeling, and hence arose the edict by which the Jews were ordered to perform their rites more in private. 
6. The savages. —The native savages, whose numbers from the Lagoas to the Potengi were estimated now at less than 2000 fighting men, had little reason to rejoice in their change of masters. Nothing but the desire of obtaining European commodities could induce them to work at all, and these commodities were now more easily attainable; yet more work was required from them, because Negroes were scarcer and, dearer than they had formerly been, some having faithfully followed kind masters in their emigration, others having gone over to the Dutch to obtain their freedom, others again more wisely joinfng their brethren at the Palmares. The article in most estimation among them was Osnaburgh linen, — with that which was manufactured at Houen and at Steinfurt they had been overstocked. The savages never could be persuaded to hire themselves for a longer term than twenty days : a Dutch overseer] 
D D   10%  

BRAZIL.  
[resided in every village to "keep them to their task, and see that their employers paid them fairly ; before the time expired they generally demanded their wages with a suspicious feeling, for which there was probably enough reason ; and when they were paid they not unfrequently fled from the unfinished job. Many employments which used to be exercised by Negroes, were now required from them, and they often took to flight in consequence. 
7. Dutch missionaries. — A few Dutch missionaries laboured to teach them a Lutheran instead of a Popish creed ; but did not succeed in making any proselytes. 
8. Force of the Dutch.- — The military force of the Dutch in Brazil amounted only to 6180 men, to whom it was supposed 1000 Indians might be added. This whole force was required for garrisons ; there was none to spare for pursuing their successes, nor even for defending the country against the marauding parties of the Portuguese. Under any minister but Olivares, Spain would have extirpated ihem in one campaign. The Dutch senator confessed in his memorial, that they owed their safety more to the negligence of the enemy than to their own strength. 
9. Their successes. — It is true, that in the course of about 13 years, the company had fitted out 800 ships, which cost 90,000,000 of livres, 3,750,000/. In this -space of time they captured 545 vessels belonging to their enemies, which, with the cargoes, sold for 180,000,000 of livres, 7,500,000/. The dividend had never been below 120 per cent, and had often risen to 50. They had, by taking advantage of the delays and misconduct of their opponents, subjugated, in the space of seven years, the captainships of Pernambuco, Tamaraca, Paraiba, and Rio Grande. In short, their efforts were attended with such astonishing success in this and other parts of America, that from the time of the consolidation of the West India company in 1624 to 1637, they had destroyed and taken from the Spaniards and Portuguese money and merchandize of various kinds, to the value of 45,000,000 of florins, or 4,500,000/. of our money ; and out of 8Q0 ships fitted out against them by the crown of Spain, they took or destroyed 547. 
10. Feats of Count Maurice. — Elated with the acquisition of this wealth, which flowed into Amsterdam instead of Lisbon, the company had resolved to attempt the conquest of the whole of the Brazils, and had entrusted this enterprise to Maurice of Nassau, a near relation of the Prince of Orange, and who ;had already greatly distinguished himself in the service of the states. The Count, alter  a very obstinate resistance, defeated the Porta* guese, and forced their camp at Porto Cabelo, though strongly entrenched. After this he laid siege to the fortress of Povacaon, and forced its garrison, of 600 men, to surrender. Count Maurice next took the town of Openeda, on the river of St. Francis^ Avhere he erected a fort, as well as another at the mouth of the river, by which he effectually covered his new conquests, after which he returned to Olinda. During his stay in this city, be was sedulously occupied in organizing the civil and military government, and in fitting out two fleets. One of these, under the command of Admiral Lichthart, was ordered to attack the s. coast of Brazil, while the other, commanded by Commodore Hanskins, was destined to a service of still greater importance, that of .securing a station on the opposite shore of Africa. With this view, it was resolved to attack the Portuguese castle of St. Goerge de la Mina, on the coast of Guinea, in the neighbourhood of which the Dutch possessed a strong settlement. Commodore Hanskins therefore joined the Dutch governor of this place on the 25th of July, when, attacking the abovementioned castle, which was then deemed one of the most formidable in that part of the world, they obliged it, after a siege of some length, to surrender. Having thus succeeded in his enterprise, the commodore returned to Olinda, where he was received by Count Maurice with all that distinction Avhich the achievement merited. The campaign of 1638 was equally glorious and successful on the part of the Dutch ; for in that year the Count took the capital of the captainship of Segerippa, and reduced the whole province under the subjection of the Dutch. These splendid successes induced the natives of Seara, one of the ti. captainships, to declare in their favour, and to offer, as the price of their restoration to liberty, to assist them against the Portuguese ; on which, a body of troops being sent to join them, these united forces soon reduced the whole district. Count Maurice now determined to attack St. Salvador, in the bay of All Saints, which was in some measure considered as the capital of all Brazil ; and with this view he embarked all the troops he could spare for this expedition at Olinda, and landed them in the bay, expecting by the promptness of bis measures to take the Portuguese by surprise. He succeeded, indeed, and without much resistance, in making himseif master of the strong fort of Albert, of that of St. Bartholomew, and of the celebrated castle of St. Philip ; and encouraged by this success, he erected two batteries, with the view of attacking fort Roses, which covered the]  
/  BRAZIL.  
$m  fcfty on one side, and a hornwork on the other. Between these lay a piece of ground covered with shrubs and bushes, where the Portuguese governor had posted himself with 400 men. This disposition was attended with the most serious consequences to the Dutch; for, after an obstinate engagement, attempting to retire by that way, they were attacked in the rear, and lost four officers of distinction, besides their principal engineer, and S00 of their best men; on which Count Maurice, abandoning the post he had taken, raised* the siege with great precipitation. In the mean time the Spanish government sent out, in the beginning of J 640, Count de las Torres with a fleet of large and small vessels, amounting to 93 sail, having J2,000 men on board. Count Maurice awaited his approach, with 41 men of :war, within, four miles of the coast of Olinda. This last fleet was commanded, under the Count, by Admiral Loos, a man of the most determined courage and bravery. These hostile fleets met and engaged, on the 12th of January, near the island of Tamaraca, and after a contest which lasted four days, the Dutch gained a complete ■victory. But an event at this time occurred in Europe, which completely changed the state of affairs in Brazil. 
The Portuguese had never been thoroughly satisfied with their situation, nor enjoyed much prosperity since their subjugation to the Spanish yoke in 1581. Philip II. it should appear, had deemed it better to reign over an enslaved nation than one owing its allegiance to the affection and goodwill of the people; and in almost every instance did he sacrifice the glory of the Portuguese name to those narrow and mistaken ideas of policy. This prince had, however, the address to conceal his real intentions under the most specious and honourable pretexts ; but his son, who pursued the same pernicious maxims of government, suffered the Portuguese to be deprived of a number of conquests which had been acquired at the expence of much blood and treasure, and had proved to them a source of glory, power, and riches. The successor of this weak monarch, possessing still less understanding than even his father, openly attacked the administration, the laws, and privileges of the Potuguese people ; and to this impolitic conduct he is said to have been instigated by the advice of Olivares, with a view to provoke a revolt, that he might obtain over them the rights of a conqueror. 
11. King John IV. — A short time however evinced how unwise had been his plans for these repeated outrages • for a conspiracy, which dur-  ing three years had been organizing with uncommon secrecy, and had united in one interest all the Portuguese whom Spain had laboured to divide, burst out with incredible fury in December 1610, when Philip IV. was ignominiously expelled from Portugal, and the Duke of Braganza, by title of John IV. placed on the throne of his ancestors. The example of the capital was soon followed by the rest of the kingdom, as well as by what remained of the colonies, settled under happier auspices in Asia, Africa, and America. The new king had scarcely ascended the throne before he united his interest and resentments with those of the English, the French, and, in short, with all the enemies of Spain. On the 23d of June 1641, he concluded an offensive and defensive alliance with the United Provinces for Europe, and a 10 years truce for the East and West Indies. Prince Maurice, who had foreseen that such an event would naturally result from the changes which had take place in Portugal, resolved to embrace the present opportunity of regaining the captainship of Segerippa, which had been wrested from him by the Portuguese. He also reduced the island of Loanda, on the coast of Conga, and that of St. Thomas, which lies directly under the equinoctial line ; after which he dispatched Admiral Lichthart and Commodore Hanskins with six men of war and an equal number of frigates, in order to reduce the island of Maranan and the town of St. Lewis. Having effected this service, the rest of the districts submitted of course, so that towards the conclusion of the year 1641 the Dutch possessed seven out of the 14 captainships into which Brazil was divided. As most of these successes were obtained after the publication of the truce abovementioned, a remonstrance was addressed to the statesgeneral by the Portuguese ambassador, representing in strong terms the unjustifiable nature of such proceedings. Some of the places in ques tion they refused, under one specious pretence or another, to relinquish ; and though orders were sent out for the delivering up others, these injunctions were drawn up in such a vague manner, that most of the Dutch governors in Brazil refused to comply with them. 
12. Refined policy of the Portuguese; — While these unjustifiable proceedings rendered the Portuguese more anxious than ever to expel the Dutch wholly from Brazil,. they had recourse to a most wise and refined piece of policy, in order to forward the accomplishment of their designs. They magnified the wisdom of the Dutch government,, apparently confided in their promises, and readily acquiesced in the validity of the excuses which] D D 2  BRAZIL.   [they offered for their nonperformance. Thrown off their guard, by what they supposed the friendly dispositions of their neighbours, Count Maurice and the directors of the West India company conceived they had nothing now to dread, either from the natives or the Portuguese.; but even these arts of their rivals would not probably have led to their final overthrow, had it not been for the narrow and illiberal views of the company itself. Fully confident that 'the Dutch had secured a firm and permanent settlement in Brazil, they dispatched orders to Count Maurice ~to adopt such measures as would augment their revenue, by forwarding vast cargoes of sugar, and the other commodities of the country-: they particularly enjoined him not to receive the debts of the company in smalLsums,, but to enforce payment all at once. Count Maurice remonstrated against these orders, and represented to the company the inconveniences and distress which would attend their execution. He represented to them, that the country had only enjoyed a short state of tranquillity, after a longprotracted and expensive war ; that most of the company's debtors were Portuguese, who had settled in their territories, and hitherto acted in the most honourable manner, and therefore ought to be treated with liberality, and not urged to extremities ; but the company were deaf to his arguments. They knew that Brazil was a rich country; and indulging a truly mercantile spirit, they could see no reason why all that it produced should not be instantly shipped for Holland. Other parts of Count Maurice's conduct likewise afforded them a subject of discontent. Opposite to the Receiffe is situated a commodious island, upon which he ordered a town to be built, and well fortified, chiefly out of the ruins of Olinda. This town, to which he gave the nftrae of Mauriceburgh, in a short time became so extensive, that he united it to the Receiffe, which was become the centre of the Dutch commerce, by means of a stone bridge. These improvements, which were undertaken for the public benefit, and with a view of securing the -company's capital from accidents, were not relished by the proprietors, as the expence attending them amounted to above 40,000/. ; but what created in their minds still greater discontent, was the splendid palace built by Count Maurice for his own use. This magnificent edifice Avas erected in such a situation as to command an extensive prospect both by sea and land ; it was surrounded by gardens, elegantly laid out, and planted with citrons, lemons, figs, and other fruittrees. In its front was a marble battery, rising gradually from the riverside, upon  which were mounted 10 pieces of cannon. The Count also possessed a large villa at a short distance in the country, encompassed by fine gardens adorned with fishponds, and protected by strong walls ; the whole being so disposed as to serve at once for the purposes of pleasure and the defence of the city, which it covered on that side as a fort. Within the fortifications were also laid out extensive parks and meadows, which, by judicious management, became capable of producing every thing necessary for the subsistence of the garrison, and in the disposition of which, utility and beauty were equally combined. 
13. The Count recalled to Europe. — Thus did Count Maurice expend the treasures., which were the fruits of his conquests and victories, in the improvement of the colony, which an individual of less generosity would have appropriated to his own private advantage. But this disinterested and publicspirited conduct, which ought to have ensured to him the applause and gratitude of his country, appears to have produced a contrary effect ; for while thus employed, it was finally resolved to recal him, as the only means of drawing from the colony such a revenue as would be proportional to the expectations of the company. In consequence of this order, the Count sailed for Europe with a fleet of 13 large ships, and near 3000 soldiers on board ; while, in conformity with the instructions he had received, and with the economical scheme of government to be pursued in future, only 18 companies were left for the defence of the whole of the Dutch settlements. 
Chap. IV. 

AFTEitthe recal of Count Maurice, the government of the Dutch possessions in Brazil was bestowed on Hamel, a merchant of Amsterdam ; Bassis, a goldsmith of Haerlem ; and Bullestraat, a carpenter of Middleburgh. To this council the decision of all commercial affairs was in future to be confined. 
These successors to the illustrious warrior and statesman who had hitherto ruled the colony, were men of unimpeachable integrity and solid good sense, but with narrow minds, and wholly unacquainted with the science of government. Under their administration the face of affairs became for a short time changed ; every department of commerce seemed to be animated with new life and vigour ; and in the year following, a greater quantity of sugar and other commodities was sent home to Europe than had ever been received in the same space of time before.

{pant/. — This dawn of prosperity proved however altogether illusory. They had sent to Holland the very produce of the lands which Count Maurice had assigned for maintaining the fortifications in a proper state of defence, by which means they were suffered to fall into ruin. They even sold the arms and ammunition, and granted passports on the most easy terms to every soldier who was desirous of returning to the mother country.. They compelled the Portuguese, who lived under their jurisdiction, to liquidate their debts to the company all at once, which rendered many of them insolvent ; and in other cases they forced the cultivators to resign the entire price of their productions, till their demands should be fully satisfied. By this conduct the public strength was annihilated, and the Portuguese began to entertain hopes that they might free themselves from the galling bondage of a foreign yoke. The last stipulation, which deprived them of those comforts and convenieacies to which they had been accustomed, above all stimulated them to attempt the recovery of their just rights. g. Conspiracy of Viera. — At the head of this •conspiracy was Juan Fernandez Viera, a Portuguese of obscure birth, who, from being a page to one of the magistrates of Olinda, had risen to be an agent, and afterwards an opulent merchant. His inflexible integrity had gained him universal esteem, and the generosity of his character had attached to him many warm and sincere friends. It was the intention of Viera and his associates to put their designs in execution on the 24th of June 1645, in the midst of the capital of Pernambuco, at an entertainment to be given at Viera's house, in honour of his marriage with one of the daughters of Antonio Cavalcante, who was himself a warm adherent to the cause. To this festival were ihvited most of the officers and principal people in the service of the company, whom the conspirators intended to seize, and then immediately attack the people, who would be wholly unprepared for their defence. The plot, however, was discovered at the moment of its execution ; but such was the consternation of the Dutch at this discovery, that Viera and his associates succeeded in escaping into the neighbouring woods, where they formed themselves into a body, and immediately took up arms. Viera now assumed the character of general and commander in chief. His name, his virtues, and the popularity of his projects, soon collected round him the Brazilians, the Portuguese soldiers, and even the colonists. Assisted by Colonel Diaz, with a few Portuguese troops, and the Brazilian, Cameron, the idol of his people, with a  numerous body of natives, he fixed quarters at Pojug, a town between the Receiffe and cape St. Augustine ; so that he commenced the war in the very heart of the Dutch dominions. Alarmed at these hostile proceedings, the council issued a proclamation, promising pardon to all those who would return to their duty, with the exception of Viera, Cavalcante, and Aragousa. They gave the command of a few illappointed troops to Huys, on whom they conferred the title of general; and dispatched two captains to the Portuguese viceroy, at the bay of AH Saints, to remonstrate against this infraction of the truce. 
The viceroy received these gentlemen with all the politeness and courtesy which their rank demanded, and replied to them, with much seeming frankness, that he was unquestionably answerable for the conduct of the inhabitants of that part of Brazil under the dominion of Portugal; and if they had broken the truce, he would give the Dutch every satisfaction they could reasonably desire ; but if the Portuguese settled in the Dutch territories had been induced by oppression or any other cause to take up arms, he did not conceive himself amenable for their conduct. Notwithstanding this declaration, it is affirmed that he clandestinely encouraged those who had begun hostilities ; and that even on the present occasion he had secretly prevailed on Captain Hoogstrate, one of the gentlemen charged with this negociation, to deliver up the important post of St. Augustine, of which he was the governor. 
3. Admiral Bonavides arrives with a Jleet. — While this negociation was going forward, General Huys, attacking Colonel Cameron, was defeated with the loss of 100 men. About the same time Admiral Salvador Correa de Bonavides appeared with a formidable fleet on the coast, on which Admiral Lichthart, though he had with him at the time only five men of war, offered him battle. The Portuguese commander, however, declined the combat, alleging that he had no orders to act against the Dutch, but only to land a body of men on his sovereign's dominions. But these troops were no sooner landed than they entered the Dutch territories in a hostile manner, making themselves masters of every place which fell in their way ; on which General Huys was ordered by the council to retreat, but having waited for an officer whom he had dispatched to bring off some valuable effects, and escort a party of ladies to a place of safety, he was surrounded by the Portuguese, who made him and his whole army prisoners.

BRAZIL.  
[Lichthart.— Orders were now dispatched to Admiral Lichthart to attack the Portuguese ships whereever he could find them, and in consequence of these orders he had soon an opportunity of exhibiting a fresh proof of his skill and courage; for with four ships, a frigate, and a bark, he attacked a Portuguese fleet of 17 sail, captured three of the largest ships, together with the admiral, burnt and sunk most of the rest, and killed 700 men. On the news of this victory, the hopes of the council began to revive, when they received information that Hoogstratediad yielded up the post of St. Augustine. This officer, with the price of his treachery, raised a regiment of 650 Brazilians, of whom he was made colonel by the Portuguese, and appearing at their head against his countrymen, behaved with great resolution and fidelity in the service of his new masters. In a short time the Portuguese, owing to the great superiority of their force, made themselves masters of all the strong places in Pernambuco, and at length blocked up the Receiffe, the only remaining stronghold of the Dutch. 
5. Open rupture between Holland and Portugal, — As soon as the news of these transactions reached Holland, the Portuguese ambassador endeavoured to allay the irritation they had produced, by representing that his most faithful Majesty had no concern in them whatever. Notwithstanding these representations, however, the Dutch government fitted out a fleet of 52 men of war, under the command of Admiral Blankert, whom they nominated admiral of Brazil, Guinea, and Angola. He was accompanied on this expedition by Colonels Shuppen and Henderson, who had acquired much celebrity in the service of Count Maurice ; and thus an open rupture commenced between Holland and Portugal. 
The delays and disasters encountered by this fleet on its passage were so great, that it did not arrive at the ReceifFe, till the garrison, reduced to the utmost extremity, was on the point of surrendering. The reinforcements, however, brought by this fleet, enabled the Dutch to protract the war a short time longer, and even to obtain a few trifling advantages. But at the commencement of 1647 the Portuguese again blocked up the Receiffe, where the whole Dutch forces, amounting to only 1800 men, were concentrated. This handful of troops made a gallant defence, but at length sallying out to attack the enemy in the open field, they were overpowered by numbers, and defeated with the loss of 1100 men, most of their officers, and all their artillery and amunition. 
The progress of the Portuguese about this  period became so rapid as to threaten the total ruin of the Dutch affairs in that part of the world; but these misfortunes, instead of stimulating them to greater exertions, produced a national despondency that tended to accelerate the destruction which was become inevitable. The province of Zealand recalled Admiral Blankert, who was accompanied on his return by most of the officers who had served under him ; but similar hardships to those they had experienced in the passage out befel them on their return; so that the admiral as well as several of his officers, died before the fleet arrived in Holland. 
6. Expedition of Admiral Witte Wittezen.— Sieur Shuk, an agent from the governors of Brazil, who came over at the same time, drew such an affecting picture of affairs in that country, as indueed the States to resolve to make a vigorous effort for the preservation of so valuable a settlement. With this view they issued orders for fitting out a fleet of 50 large men of war, and for the embarkation of 6000 troops. The command of this expedition was given to Admiral Witte Wittezen, who was esteemed one of the ablest officers in the Dutch service ; and it was also re*, solved to send after him an additional supply of 5 or 6000 more troops. The admiral sailed to* wards the end of the year 1650; and after encountering very stormy weather on the passage, he at length arrived on the coast of Pernambuco ; but instead of a colony he found only an hospital of sick, maimed, and infirm; and in place of the fortresses he was sent to succour, churchyards filled with the bodies of those brave men who had preceded him, and found their graves in the new world. 
Such being the posture of affairs, the admiral resolved, notwithstanding his orders, to return home without delay ; and this resolution he put immediately into practice, leaving the colony in a worse situation, if possible, than he found it ; for which conduct he was called to account by the States General*, though he found means to justify himself to their satisfaction. In short, illfortune still continued to pursue the Dutch ;- and towards the conclusion of the year 1653, the Portuguese government, who now avowedly assisted Viera,- sent a fleet of 16 large men of war to attack the Receiffe by sea, which so dismayed the garrison that they absolutely refused to fight ; and in the following year the few remaining republicans who had escaped famine and the sword evacuated Brazil, in consequence of a capitulation signed the 28th of January 1654. 
7. Evacuation of the Dutch. — Thus did the}   BRAZIL.  
20?  
£Dutch, by an illjudged parsimony, joined to a number of unfortunate and unforeseen' circumstances, relinquish a conquest which, under a more liberal policy, might have become one of the richest and most flourishing of the European colonies in the new world. The sensation created in the mother country by the news of this untoward event, and the fury with which they demanded justice against General Sigismund Schuppen, who had commanded in chief many years in Brazil, and was governor of the Receifie at the time of its surrender, is perfectly inconceivable. The States, in order to protect him and his officers from the resentment of an enraged populace, found it necessary to send them to prison. In this situation the general earnestly entreated to be suffered to make a public defence ; and in this he recapitulated with so much clearness his own long and faithful services, and the splendid successes he had obtained under the administration of Count Maurice, while at the same time he drew such a faithful picture of the misfortunes and hardships Which he and his brave companions in arms had lately sustained, that the audience dissolved into tears, and his judges honourably acquitted him. 
8. State of Brazil at thai time. — To conclude : when count Maurice, after residing eight years in Brazil, relinquished the government, he left seven captainships, one city, 30 large towns, 45 regular fortresses, 90 sail of ships, 3000 regular troops, 20,000 Dutch, 60,000 Negroes, and" about twice the number of native Brazilians : but, after the expenditure of several millions of money, and the destruction of several thousands of lives, there returned to Holland, in 1655, only between 6 and 700 individuals, and these wholly destitute of property. 
The peace which was a short time before this period concluded between England and the United Provinces, seemed to leave the lalter at liberty to attempt the recovery of this valuable settlement. 
9. Treatt/ of 1661. — But the general expectation, which anticipated this event, was disappointed by the treaty, which put an end to the hostilities between the two powers in 1661, and by which the Brazils were secured to the crown of Portugal, in consideration of 8,000,000 of livres, (333,333/. 6s. 6d.), which that government engaged to pay, either in money or goods, to the United Provinces. 
Since the above period, the Portuguese have remained in quiet possession of this extensive country. The treaty, which delivered them from the presence of an enemy by whom they had been  so often humbled, was no sooner executed, than the court of Lisbon began to consider the best means of securing the future tranquillity, and increasing the riches, of their possessions. 
The Portuguese visited the river Plata shortly after the Spaniards ; but whatever might be their views in this excursion, it does not appear that they endeavoured to form any settlement on it till 1553, at which period they proceeded as far as Buenos Ayres, and took possession of the n. coast of the Spanish provinces in that quarter. This transaction seems to have been overlooked by the Spanish government, till the court of Lisbon proceeded, in 1600, to found the colony of St. Sacrament, at the extremity of the territory hitherto claimed by Spain. Hence arose a new source of jealousy and animosity, which gave rise to the most violent contests between these rival powers, and eventually stained the river Plata with blood. 
10. Variance and reconciliation between the Spanish and Portuguese. — Spain contended that the new colony was planted in the space allotted to her by the Popes, a truth which the Portuguese attempted not to deny, but they maintained that this tract was yielded up to them by later agreements, and particularly by the treaty of 1668. After various acts of hostilities, in which the rising walls of the colony had been destroyed, and the Portuguese expelled, it was agreed, in 1681, that they should be reinstated in possession of the post they had been compelled to abandon, but that the inhabitants of Buenos Ayres should have an equal right with themselves to the enjoyment of the disputed territory. 
This provisional treaty was however abrogated during the war which broke out between the two crowns at the commencement of the last century j in consequence of which, the Portuguese, in 1705, were again expelled from St. Sacrament. It was once more, however, ceded to them by the treaty of Utrecht, as well as the exclusive possession of the whole territory in dispute. 
No sooner had hostilities ceased between these rival crowns, than the inhabitants of St. Sacrament, and those of Buenos Ayres, impelled by their mutual wants and conveniences, entered into a considerable contraband trade with eacli other, in which it appears that all parts of Brazil and of Peru, and even some merchants of the mother countries, were more or less engaged. 
11. Interference of old Spain. — The Spanish government, uneasy at perceiving the treasures of the new world diverted into any other channel, with that shortsighted policy which marked all its councils in respect to its Soutli American posj    208  

BRAZIL.   [sessions, endeavoured as far as possible to limit these unauthorised connections. Asserting that the Portuguese had no right to advance beyond cannonshot from their own walls, orders were given to occupy the n. banks of the Plata, from its mouth to St. Sacrament, with flocks and herds of cattle. The villages of Maldonado and Montevideo were built, and every other measure adopted to secure the possession of this intermediate domain. 
These unexpected and offensive proceedings on the part of Spain quickly revived those feuds and animosities which had been suspended by their commercial intercourse with the Portuguese, and which in a little time would have been wholly forgotten. A clandestine war, to which the people were stimulated by the agents of their respective governments, was carried on for some time, and the two nations were on the brink of an open rupture, when a treaty was proposed, in 1750, that appeared well calculated to terminate the differences between these monarchies. By this treaty the Portuguese agreed to exchange the colony of St. Sacrament, and the territory annexed to it, for the seven missions established by Spain on the e. coast of the Uruguay. Consisiderable opposition was, however, expected to the execution of this treaty in America. "The Jesuits," says the Abbe Raynal, " who from their earliest origin had opened to themselves a secret road to dominion, might have objected to the dismembering of an empire which owed its existence to their labours. Independent of this great interest, they might have thought themselves responsible for the prosperity of a docile set of people, who, by throwing themselves into their arms, had entrusted them with the care of their future welfare. These tribes had not, besides, been conquered, and therefore when they submitted to Spain, they did not give to that crown the right of alienating them from its dominion. Without having reflected on the incontestable rights of nations, they might imagine that it belonged to them alone to determine what was conducive to their happiness. The horror they were well known to entertain for the Portuguese yoke, was equally capable of leading them astray, or of enlightening them." Whatever may be thought of these speculations, whether the above, or whatever other motives operated on the seven ceded provinces, it is certain that they prepared to repel by force the united armies of Spain and Portugal, which had been sent from Europe fo enforce the execution of the treaty. Unfortunately, howtheif military skill and conduct did not  equal their love of independence; for instead of harassing the enemy, aud cutting off tiieir supplies, which they were obliged to procure from a great distance, they imprudently waited for them in the open field. Being defeated in a pitched battle with considerable slaughter, which disconcerted their measures, they abandoned their territory without another effort. 
In consequence of this event, the Spaniards conceived themselves warranted to take possession of the colony of St. Sacrament, which was, however, resisted by the Portuguese, on the pretence that the inhabitants of the Uruguay were only dispersed, and would, in all probability, endeavour to regain a territory from which they had been forcibly expelled. These difficulties retarded the conclusion of the treaty, which was at length finally broken off in 1761. 
12, Treaties of 1777 and 1778.— From that period these deserts once more became the theatre of war and bloodshed, till Portugal, deprived of the assistance of her most powerful allies, was at length forced to submit. By the treaties of 1777 and 1778, she relinquished for ever the colony of St. Sacrament, but received in exchange the territory of the river St. Peter, of which she had been formerly deprived. 
While these enterprises were going forward on the Amazon and the Plata, the more peaceful and industrious citizens on the coast of Brazil were endeavouring to increase the useful productions of the colony, and to give respectability and permanency to her commercial undertakings. 
13. State of commerce, mints y S?c. — — Since the prince regent came to the Brazils, the trade has increased greatly. Before this period it was carried on with Europe in large ships, similar to our East India men ; but it is of course now thrown open to all nations. 
Mr. Humboldt, who takes for his authority the work of Correa de Sena, makes the annual produce of the mines of this kingdom amount to 29,900 Spanish marks of pure gold, the value of which, in dollars, is 4,360,000, at 145/J^ dollars to the Spanish mark. This estimate we strongly suspect to be exaggerated, as 16 years ago Brazil did not furnish 20,000 marks annually, and as many years preceding, the supply from it had been diminishing every year. 
Chap. V. The 14 provinces or captainships have been already enumerated by Alcedo. Each of these pro- Tinces is under the government of a separate com-]   BRAZIL.  [mander ; but though these governors are expected to conform to the general regulations enacted by the viceroy, they are wholly independent of his authority, since they receive their instructions directly from the Portuguese government, and are bound to transmit to Lisbon an account of the business transacted in their several departments. They are only appointed for three years, but their commission is usually extended beyond that period. They are prohibited by law from marrying in the country under their jurisdiction, from being concerned in any branch of trade, from accepting any present whatsoever, from receiving any emoluments for the functions of their office ; and these regulations have been very rigorously adhered to for several years past. Individuals who voluntarily resign their office, or who arc recalled by the government, are obliged to give an account of their conduct to commissioners appointed by the mother country; and the citizens, whatever may be their rank, are competent to impeach them. If they happen to die while in office, the bishop, in conjunction with the commanding officer and the chief magistrate, immediately assume the reins of government till the arrival of a successor. 
The jurisprudence in Brazil is the same as that of the mother country. A judge resides in each district, from whose decision an appeal lies to the superior tribunals of Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, and even to those of Lisbon, if it be a question of great importance. In the districts of Para and M;:r man, they are allowed, however, to appeal directly to the mother country, without being obliged to appear before the two intermediate^tribunals already mentioned. In criminal cases a different practice is followed. The judge belonging to each particular district is empowered to punish petty misdemeanours ; while more enormous offences are judged by the governor, assisted by a certain number of assessors appointed for this purpose. In every province there is also established an especial tribunal, in order to take cognizance of those legacies bequeathed to persons residing bej'ond the seas. They have no fixed salary, but are allowed to deduct five per cent, from such capitals, the remainder being transmitted to Portugal, and deposited in an office appropriated to the purpose. 
The finances of each province are administered by the commandant and four magistrates ; and their accounts are annually forwarded to the royal treasury at Lisbon, where they undergo a most minute inspection. The military establishment is here on the same footing as in Portugal and other European countries. The troops are at the disvol. i,  posal of the governor for the time being, who is entrusted with the nomination of all the officers urtder the rank of captain. The militia is in like manner placed under his controul. It is composed of all the citizens indiscriminately, except the hidalgos, or highest order of nobility, who are exempted from every kind of personal service. This body of men furnish their own uniforms ; in the interior parts of the country they are only assembled in cases of absolute necessity ; but at Pernambuco, Bahia, and other parts on the coast, they are exercised one month every year, during which they receive pay from the government. The Negroes and Mulattoes are embodied by themselves, but the Indians are incorporated along with the colonists. The regular troops generally amount to about 8000 men, and the militia to upwards of 30,000. 
The king, as grandmaster of the order of Christ, has the sole right to the tithes, as well as to the produce of the crusade ; nevertheless, six bishoprics have been established at different times, which are all subordinate to the archbishopric of Bahia, or Todos Santos, founded in 1552. The prelates, who fill those sees, are all of them Europeans, and their salaries, which are paid by the government, vary from 1200 to 30,000 livres (from 50/. to 1250/.) 
None of the inferior clergy are paid by the government, except the missionaries ; but, exclusive of an animal tribute which they receive from every family, they are paid 40 sols (Is. Sd.) for every birth, marriage, and burial ; and in the districts of the mines this emolument is more than doubled. No regular convents are established by law in Brazil ; but in a few of the districts, such as Bahia, and at Rio de Janeiro, some establishments have been endowed for female devotees. There are, however, more than 20 monasteries belonging to different religious orders, the two richest of which are occupied by Benedictine monks. In the gold provinces these institutiqns are prohibited bylaw ; though, while in the plenitude of their power, the Jesuits had sufficient influence to evade this salutary regulation ; but since the period of their expulsion, no other regular orders have been permitted to settle in those regions. 
Though the professed motive for the conquest of this country was that of converting the natives to Christianity, and liberal provision has been made for maintaining friars to preach the gospel to the Indians, yet of late years not one of these fathers have engaged in this dangerous and per- J 
E E  B R A Z I L.   [haps hopeless undertaking. At the period Sir George Staunton visited this country, a few Italian missionaries residing at llio, lie informs us, took some pains to send among the Indians such of their tribe who frequented this city, as they were enabled to gain over to their faith by presents, as well as by persuasion, in order by that means to endeavour to convert the Indians scattered throughout the country. 
No inquisition, or tribunal of the holy office, was ever legally established in the Brazils ; nevertheless the colonists are not wholly independent of the power of that institution. 
In the whole of the Brazils, it is computed that there are at least 600,000 slaves, who have either been born in Africa, or descended from those originally brought from that country. No particular ordinance exists respecting these slaves, though it is generally understood that they ought to be tried by the common law. About 20,000 are annually imported to keep up the number. The average price is about SOL sterling each. Before being shipped from Africa, a duty of 10 rets per head used to be paid to the queen of Portugal's agent in that country, and which in the whole amounted to about 60,000/. a year. This sum went to her own private purse, and was not considered as a part of the public revenue. These illfated beings are clothed and fed by their masters ; and a small portion of ground being allotted to each, which they are allowed two days out of the seven to cultivate for their own emolument, those among them who are laborious are sometimes by this means enabled to purchase their freedom, and which they have a right to demand at a fixed price, whenever they find themselves oppressed. To this circumstance it may perhaps be owing that there are few fugitive Negroes in Brazil, and those few are chiefly to be found in the vicinity of the mines, where they subsist on the productions of the fields. This condition in Brazil is hereditary through the mother, and is not confined to colour, many of them exhibiting every different shade from black to white. Those belonging to the crown are chiefly employed in the diamond mines, and other public works *, several are also attached to the convents. The Benedictines alone have more than 1000 on their different plantations. These fathers are of opinion that the Mulattoes, or the offspring between blacks and whites, are generally endowed with much intelligence and ingenuity. Some of these children they have educated and instructed with much care and success; and one of the friars, with great tri-  umph, mentioned to Sir George Staunton, during his stay in Brazil, that a person of a mixed breed had been lately promoted to a learned professor-, ship at Lisbon. 
Such of the Negroes, as well as the Mulattoes, who have purchased their liberty, enjoy all the rights of citizens, but they are excluded from the priesthood, and from any civil employment under government, nor" can they bold a commission in. the army, except in their own battalions. The colonists seldom or never marry a Negro woman, confining themselves merely to forming with them illicit connections, which are sanctioned by the manners of the country. 
Had the Portuguese, instead of introducing Negro slavery, and all its attendant train of evils, into their new possessions, endeavoured, by a wise and enlightened policy, to conciliate the good will of the natives ; had they endeavoured to overcome their natural indolence, by introducing among them a taste for the conveniences of civilized life; had they, in short, endeavoured to render them, and the colonists but as one people, then would their presence have proved a blessing to one of the finest portions of the globe. But such was the inhumanity and impolicy of these conquerors of the new world, that no sooner had they gained a secure footing in Brazil, than they seized upon the Indians, whom they sold in the public markets, and compelled to work like slaves on the different plantations. 
In 1570, Sebastian prohibited any Brazilian from being subjected to slavery, except those who were taken prisoners in a just war ; but this wise regulation was evaded by the Portuguese, who were too indolent to till the lands themselves, and who had, besides, attached some idea of disgrace to this species of labour ; and at this period a sufficient number of Africans had not been imported to answer the demand for cultivators. 
An edict of Philip II. in 1595, which confirmed the above orders, and likewise reduced the term of slavery, in the case of prisoners, to 10 years, was equally disregarded by the colonists. 
In 1605 and 1609, orders were again sent from Europe, which declared the freedom of the Indians ; and Philip III. having some time after learned that this law had been in a great measure disregarded, issued an edict, by which those who infringed it in future should be subjected to heavy penalties. But as these edicts were not more respected than the former, the missionaries became loud in their complaints respecting the oppression to which the Indian converts were sub-]  [jected. These remonstrances induced the hew court of Lisbon, in 1647, once more to renew their orders against Brazilian slavery. The internal state of the colony, however, and a rising spirit of independence which began to pervade all ranks among the colonists, induced that weak power to compromise their just decrees, and permit those individuals who were born of a Negro mother and an Indian father, to be retained in slavery. Tired at last with the languid labours of the unfortunate natives, the colonists gradually began to supply their place with African slaves, except in a few of the poorer captainships, where they were incapable of purchasing them ; and notwithstanding various edicts of the government, issued during the early part of the last century, this remnant of barbarism continued to prevail in these districts till 1755, at which period the Indians without exception were declared citizens. The same road was opened to them as to their conquerors for the exercise of their talents, and they were suffered to aspire to the highest offices and dignities in the colony. Various circumstances, however, prevented or retarded the good effects which mi&lt;&gt;ht have been expected to result from this political amelioration of their condition ; but the most powerful of these is, perhaps, the want of a free intercourse between them and the Portuguese. Most of the Indians live in separate villages, over which an European presides, who is invested with the power of directing all their concerns, and of punishing or rewarding them according to their deserts. He, in pursuance of the plan that had been laid down by the Jesuits, but certainly with less regard to the spiritual welfare of these poor creatures, superintends the sale of all commodities in behalf of the community, delivers to the government agents the tenth part of the territorial products, and appoints the portion of labour to be performed by those who have fallen into a state of vassalage ; and these agents act under the direction of a chief, to whom is delegated still more extensive authority.

==[[Bridge-Town|BRIDGE-TOWN]]==, a capital city of the island of Barbadoes, one of the Antilles ; situate on the w. coast of the parish of San Miguel, in the interior part of the bay of Carlisle, which is one league in length, and a league and an half in breadth ; capable of containing 500 vessels. The shores in its vicinity lie extremely low, so that they were formerly inundated ; but they are now for the most part, left dry. The city is at the entrance of the valley of St. George; it contains about 1200 houses, built nearly all of brick, and is esteemed the finest city in all the islands : the streets are wide, the houses lofty, and one of the streets has much the appearance of Cheapside in London, the rents being here equally as dear as they are there. It has very convenient wharfs for lading and unlading of merchandize, with some strong forts and castles for their defence; but it is much exposed to hurricanes ; and, as the wind is generally in the e. or n. e. point, thee, part of the city is called the windward. The citadel, or E E 2   2S2  fortress, which bears the name of St. Anne, was an expence of 180,000 dollars ; this has on the e. side a small fort, mounted with eight pieces of cannon, where are preserved, under the care of a good guard, the magazines of the ammunition and provision. The city is garrisoned by 1200 men, who are called the royal regiment of the infantry guards: it is the seat of the governor, the council, assembly, and court of chancery. At the distance of a mile to the n. e. of it the governor has a beautiful house, which was built by the assembly, called Pilgrims, although his ordinary residence is in Fontable : the other forts are to the w. namely St. James's, close to the inlet of Steward, with 18 cannon ; Willoughby, with 20 ; and three batteries, lying between the latter and fort Needham, with 20 cannon. The church is as large as a goodsized cathedral, having a fine organ, a set of bells, and a clock. This city has some good inns and houses of refreshment ; also a postoffice, at which monthly foreign mails have been lately established. Its shops and magazines are filled Avith all kinds of European productions, and it is filled with Englishmen and other foreigners, who come here to merchandize. The air is somewhat damp and unsalutary, owing to the neighbouring lakes:; but, nevertheless, the inhabitants, born here, maintain a vigorous and healthy appearance. [This city was burnt down April 18. 1668. It suffered also greatly by fires on Feb. 8. 1756, May 14. 1766, and Dec. 27. 1767, at whichtimes the greatest part of the town was destroyed : before these fires it had 1500 houses, mostly brick, very elegant, and said to be the finest and largest in all the Charibbee islands : the town lias since been rebuilt. It has a college, founded and liberally endowed by Col. Codrington, the only institution of the kind in the West. Indies ; but it does not appear that its success has answered the designs of the founder. This was the state of the capital of Barbadoes in the summer of 1780. It had scarcely risen from the ashes to which it had been reduced by the dreadful fires already mentioned, when it was torn from its foundations, and the whole country made a scene of desolation, by the storm of the 10th of October 1780, in which above 4000 of the inhabitants miserably perished ; the force of the wind was then so great, as not only to blow down the strongest walls, but even lifted some pieces of cannon off the ramparts, and carried them some yards distance ; and the damage to the country in general was estimated at 1,320,504/. 15s. sterling, and it is scarcely yet restored to its former splendour.

Bridgetown consists of large hills and valleys ; the high land affords red oak, which are often three feet, and sometimes four, in diameter, and 60 or 70 feet without any branches. The valleys are covered with rockmaple, bass, ash, birch, pine, and hemlock. There is a curiosity to be seen in Long pond, which lies mostly in Bridgetown, which may afford matter of speculation to the natural philosopher. On the e. side of the pond is a cove which extends about 100 rods farther e. than the general course of the shore ; the bottom is clay, and so shoal that a man may wade 50 rods into the pond. On the bottom of this cove are stones of various sizes, which it is evident, from various circumstances, have an annual motion towards the shore : the proof of this is the mark or track left behind them, and the bodies of clay driven up before them. Some of these stones are two or three tons weight, and have left a track of several rods behind them ; having, at least, a common cartload of clay before them. The shore of the cove is lined with these stones, which, it would seem, have crawled out of the water. See Sebago Pond.]

[==[[Britain|BRITAIN]]==, New. The country lying round Hudson's bay, or the country of the Esquimaux, comprehending Labrador, New North and South Wales, has obtained the general name of New Britain, and is attached to the government of Lower Canada. A superintendant of trade, appointed by the governorgeneral of the four British provinces, and responsible to him, resides at Labrador. The principal rivers which Water this country are th«  ^Bk     214  

BRITAIN.  on this coast,   [Wager, Monk, Seal, Pockerekesko, Churchill, Nelson, Hayes, New Severn, Albany, and Moose rivers, all which empty into Hudson and James's bay from the w. and s. The mouths of all the rivers are filled with shoals, except Churchill's, in which the largest ships may lie ; but 10 miles higher the channel is obstructed by sand banks. All the rivers, as far as they have been explored, are full of rapids and cataracts, from 10 to 60 feet perpendicular. Down these rivers the Indian traders find a quick passage ; but their return is a labour of many months. Coppermine and M'Kenzie's rivers fall into the N. sea. As far inland as the Hudson's bay company have settlements, which is 600 miles to the w. fort of Churchill, at a place called Hudson's house, lat. 53°. long. 106° 27' w. from London, is flat country : nor is it known how far to the e. the great chain, seen by navigators from the Pacific ocean, branches oft*. From Moose river, or the bottom of the bay, to cape Churchill, the land is flat, marshy, and wooded "with pines, birch, larch, and willows. From cape Churchill to Wager's river the coasts are high and rocky to the very sea, and woodless, except the mouths of Pockerekesko and Seal rivers. The hills on their back are naked, nor are there any trees for a great distance inland. The e. coast is barren, past the efforts of cultivation. The surface is every where uneven, and covered wiih masses of stone of an amazing size. It is a country of fruitless valleys and frightful mountains, some of an astonishing height. The valleys are full of lakes, formed not of springs, but rain and snow, so chilly as to be productive of a few small trout only. The mountains have here and there a blighted shrub, or a little moss. The valleys are full of crooked stinted trees, pines, fir, birch, and cedars, or rather a species of the juniper. In lat. 60°  vegetation ceases.  
The whole shore,' like that on the m is faced with islands at some distance from land. The laudable zeal of the Moravian clergy induced them, in the year 1752, to send missionaries from Greenland to this country. They fixed on Nesbit's harbour for their settlement; but of the first party, some of them were killed, and the others driven away. In 1764, under the protection of the British government, another attempt was made. The missionaries were well received by the Esquimaux, and the mission goes on with success. The knowledge of these n. seas and countries was owing to a project started in England for the discovery of a n. w. passage to China aud the E. Indies, as early as the year 1576 : since then it has been frequently dropped and as often revived, but never yet com-  pleted. Frobisher, about the year 1576, discovered the main of New Britain, or Terra de Labrador, and those straits to which he has given his name. In 1585, John Davis sailed from Portsmouth, and viewed that and the more n. coasts, but he seems never to have entered the bay. Hudson made three voyages on the same adventure, the first in 1607, the second in 1608, and his third and last in 1610. This bold and judicious navigator entered the straits that lead into the bay known by his name, coasted a great part of it, and penetrated to eighty degrees and a half into the heart of the frozen zone. His ardour for the discovery not being abated by the difficulties he struggled with in this empire of winter, and world of frost and snow, he staid here until the ensuing spring, and prepared, in the beginning of 1611, to pursue his discoveries ; but his crew, who suffered equal hardships, without the same spirit to support them, mutinied, seized upon him and seven of those who were most faithful to him, and committed them to the fury of the icy seas in an open boat. Hudson and his companions were either swallowed up by the waves, or, gaining the inhospitable coast, were destroyed by the savages ; but the ship and (he rest of the men returned home. Though the adventurers failed in the original purpose for which they navigated Hudson's bay, yet the project, even in its failure, has been of great advantage to England. The vast countries which surround Hudson's bay abound with animals, whosefur and skins are excellent. In 1670, a charter was granted to the Hudson's bay company,, which does not consist of above nine or ten persons, for the exclusive trade of this bay, and they have acted under it ever since, with great benefit to the individuals who compose the company, though comparatively with little advantage to Britain. The company employ four ships and ISO seamen. They have several forts, viz. Prince of Wales fort, Churchill river, Nelson, New Severn, Albany, on the w. side of the bay, and are garrisoned by 186 men. The French, in May 1782, took and destroyed these forts, and the settlements, &amp;c. said to amount to the value of 500,000/. They export commodities to the value of 16,000/. and carry home returns to the value of 29,340/. which yield to the revenue 3734'. This includes the fishery in Hudson's bay. The only attempt io trade to that part which is called Labrador, has been directed towards the fishery. The annual produce of the fishery amounts to upwards of 49,000/. See Esquimaux and Canada. The whole of the settlements in New Britain, including such as have been mentioned,]   are as follow, which see under their respective heads : Abitibbi, Frederick, East Main and Brunswick houses ; Moose fort ; Henly, Gloucester, and Osnaburg houses ; and a house on Winnipeg lake; Severn, or New Severn; York fort, or Nelson ; Churchill's fort, or Prince of Wales fort ; South Branch, Hudson's, Manchester, and Buckingham houses : the last is the westernmost settlement, and lately erected.] 

[BRITISH America. Under the general name of British America, we comprehend the vast extent of country, bounded s. by the United States of America and the Atlantic ocean ; e. by the same ocean and Davis's straits, which divide it from Greenland ; extending n. to the n. limits of Hudson bay charter, and zo. indefinitely ; lying between lat. 42° 30' and 70° n. ; and long. 50° and 96° w. from Greenwich. British America is divided into four provinces, viz. 1. Upper Canada ; 2. Lower Canada, to which are annexed New Britain, or the country lying round Hudson bay, and the island of Cape Breton, which island, In 1784, was formed into a separate government, by the name of Sydney ; 3. New Brunswick ; 4. Nova Scotia, to which is annexed the island of St. John's. Besides these, there is the island of Newfoundland, which is governed by the admiral for the time being, and two lieutenantgovernors, who reside at Placentia and St. John's. The troops stationed at Newfoundland, however, are subject to the orders of the governorgeneral of the four British provinces. The number of people in the whole of the n. British colonies, is estimated by Morse at about 160,000 or 180,000 ; but has, from the time he wrote, most rapidly increased. Since the four provinces have been put under a general governor, the governor of each is styled lieutenantgovernor. The residence of the general governor is at Quebec. The following informamation, from Edwards's History of the West Indies, respecting the trade and resources of British America, is inserted under this head. The river St. Lawrence remains usually locked up one half of the year ; and although, in 1784, it was confidently said, that the British provinces would be able in three years to supply all the West Indies with lumber and provisions, yet it was found necessary to import lumber and provisions into Nova Scotia from the United States. Thus, in 1790, there were shipped from the United States to Nova Scotia alone, 540,000 staves and heading, 924,980 feet of boards, 285,000 shingles, and 16,000 hoops, 40,000 bbls. of bread and hour, and 80,000 bushels of grain. 
Newfoundland furnished the British West  Indies with 806,459 quintals of fish, on an average of four years ending with 1786. The only provisions exported to Jamaica from Canada, Nova Scotia, and St. John's, between 3d of April 1783, and 26th of October 1784, were 180 bushels of potatoes, and 751 hhds. and about 500 bbls. of salted fish. Of lumber, the quantity was 510,088 feet, 20 bundles of hoops, and 301,324 shingles ; and on an average of five years, from 1768 to 1772, the whole exports to Jamaica from Canada, Nova Scotia, and St. John's, were only 33 bbls. of flour, 7 hhds. of fish, 8 bb!s. of oil, 3 bbls. of tar. pitch, and turpentine, 36,000 shingles and staves^ and 27,235 feet of lumber. From the customhouse returns it appears, that of 1208 cargoes of lumber and provisions imported from North America to the British sugarcolonies in 1772, only seven of those cargoes were from Canada and Nova Scotia ; and that of 701 topsail vessels, and 1681 sloops, which had cleared outwards from North America to theBritish and foreign West Indies, only two of the topsail vessels, and 11 of the sloops, were from these provinces; and it has been proved, that in the years 1779, 1780, 1781, and 1782, the scarcity in Canada had been such as to occasion the export of all bread, wheat, and flour, to be prohibited by authority ; and in 1784, when a parliamentary inquiry took place concerning what supplies the West Indies might expect from Canada and Nova Scotia, a ship in the river Thames was actually loading with flour for Quebec]

The chief towns are St. John's, the capital, Fredericktown, St. Andrew's, and St. Ann, the present seat of government. The principal rivers are St. John's, Magegadavick, or Eastern river, Dickwasset, St. Croix, Merrimichi, Petitcodiac, and Memramcook; all, the three last excepted, empty into Passamaquoddy bay. St. John's river opens a vast extent of fine country, on which are rich intervales arid meadow lands ; most of which are settled and under improvement. The upland is in general well timbered. The trees are pine and spruce ? hemlock and hard wood, principally beech, birch, maple, and some ash. The pines on St. John's river are the largest to be met with in British America, and afford a considerable supply of masts for the royal navy. The rivers which fall into Passamaquoddy bay have intervales and meadows on their banks, and must formerly have been covered with a large growth of timber, as the remains of large trunks are yet to be seen. A raging fire passed through that country, in a very dry season, according to Indian accounts, about 50 years ago, and spread destruction to an immense extent.

BUENAS Costumbr.es, Nuestra Senora ueij, a settlement of the province and government of Tucuman, situate on the shore of the river Salado. 

BUENOS Avres, a province and government of Peru, afterwards erected into a viceroyalty in 1777 ; bounded n. by the province of Paraguay, w. by that of Tucuman and tiie lands of Gran Chaco ; on the s. it extends as far as the straits of Magellan, comprehending a large part of the territory lying w. of the cordillera ; and on the e. by the sea. This province formerly appertained to that of Paraguay, until the year 1621, when it was formed into a separate government, taking the name of the Rio de la Plata ; its -first governor having been Don Diego de Gongora. It was discovered in 1506 by the pilot Juan Diez de Solis. The temperature is for the most part mild, and the soil uncommonly fertile ; producing in abundance wheat, seeds, herbs, and fruits,cspecially peaches, which are extremely delicious. There are such quantities of horned cattle, that their flesh is considered a thing of no value ; and it is customary to kill them merely for their hides, these forming a principal branch of commerce. Horses also are in such quantities as to cost nothing more than the trouble of catching them. There is in this province a great variety of rare animals and exquisitely fine birds : among the former may be reckoned tigers, larger than any found elsewhere in America : the anteater, an animal subsisting entirely npon ants, and which, to get at these insects, is provided with a very long and pointed snout, and the chinchilla, about the size of a lapdog, covered with a wool of a lightgrey colour, and finer than the best silk. This province is, at the present day, very rich and flourishing, for since the galleons have ceased going to Tierra Firme, this has become the port for all the commerce of the several provinces of Peru. This commerce is conducted on land by means of small waggons drawn by oxen ; large companies being formed for the better defending themselves against the attacks of the infidel Indians, who inhabit the extensive llanos or plains called pampas, which are watered by several rivers. All of these rivers are tributary to the river of La Plata, one of the four largest rivers in all America. The capital is the city of La Trinidad de Buenos Ayres, founded on the shore of the river La Plata by Don Pedro de Mendoza. In the year 1535, it was twice abandoned for a time, owing to the invasions of the infidel Indians, the Jarres, and the Charruas, when so   great wasthomisery experienced by {he inhabitants for want of necessary supplies, that they were reduced to the necessity of eating human flesh, was first restored by the licentiate Vaca de Castro, governor of Peru, in the year 1542 ; and a second time in 1581, when it was settled, at the command of Philip II. by Don Juan Ortiz de Zarate, governor of Paraguay, to the jurisdiction of which it then belonged. Its situation is very beautiful, for on the n. side, looking towards the river, there is, to all appearance, a complete sea, without a possibility of discerning the opposite shore, whilst the country around it is delightful, consisting of extensive fields covered with perpetual verdure, and bedecked with an infinite number of country houses and villas, which form an agreeable retreat for the inhabitants. The temperature is healthy, and the air pure : The winter is fresh and healthy, and commences in J une. The rains, which are abundant, are accompanied with such violent storms of lightning and thunder, that nothing but a familiarity with them can allay the terror they are calculated to inspire. The heat of the sun in the summer is moderated by the breezes which rise at midday. It is very fruitful, and abounds in all the productions which convenience or luxury can require. The fruit most common is the peach, the timber of which serves for fuel for the kitchens and ovens, and this article is sometimes brought from a distance of 2 to 300 leagues. Vines were once cultivated here. It is the head of the archbishopric of Charcas, erected in 1620. Its first bishop was D. Fr. Pedro de Carranza, of the Order of the Carmen. It was the residence of the tribunal of the royal audience, founded in 1663; and which having been abolished a short time after, was reestablished in 1783. The buildings, although of brick, may vie with any of Europe. It has a good cathedral church and four parishes, which are, La Concepcion, San Nicolas, Monserrat, and La Piedad ; six convents, two of Franciscans, one of the Observers, and another of the Recolects or Strict Observers, another of St. Dominic, another of La Merced, and a house of entertainment of Bethlemites ; two monasteries of Nuns, one of Capuchins, and the other of St. Catharine ; a house for female orphans, and another for the correction of women ; a college ; and it once had two others, belonging to the Jesuits. It has a beautiful marketplace, which is improved and set off by the houses of the city ; and on the side towards the river is a fort, in which the governor and public officers reside : this is well defended by artillery, and by 24 militia companies of cavalry, each company consisting of 50 men ; also by 9 com-  

BUENOS AY RES.  panies of infantry, of 77 men each. The streets are drawn in a straight line, but are impassable for carts in the wet season : there are battlements or projections on either side of them for the convenience of footpassengers. It may at the present day be looked upon as the first commercial city in all Spanish America. Its inhabitants amount to 3000 housekeepers. It is 70 leagues from the mouth of the river La Plata.

Present state. 
1. General description.— [Bu en os Ayres is one of the most considerable towns in South America, and the only place of traffic to the s. of Brazil. It is in the s, division and province of La Plata, is well fortified, and defended by a numerous artillery. It has an elegant cathedral, a small Indian church, and about 4000 houses. The houses are generally two stories high, some built of chalk, and others of brick ; most of these are tiled. Buenos Ayres has its name on account of the excellence of the air, and is situated on the s. side of the river La Plata, where it is seven leagues broad, 50 leagues from the sea. The ships get to it by sailing up a river that wants depth, is full of islands, shoals, and rocks ; and where storms are more frequent and dreadful than on the ocean. It is necessary to anchor every night at the spot where they come to; and on -the most moderate days a pilot must go to sound the way for the ship. After having reached within three leagues of the city, the ships are obliged to put their goods on board some light vessel, and to go to refit and wait for their cargoes at Icunado de Barragan, situated seven or eight leagues below. Here we meet with the merchants of Europe and Peru ; but no regular fleet comes here, as to the other parts of Spanish America; two, or at most three, register ships, make the whole of their regular intercourse with Europe. The returns are chiefly gold and silver of Chile and Peru, sugar, and hides. Those who have now and then carried on a contraband trade to this city, have found it more advantageous than any other whatever. The benefit of this contraband has been of late wholly in the hands of the Portuguese, who keep magazines for that purpose in such parts of Brazil as lie near this country. The most valuable commodities come here to be exchanged for European goods, such as Vigona wool from Peru, copper from Coquimbo, gold from Chile, and silver from Potosi. From the towns of Corientes and Paraguay, the former 250, the latter  
500 leagues from Buenos Ayres, are brought hither the finest tobacco, sugars, cotton, thread, yellow wax, and cotton cloth ; and from Paraguay, the herb so called, and so highly valued, being a kind of tea drank all over S. America by the better sort ; which one branch is computed to amount to 1,000,000 of pieces of eight annually, all paid in goods, no money being allowed to pass here. Azara asserts, that the wheat here produces 16 for 1, at Monte Video 12, and at Paraquay 4. The Avheat is considerably smaller than that of Spain ; but the bread extremely good. The average quantity produced is 2 19,300 fanegas of Castile, 70,000 of which are consumed in the eountry, and the rest exported to the Havanah, Paraguay, Brazils, and the island of St. Maurice. Bread is, however, by no means the staff of life in this country : meat, and the great variety of roots and other grains with which the country abounds, afford to the poor inhabitants an equally healthy and even more nutritious sustenance. Mendoza, situated at the foot of the Andes of Chile, annually furnishes 3313 barrels of wine, and St. John's 7942 of brandy, to Buenos Ayres and Monte Video ; but the low lands of Peru, particularly the valley of Pisco, possesses the best vine and olive grounds that are to be found in the s. continent. The commerce between Peru and Buenos Ayres is chiefly for cattle and mules, to an immense value. When the English had the advantage of the asiento contract, Negro slaves were brought hither by factors, and sold to the Spaniards. Goods are conveyed in carts over the pampas of Buenos Ayres to Mendoza in one month. From thence they cross over the cordilleras of Chile on mules to San Jago, a distance of 80 leagues, and thence in carts to Valparaiso, 30 leagues, which journey is performed in 15 days. The climate is here healthy, provisions and cattle abundant ; and when the projected road is established through Villarica to the port of Talcahuano in the S. seas, the conveyance will be shortened onethird, and the precarious passage of the cordilleras, which can only be made during the summer months, in consequence of the snows, will be avoided. Buenos Ayres is therefore a good natural deposit for Chile, Peru, and Potosi. 
Buenos Ayres, previous to the war, has afforded 1,000,000 of hides annually, and the meat of 250,000 oxen, sufficing for the consumption of its inhabitants and its exports; the remainder was of consequence lost, for besides the tallow, the tongue was the only part cured. We are gjad to find that the enterprise of some individuals has induced them to salt some of this waste beef, and that the British government, in case of need, may here per-]    B" .Ta  tfb

[ceive the favourable means of supplying their navy, and even the West India islands. 
Paraguay furnishes to the interior trade of Chile 3,750,000 lbs. of Paraguay tea, and 60,000 mules, in exchange for wine and brandies, and 150,000 ponchos, &amp;c. Paraguay also furnishes Buenos Ayres with 4,900,000 lbs. of tea, tobacco, woods, gums, &amp;c. in exchange for European luxuries. It is, however, extremely difficult to establish the precise amount of the interior trade of a country wherein the duties of a/cabala, the only sure means of ascertaining it, are farmed out to individuals, and where the imports and exports are often landed and shipped in a clandestine manner. 
2. Imports and exports. — -At Buenos Ayres, the annual importation of Negroes, from 1792 to 1796, amounted to 1338; and the number has been probably increasing ever since. About 500 are introduced annually into Peru, and about 100 into Mexico. 
The progress of Buenos Ayres and other Spanish settlements on the river Plata, since they were placed under a separate viceroy of their own, has been most unequivocal. The fate of those provinces, for the two preceding centuries, had been singularly hard. Debarred from a free intercourse with Europe, lest the free importation of goods by the river Plata should injure the trade of the galleons, they had no market for their surplus produce, nor means of supplying themselves with foreign commodities, except by vessels occasionally permitted to trade with them under license, or by the contraband commerce which, as before observed, they maintained with the Portuguese. Under the influence of this narrow and oppressive system, they languished in poverty and obscurity till 1778, when, after the erection of Buenos Ayres into the capital of a new viceroyalty, the former restrictions on its commerce were removed. 
The following table, extracted from authentic documents, will show the value of its exports du-  ring the four years preceding the rupture with Ens: land in 1796.

According to Humboldt, the dollars imported into Buenos Ayres, in 1803, amounted to 3,500,000, and the exports consisted of produce to the value of 2,000,000 dollars, besides 5,000,000 dollars in specie. 
3. Coinage. — In the upper provinces of the viceroyalty of Buenos Ayres, are situated many valuable mines of gold and silver, of which the celebrated mine of Potosi is the best known in Europe, though it has long ceased to merit the reputation which it once enjoyed, of being the richest and most abundant mine of the new world. The quantity of the precious metals obtained from these mines, may be estimated by the coinage of the mint of Potosi ; and from the following statements, founded upon the best attainable authorities, it would seem that the amount of their produce has been of late years rapidly increasing.

The succeeding history of this place will be found under the article La Plata : suffice it to observe for the present, that Buenos Ayres is a city, of al! others in America, rising into notice ; and that it is daily the scene of great warfare and disquiet, owing to the separate interests of the old regime, or Spanish government, and of the provincial junta, installed on the 26th August 1808, and, as it is said, amidst the general acclamation of the  inhabitants.

It is situate on the skirt of the Sierra Gorda, on the mountains and in the hollows of which the Pames Indians live retired. These have never embraced the Catholic religion, notwithstanding the endeavours of the religious order of San Francisco. These barbarous infidels, who are increasing in numbers daily, keep this district in a continual state of warfare, having possession of the craggy descents and egresses of the sierra. They are much reduced, and consist only of some hordes and scattered families ; and thus both these, as well as the inhabitants of the capital, amounting to about 760 families of Spaniards, Mulattoes, and Mustees, gain their livelihood by working at the mines, of silver which are found in this district, as well as in the sierra. These mines are not very productive or advantageous, on account of the poverty of the neighbourhood, and the great expence of labour. The town is situate, in the valley of St. Juan, in a small island formed by two rivers, the one called Silla, which descends from the sierra, and the other taking its rise from some springs of Avater, known by the name of Santa Lucia. It has a very good parish church, and convent of San Francisco. Its situation is cheerful, and its soil very fertile. It is supplied with water from the river at some distance by means of a fine aqueduct. Much wheat, maize, .French beans, and pulse, grow in its territory, and it is famous for the breed of mules and horses. Fortyfive leagues n. of Mexico. [Long. 99° 22'.

==[[Cadodaques|CADODAQUES]]==, a small settlement of Indians of Louisiana, situate on the shore of the river Rouge, or Roxo. [These Indians live about 35 miles w. of the main branch of the Red river, on a bayau or creek, called by them Sodo, which is navigable for peroques only within about six miles of their village, and that only in the rainy season. They are distant from Natchitoches about 120 miles, the nearest route by land, and in nearly a n. w. direction. They have lived where they now do only five years. The first year they moved there the smallpox got amongst them, and destroyed nearly one half of them ; it was in the winter season, and they practised plunging into the creek on the first appearance of the eruption, and died in a few hours. Some few years ago they had the measles, of which several more of them died. They formerly lived on the s. bank of the river, by the course of the river 375 miles higher up, at a beautiful praire, which has a clear lake of good water in the middle of it, surrounded by a pleasant and fertile country, which had been the residence of their ancestors from time immemorial. They have a traditionary tale which not only the Caddos, but half a dozen other smaller nations believe in, who claim the honour of being descendants of the same family : they say, when all the world was drowned by a flood that inundated the whole country, the great spirit placed on an eminence, near this lake, one family of Caddoques, who alone were saved ; from that family all the Indians originated. The French, for many years before Louisiana was transferred to Spain, had at this place a fort and some soldiers ; several French families were likewise settled in the vicinity, where they had erected a good flour mill with burr stones brought from France. These French families Continued there till about 25 years ago, when they moved down and settled at Campti, on the Red river, about 20 miles above Natchitoches, where they now live ; and the Indians left it about 14 years ago, on account of a dreadful sickness that visited them.  .va   They settled on the river nearly opposite where they now live, on a low place, but were driven thence on account of its overflowing, occasioned by a mass of timber choking the river at a point below them. The whole number of what they call warriors of the ancient Caddo nation is now reduced to about 100, who are looked upon somewhat like knights of Malta, or some distinguished military order. They are brave, despise danger or death, and boast that they have never shed white man's blood. Besides these, there are of old men and strangers who live among them, nearly  but there are 40 or 50 more This nation has great influence  the same number, women than men. over the Yattassees, Nandakoes,Nabadaches, Inies or Yachies, Nagogdoches, Keychies, Adaize, and Natchitoches, who all speak the Caddo language, look up to them as their fathers, visit and intermarry among them, and joiu them in ail their wars. The Caddoques complain of the Choctaws encroaching upon their country ; call them lazy, thievish, &amp;c. There has been a misunderstanding between them for several years, and small hunting parties kill one another when they meet. The Caddos raise corn, beans, pumpkins, &amp;c. but the land on which they now live is prairie, of a white clay soil, very flat: their crops are subject to injury, either by too wet or too dry a season. They have horses, but few of any other domestic animals, except dogs ; most of them have guns, and some have rifles : they, and all other Indians that we have any knowledge of, are at war with the Osages. The country, generally, round the Caddos is hilly and not very rich : it is weli covered with oak, hickory, and pine, interspersed with prairies, which are, for the most part, very rich, and fit for cultivation. There are here a good number of creeks and springs of fresh water ]

==[[Caicos|CAICOS]]==, the name of a large cluster of islands in the N. sea, situate on the n. of Hispaniola, or St. Domingo. Between them and the island of Maguana, or Mariguana, there is formed a channelcalled the Old Passage, which was navigated by vessels leaving the port of the Havanna for Europe, previous to the discovery of the Bahamas by Anton de Alaminos. This passage was abandoned on account of the navigation through so many small islands, which rendered it hazardous. It is at present frequented solely by small smuggling vessels. Notwithstanding this, it was entered by the whole squadron and convoy of Admiral Sir George Pocock, when he besieged and took the Havanna, in the year 1763. [The Caicos islands, commonly called the Caucases, are a cluster of the Bahama islands, situate upon the edge of one of the Bahama banks. On the n. side of this bank are four ox five islands of considerable extent ; the largest (called the Grand Caicos) is sbove sixty miles long, and two or three broad. It is about 400 miles from New Providence, and due n. from St. Domingo. There are several good reefharbours and anchorages, particularly that at St. George's key, where there is established a port of entry and a small battery. This harbour admits vessels drawing 14 feet water. Besides cotton and other produce which is common to the Bahama islands, some sugar plantations have been attempted in the Caicos, but, owing probably to the want of sufficient rain in that climate, or to the natural sterility of the soil, they have not succeeded. In 1803 there were about 40 white inhabitants upon the Caicos, and nearly 1200 slaves, but many of the latter have been sinceremoved. Previous to May 1803, lands were granted by the crown to the amount of 29,695 acres for the purpose of cultivation. See Bahamas.]

It is one of the most ancient, and from it has been produced the greatest riches ; indeed, it has the prospect of yielding these much longer, in as much as there are supposed to be many veins of this metal as yet undiscovered. The metals are wrought in a mill worked by the water of a stream which rises at four leagues distance; and in order that there may never be a deficiency, the necessary supply of water is let upon the mills by means of locks, from an adjacent lake called Villafro, about &amp; league in circumference. This is necessary only in time of drought, which occurs in the months of August, September, and October. The locks in the rainy season are kept shut, in order that the lake may fill, and be ready to yield its supply upon occasion. This settlement contains two parishes, one of Spaniards, the other of Indians ; besides a church, which they call Del Hospital, since it was supported by the mines when these were in a flourishing state. The soil about the country is very barren, and it can never produce herbage for cattle, being situate between two mountains altogether lacking moisture, and extremely cold. In the church belonging to the Spaniards is reverenced a cross, of an opaque or ashcoloured crystal, extremely perfect, and something exceeding the size of a palm, which, with two others (the one of which, according to tradition, was carried to Spain, and the other lost) were found in a mine on the 2d of May, on the first discovery and taking of the metal, "at the depth of 40 fathom.

It contains 50 families of Indians, who occupy themselves in the cultivation and commerce of cochineal, wheat, maize, fruits, wood, coal, salt, and timber ; and from the revenues arising from these two last articles the city of Oaxaca derives her whole subsistence ; one league s. e. of its capital. 

==[[Calabozo|CALABOZO|Calaboso]]==, a settlement of the province and government of Venezuela, in the kingdom of Tierra Firme ; founded in this century (18th), after the establishment of the company of Guipuzcoa, now the Philippines, on the banks of the river Guarico. [Calabozo is a city of recent date, having been at first an Indian village, which was increased by the Spaniards, who have fixed their residence there, in order to be near at hand to watch and take care of their flocks. The company of Guipuzcoa arrogate to themselves, in CAL their memoirs, the merit of having given to Calabozo that degree of increase which was necessary to its being inscribed on the list of cities. Its temperature is excessively hot, although very regularly moderated by the n. e. breezes. The soil is hardly proper for any thing else but grazing ; and this is the only use they make of it. The pasture is good, and the horned cattle very numerous ; but a sort of banditti are constantly overrunning the immense plains from the jurisdiction of Calabozo as far as the borders of Guarapiche, and steal as many oxen and mules as they can, conveying them in safety to Guayana or Trinity. Often, indeed, do they kill the ox and skin it on the spot, merely taking away the hide and the tallow. It is thought that if prompt and vigorous measures be not taken, the pens distant from the city (as almost all of them are so situate) will be made mere deserts. The city is situate between two rivers, the Guarico to the w. and the Orituco to the e. but much nearer the former than the latter. These two rivers, whose courses are from n. to s. join their waters about four or five leagues above Calaboso ; then, at a distance of about 20 leagues, fall into the Apure, and increase under this name the Orinoco. When the rains force these two rivers from their beds, which happens every year, the inhabitants find themselves extremely distressed. Their travelling, their work, and every thing else, is suspended. The cattle retire to the heights until the waters quit the plains, and allow them to return to their pasturage. The streets and houses form an agreeable prospect ; and the church, without being very handsome, is decent. In 1786, there were in Calabozo, and the five villages that belong to it, 549 houses, 1680 white people, 1186 free Indians, not tributary, 3301 persons of colour, 943 slaves, 116 country houses and pens, 1872 mules, and 26,557 oxen and cows. In 1804, the population of the city amounted to 4800 people*. It is situate in lat. 8° 54', at 52 leagues s. of Caracas, and nearly as many n. of the Orinoco.] Calabozo, another settlement of the province and government of Santa Marta, in the district of the Rio del Hacha, situate on the seacoast.

CALCA and Lares, a province and corregimiento of Peru ; bounded s. by Quispicanchi, e. by Paucartambo, s. w. by the jurisdiction of Cuzco, from whence it lies four leagues ; by Abancai ; its limits being a long chain of snowclad mountains ; and n. e. and n. by the cordillera of the Andes, and mountains of the infidel Indians.. The whole of this province is a broken uneven territory, 30 leagues in length from n. to s. and from two to five in width. Its temperature is mild, excepting in the heights of either side, where it is very cold. Its productions are those of a warm and cold climate, namely, wheat, maize, and other grain in abundance, a variety of fruits, papas, and many sweetsmelling flowers. Its breed of cattle is very considerable. On the e. it intersects the cordillera bytwo extensive valleys,, called Quiliobamba and Amaibamba,.of a warm and moist temperature, very fertile, and in which there are many plantations of canes, from which is made the best sugar in the whole kingdom. There is also in the n. e. part a pass through the cordillera by the valleys of Ocabamba and Lares, abounding in wild fruits, wood, animals, and insects. The fertility of this province is so great, that the sugarcanes being once planted, perpetuate themselves for several years, and become ripe in 14 months ; their first produce being extremely fine. There are at present no mines worked, although formerly much silver was procured from those which are now abandoned, either on account of their having filled with water, or from the baseness of the metal produced. There are some indeed of saltpetre, which is carried to Cuzco for the manufacture of gunpowder. The principal river which waters it is the Vilcomayo, which runs through the broken ravine or vallev, and has thrown across it in various parts bridges formed of wickerwork. The number of its inhabitants is 10,000 ; its reparthniento used to amount to 63,300 dollars, and it paid yearly 508 dollars for alcabala.

It is very populous, fertile, and abounding in mines, vegetable productions, and cattle, which is a great artic'e of commerce : It is of warm temperature ; its natives are esteemed the most skilful and ingenious in the province, and its Indians were of so warlike a nature, that they never would perhaps have been brought into subjection, but for the persuasions of the venerable Fr, Augustin of Coriula, bishop of Popayan, It is the native place of Father Diego Caizcdo, a singular missionary, and a man of extraordinary virtues; alsoof Father Miguel of Silva, a. missionary in the province of Mainas ; both of the abolished society of the Jesuits.

==[[Calidonia|CALIDONIA]]==, a capacious, convenient, and secure port of the province of Darien, and kingdom of Tierra Firme, on the coast of the N. sea. Here the Scotch founded a colony and establishment, but were dislodged by order of the king, by the Colonel Don Juan Diaz Pimienta, governor of Cartagena, in the year 1699. The ruins are yet to be seen of the above colony \ as also of a castle. The French afterwards established themselves here in 1764, but were put to death by the Indians, who immediately admitted the English, who possess a small compact settlement, called New Edinburgh. In an uneven ground towards the s. there grows a small plant of two long narrow leaves, each of them of a distinct green colour. When taken together, they produce no effect ; but being separated, that of the lighter colour is a most active and efficacious poison, and produces instant death, though the other is always an antidote. Of this herb the Indians make use, applying the fatal secret to their purposes of vengeance. 
==[[California|CALIFORNIA]]==, Old, isan extensive peninsula of N.America, lying between the tropic of Cancer and the 33° n. lat"; washed on the e. by a gulf of the same name, and on the w. by the Pacific ocean, or great S. sea ; lying within the three capes or limits of cape St. Lucas, the river Colorado and cape Blanco de San Sebastian, which is called its ■w. limit. The gulf which washes it on the e. called the gulf of California, is an arm of the Pacific ocean, intercepted between cape Corrientes .on the one side, and cape St. Lucas on the other ; that is, between Mexico or New Spain on the n. e. and that of California on the w. It is nearly 300 leagues in length from the cape of San Lucas to the last reduced territory towards the n. Its width is various, for, being at the aforementioned extremity, 10 leagues, it continues increasing to 20, SO, and 40 leagues from one sea to the other. The climate is various, according to the different heights of.the land ; but for the most part it is excessively hot. The ground is uneven, rough, and barren, full of ridges of mountains, stony and sandy places; lacking moisture, but abounding in mules, horses, and neat cattle, and all sorts of swine, goats, and sheep, which have multiplied in the same proportion as the dogs and cats introduced by the Spaniards. There is found in the woods a kind of animal, which, in the language of the country, is called tat/e } about the size of a calf of a year and an half  old, and very much resembling one; its head and skin being like to those of a deer, its horns very' thick, and similar to those of a ram : its hoof is large, round, and cleft like that of an ox ; the tail is small, and the flesh is well tasted and delicate. There is also another animal here very like a sheep, although somewhat larger ; of these there are blacky and white, bearing quantities of wool very easy to" be spun, and their flesh is very delicate. Here are also found deer, hares, rabbits, berrendos, and coyotes, a species of fox, and called by this name in. Nueva Espana. Sometimes leopards have been seen here, and a few years since some Indians killed a wolf, an animal which had never before been known in these parts. In the serrar/ia, or mountainous parts, there are wild hogs, cats, tigers, and a species of beaver. This country abounds in reptiles, as vipers, snakes of different sorts, scorpions, spiders, ants, lizards, and tarantulas ; but it is free from bugs, fleas, and niguas. Of birds, it produces turtledoves, herons, quails, pheasants, partridges, geese, ducks, wild ducks, ringdoves, and some birds of prey, as sparrowhawks, vultures, falcons, horned owls, eagles, and also jackdaws, those too which they call zopilotes in IN ueva Espana, and others which they call auras, (or West Indian crows), screechowls, and different birds not known in any other parts. This country is extremely barren of wood ; and only towards the cape of Sanducas, where the country is most level, fertile, and temperate, are there any trees to be found. Here, however, we have that peculiar tree called the pitajaia, the branches of which are fluted, and grow up straight from its trunk, bearing no leaf; on the same branch hangs the fruit, having the rind covered with prickles ; so that it appears to some to be a species of thetrinau (thistle plant), although the fruit is whiter and more delicate : some produce fruit of a reddish, and some of a yellow tint, which is extremely well flavoured, and is either sweet, or a little acidulous ; the same is esteemed an excellent medicine in the venereal disease. From the fruit trees aromatic gums are gathered in such abundance that they are mixed with grease for careening the bottoms of ships ; and from the crude root of the mezcales they compose the drink so called. They have a sort of. aloes, from strips of which they make nets ; and from other herbs, in a manner which is truly curious, they manufacture bowls and cruets to eat and drink out of. The Indians who inhabit the river Colorado, fabricate from the same herbs troughs or trays, which they call coritas, so large as to contain two hundred weight of maize. In them they carry by water fruits and different articles from one  
CALIFORNIA.  shore to another. They have besides the alimentary herb called yi/cas, the Spanish potatoe, and the gicamas. — This country produces also olives, rigs, vines, wheat, maize, Frenchbeans, water melons, melons, gourds, chickpeas, and all kinds of garden herbs, for which it is indebted to the Jesuits, who first planted them here. No mines have been discovered here ; but there are sufficient indications of the existence of every sort of metal. The quantity of fish and shell fish found on its coasts is incredible ; it is of every description, and among others, the profusion of pilchards is most astonishing ; these being at certain seasons left in shoals dry upon the beach. \V hales are also found here, and on the exterior coast shells of the most beautiful lustre may be collected ; some of these being more brilliant than the finest mother of pearl, and covered with a blue similar to that of the most delicate lapis lazuli. Nor are pearls themselves to be found in less abundance. It is true that the Indian formerly used to throw the shell bearing this precious treasure into the fire, in order that he might extract the oyster for his food ; but now, it appears, he has learned to hold it in due estimation, instructed by the Europeans. The pearl fisheries in these parts are much favoured by the shallowness of the water. This country was discovered in the year 1 526 by the celebreted Hernan Cortes, as he was endeavouring to find a passage from the N. to the S. sea. Its conquest from that time had often been attempted, but without effect, until the year 1679, when, pursuant to the king's direction, it was invaded by Admiral Don Isidro Otondo, and was settled by the missionaries of the extinguished order of the Jesuits, under the direction of the Father Eusebio Francisco Kino, who first began to bring the infidel Indians under subjection. Many changes and conquests have since taken place here, under different officers appointed on the several occasions ; the relation of which would however, perhaps unnecessarily, dilate this article beyond its proper limits. [The peninsula of Old California, which equals England in extent of territory, and does not contain the population of the small towns of Ipswich or Deptford, lies under the same parallel with Bengal and the Canary islands. The sky is constantly serene and of a deep blue, and without a cloud ; and should any clouds appear for a moment at the setting of the sun, they display the most beautiful shades of violet, purple, and green. All those who had ever been in Old California, preserved the recollection of the extraordinary beauty of this phenomenon, which depends on a particular state of the vesicular vapour and the purity of the air in these climates. No where could an astrono-  mer find a more delightful abode than at Cumana, Coro, the island of Margerita, and California. But unfortunately in this peninsula the sky is more beautiful than the earth. The soil is sandy and arid, like the shores of Provence ; vegetation is at a stand ; and rain is very un frequent. A chain of mountains runs through the centre of the peninsula, of which the most elevated, the Cerro de la Giganta, is from 1400 to metres (from 4592 to 4920 feet) in height, and appears of volcanic origin. This Cordillera is inhabited by animals, the most peculiar of which have been already enumerated. At the foot of the mountains of California we discover only sand, or a stony stratum, on which cylindrical cacti (organos del tunal) shoot up to extraordinary heights. We find few springs ; and through a particular fatality, it is remarked that the rock is naked where the water springs up, while there is no water where the rock is covered with vegetable earth. Whereever springs and earth happen to be together, the fertility of the soil is immense. It was in these points, of which the number is far from great the Jesuits established their first missions, maize, the jatropha, and the dioscorea vigorously ; and the vine yields an excellent grape, of which the wine resembles that of the Canary  islands.  
In general, however,  account of the arid nature of the soil, of water and vegetable earth in the interior of the country, will never be able to maintain a great population any more than the n. part of Sonora, which is almost equally dry and sandy. Of all the natural productions of California the pearls have, since the 16th century, been the chief attraction to navigators for visiting the coast of this desert country. They abound particularly in the 5. part of the peninsula. Since the cessation of the pearl fishery near the island of Margerita, opposite the coast of Araya, the gulfs of Panama and California are the only quarters in the Spanish colonies which supply pearls for the commerce of Europe. Those of California are of a very beautiful water and large ; but they are frequently of an irregular figure, disagreeable to the eye. The shell which produces the pearl is particularly to be found in the bay of Ceralvo, and round the islands of Santa Cruz and San Jose. The most valuable pearls in the possession of the court of Spain were found in 1615 and 1665, in the expeditions of Juan Yturbi and Bernal de Pinadero. During the stay of the Visitador Galvez in California, in 1768 and 1769, a private soldier in the presidio of Loreto, Juan Ocio, was made rich in a short time by pearl fishing on the coast of Ceralvo. Since that period]   Old California

CALIFORNIA.  the numbers of pearls of California brought annually to market is almost reduced 1o nothing. The Indians and Negroes, who follow the severe occupation of divers, are so poorly paid by the whites, that the fishery is considered as abandoned. This branch of industry languishes from the same causes which in "South America have raised the price of the Peruvian sheepskins, the caoutchouc, and the febrifugal bark of tlie quinquina. In California the Jesuits obtained a complete victory over the soldiery posted in the presidios. The covirt decided by a cedilla real, that all the detachment of Loreto, feven the captain, should be under the command of the father at the head of the missions. The interesting voyages of three Jesuits, Eusebius Kiihn, Maria Sal vatierra, and Juan Uguarle, brought us acquainted with the physical situation of the country. The village of Loreto had been already founded, under the name of Presidio de San Dionisio, in 1697. Under the reign of Philip V. especially after the year 1744, the Spanish establishments in Californa became very considerable. The -Jesuits displayed there that commercial industry and that activity to which they are indebted for so ■many successes, and which have exposed them to so many calumnies in both indies. In a very few years they built 16 villages in the interior of the peninsula. Since their expulsion in 1767, California has been confided to the Dominican monks of the city of Mexico ; and it appears that they have not been so successful in their establishments of Old California, as the Franciscans have been on the coasts of New California. The natives of the peninsula who do not live in the missions, are of all savages, perhaps, the nearest to what has been called the state of nature. They pass whole days stretched out on their bellies on the sand&gt; when it is heated by the reverberation of the solar rays. Like several tribes of the Orinoco, they entertain a great horror for clothing. " A monkey dressed up does not appear so ridiculous to the common people in Europe," says Father Venegas, " as a man in clothes appears to the Indians of California." Notwithstanding this state of apparent stupidity, the first missionaries distinguished different religious sects among the natives. Three divinities, who carried on a war of extermination against each other, were objects of terror among three of the tribes of California. The Pericues dreaded the power of Niparaya, and the Menquis and the Vehities the power of Wactipuran and Sumongo. According to the information obtained from the monks who now govern the two Californias, the population of Old California has diminished to such a •degree within the last thirty years, that there are not  more than from 4 to 5000 native cultivators (Tndios reducidos) in the villages of the missions. The number of these missions is also reduced to 16. The savages amount to only 4000, and it is observed that those inhabiting the n. of California are somewhat more gentle and civilized than the natives of the s. division. The principal villages of this province are Loreto, Santa Ana, and San (Nuem California). If is a long and narrow ex- Joseph. 
The part of the coast of the great ocean which extends from the isthmus of Old California, or from the bay of Todos los Santos (s. from the port of San Diego) to cape Mendocino, bears on the Spanish maps the name of New California tent of country, in which for these 40 years the Mexican government has been establishing mis* sions and military posts. No village or farm is to be found n. of the port of St. Francis, which is more than 78 leagues distant from cape Mendocino. The province of New California in its present state is only 197 leagues in length, and from nine to ten in breadth. The city of Mexico is the same distance in a straight line from Philadelphia as from Monterey, which is the chief place of the missions of New California, and of which the latitude is the same within a few minutes with that of Cadiz. At the time of the expedition of M. Galvez, military detachments came from Loreto to the port of San Diego. The letter -post still goes from this port along the n. w. coast to San Francisco. This last establishment, the most n. of all the Spanish possessions of the new continent, is almost under the same parallel with the small town of Taos in New Mexico. It is not more than 300 leagues distant from it ; and though Father Escalante, in his apostolical excursions in 1777, advanced along the u&gt;. bank of the river Zaguananas towards the mountains De los Guacaros, no traveller has yet come from New Mexico to the coast of New California. 
From the example of the English maps, several geographers give the name of New Albion to New California. This denomination is founded on the inaccurate opinion of the navigator Drake, who first discovered, in 1578, the n, w. coast of America between the 38° and the 48° of latitude. The celebrated voyage of Sebastian Viscaino is no doubt 24 years posterior to the discoveries of Francis Drake ; but Knox and other historians seem to forget that Cabrillo had already examined, in 1542, the coast of New California tothe parallel of 43°, the boundary of his navigation, as we may see from a comparison of the old observations of latitude with those taken in our own days. Al-T

CALIFORNIA.  
[though the whole shore of New California was carefully examined by the great navigator Sebastian Viscaino, (as is proved by plans drawn up by himself in 1602), this fine country was only, however, occupied by the Spaniards 167 years afterwards. The court of Madrid dreading lest the other maritime powers of Europe should form settlements on the n. w. coast of America, which might become dangerous to the Spanish colonies, gave orders to the Chevalier de Croix, the viceroy, and the Visitador Galvez, to found missions and presidios in the ports of San Diego and Monterey. Fortius purpose two packetboats set out from the port of San Bias, and anchored at San Diego in the month of April 1763. 
The soil of New California is as well watered and fertile as that of 0!d California is arid and stonv. It is one of the most picturesque countries which can be seen. The climate is much more - mild there than in the same latitude on the e. coast of the new continent. The sky is foggy, but the frequent, fogs, which render it difficult to land on the coast of- Monterey and San Francisco,, give vigour to vegetation and fertilize the soil, which is covered with a black and spongy earth. In the 18 missions which now exist in New California, wheat, maize, and haricots (frisotes), are cultivated in abundance. Barley, beans, lentiles, and garbanzos, grow very well in the fields in the greatest part of the province. Good wine is made in the villages of San Diego, San Juan Capistrano, San Gabriel, San Buenaventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Santa Clara, and San Jose, and all alongthe coast, s. and n. of Monterey, to beyond the 37° of latitude. The European olive is successfully cultivated near the canal of Santa Barbara, especially near San Diego, where an oil is made as good as that of the valley of Mexico, or the oils of Andalucia. 
The population of New California, including only the Indians attached to the soil who have begun to cultivate their fields, was in 1790, - - 7,748 souls in 1801, - - 13,668 and in I8U2, - - I5,'&gt;62 
Thus the number of inhabitants has doubled in rests,) furnishes also the most convincing proofs of the increase of industry and prosperity of New California. In 1791, according to the tables published by M. Galiano, the Indians sowed in the whole province only 874 bushels of wheat, which yielded a harvest of 15,197 bushels. The cultivation doubled in 1802; for the quantity of wheat sown was 2089 bushels, and the harvest 33,576 bushels. 
The following table contains the number of live stock in 1802.

67,782 107,172 1040 2187 In 1791 there were only 24,958 head' of black cattle (ganado mayor) in the whole of the Indian villages. The n. part of California is inhabited by the two nations of the Rumsen and Escelen. They speak languages totally different from one another, and they form the population of the presidio and the village of Monterey. In the bay of San Francisco the languages of the different tribes of the Matalans, Salsen, and Quirotes, are derived from* a common root. Father Lasuen observed, that on an extent of 180 leagues of the coast of California, from San Diego to San Francisco, no fewer than 17 languages are spoken, which can hardly be considered as dialects of a small number of mother fornia would  languages.  
The population of New Calihave augmented still more rapidly if the laws by which the Spanish presidios have been governed for ages were not directly ooposite to the true interests of both mothercountry and colonies. By these laws the soldiers stationed at Monterey are not permitted to live out of their barracks and to settle as colonists. The Indians who inhabit the villages of New California have been for some years employed in spinning coarse woollen stuffs, called frisadas ; but their principal occupation, of which the produce might become a very considerable branch of commerce, is the dressing of stagskins. In the cordillera of small elevation which runs along the coast, as well as in the neighbouring savannas, there are neither buffalos nor elks ; and on the crest of the mountains which are covered with snow in the month of November, the berrendos, with small chamois years. Since the foundation of these missions, horns, feed by themselves. But all the forest and or between 1769 and 1802, there were in all, ac-  
1769 ant cording to the parish registers, 33,7 17 baptisms, 8009 marriages, and 16,984 deaths. We must not attempt to deduce from these data the proportion between the births and deaths, because in the number of baptisms the adult Indians (los neqplos) are confounded with the children. The estimation of the produce of the soil, or the har-  allthe plains covered with gramina, are filled with flocks of stags of a most gigantic size, the horns of which are round and extremely large. Forty or fifty of them are frequently seen at a time : they are of a brown colour, smooth, and without spot. Their horns, which are not palmated, are nearly 15 decimetres (4^ feet) in length. It is affirmed by every traveller, that this great stag of New Ca-~j    C A L   being n. w.  
[lifornia is one of the most beautiful animals of Spanish America. It probably differs from the wewakish of M. Hearne, or the elk of the United States, of which naturalists have very improperly made the two species of cervus Canadensis and cervus Strongyloceros. The horns of these stags are said to be nine feet long, and the animal, when running, throws up its head to rest them on its back. 
The Spanish and Russian establishments hitherto the only ones" which exist on the coast of America, it may not be useless here to enumerate all the missions of New California which have been founded up to 1803. This detail is more interesting at this period than ever, as the United States have shown a desire to advance .towards the w. towards the shores of the great ocean, which, opposite to China, abounds with beautiful furs of sea otters. 
The missions of New California run from s. to n. in the order here indicated : 
San Diego, a village founded in 1769, 15 leagues distant from the most n. mission of Old California. Population in 1802, 1560. 
San Luis Rey de Francia, a village founded in 1798, 600.

Santa Cruz, a village founded in 1794, 440. 
Santa Clara, a village founded in 1777, 1300. 
San Jose, a village founded in 1797, 630. 
San Francisco, a village founded in 1776, with a fine port. This port is frequently confounded by eeographers with the port of Drake further n. under the 38° 10' of latitude, called by the Spaniards the Puerto de Bodega. Population of San Francisco, 820.  The number of whites, Muslees, and Mulattoes, who live in New California, either in the presidios t or in the service of the monks of St. Francis, may be about 1300 ; for in the two years of 1801 and 1802, there were in the cast of whites and mixed blood 35 marriages, 182 baptisms, and 82 deaths. It is only on this part of the population that the government can reckon for the defence of the coast, in case of any military attack by the maritime powers of Europe. The population of the intendancy of New California was, in 1803, 15,600. The extent of surface in square leagues 2125, the inhabitants being seven to each league.]

==[[Callao|CALLAO]]==, a Peruvian city and port of the S. sea, much frequented, and carrying on a great commerce with the other provinces of America, and with Europe. It gained the title of city in the year 1671. It was well fortified when the Dutch commander Jacques THermite laid siege to it for the space of five months, in the year 1624 ; and here, it is said, that owing to his failure in this enterprise, he died of vexation. [On the n. side runs the river which waters Lima, on which side is a small suburb built only of reeds. There is another on the s. side ; they are both called Pitipisti, and inhabited by Indians. To the e. are extensive plains, adorned with beautiful orchards watered by canals cut from the river. The town, which is built on a low flat point of land, was strongly fortified in the reign of Philip IV.; and numerous batteries command the port and road,   CAL which is the greatest, finest, and safest in all the S. sea. There is anchorage every where in very deep water, without danger of rocks or shoals^ except one, which is three cables length from the shore, about the middle of the island of St. Lawrence, opposite La Galatea. The little island of Callao lies just before the town. In the opening between these two islands, there are two small islets, or rather rocks; there is also a third very low, but half a league out at sea, s. s. e. from the n. w. point of the island of St. Lawrence. Near the seaside is the governor's house, which, with the viceroy's palace, take up two sides of a square ; the parish church makes a third ; and a battery of three pieces of cannon forms the fourth. The churches are built of canes interwoven, and covered with clay, or painted white. Here are five monasteries, and an hospital. The houses are in general built of slight materials; the singular circumstance of its never raining in this country renders stone houses unnecessary ; and besides, these are more apt to suffer from earthquakes, which are frequent here. The most remarkable happened in the year 1746, which laid |ths of Lima level with the ground, and entirely demolished Callao ; where the destruction was so entire, that only one man, of 3000 inhabitants, was left to record this dreadful calamity.

==[[Calota|CALOTA]]==, a city of the province and government of Popajan, founded in the plaee catled De la Quebrada, on the shore of the river Magdalena, and near its source, by Juan Moreno, in the year 1543. It is of a warm and moist temperature, abounding in gold mines, but very subject to tempests, in which thunderbolts are observed to fall frequently and in great numbers. The Paces Indians, the inhabitants, in conjunction with the Pigaos, destroyed it, putting to death the curate, in the year 1641; and being deeply incensed against the bell of the church, because it used to call them to mass, and to their instruction in religion, they endeavoured, by various means, to break it to pieces, which they were not able to effect till they rolled it down" from the top of a mountain into a stony valley ; from which time, as fame will have it, this bell is heard to sound here whenever a tempest rises, and as often as it is a k    C A L  heard the tempest immediately subsides. Again, when it was resolved to rebuild the city at a small distance, they collected the pieces of this bell, and from some of them formed another bell, reserving the remaining pieces as a kind of precious relic or specific against tempests, keeping them shut up in a box to which there are two keys, one of which is kept by the curate, and the other by the bishop of Popayan, who distribute bits of this bell, in order that they may be wrought up in the tongues of other small bells ; and indeed, so much are they esteemed, and so common have they become, that there is not a house in the kingdom but has in it this relic, as a specific antidote against tempests.

==[[Camana|CAMANA]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru ; bounded n. w. and n. by the province of lea, n. e. by that of Lucanas, e. by that of Parinacochas and Condesuios, s. e. by that of Collahuas, and w. by the S. sea. It extends in length 25 leagues, from the n.w. to the s. e. extremities, and in its widest part from e. to w. it is 14 leagues. It is composed of many valleys, which for the most part terminate on the coast, and are thus called, viz. Mages, Camana, Quilca, Ocona, Atico, Chaparra, Chala, Yauca, and Acari. To the s. and before the valley of Mages, there lies a valley of the name of Sihuas, which is 10 leagues in length. The five valleys towards the s. belong to the temporal jurisdiction of this province ; but inasmuch as relates to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, appertain to the province of Collahuas. All these valleys abound in pimento, vines, of which they make wine and brandy ; with figs and seeds, particularly in Mages ; with these productions a large commerce is carried on with the neighbouring provinces. The temperature here is similar to that of Lima. Towards the sierra, rain is not unfrequent, and in that part are many mines of gold, which, however, owing to the hardness of the metals, the immense expences of working, and the great mixture of alloy, render but little profit. Here are also mines of copper, and upon a very lofty mountain called Huantiapa, are mines of crystal of various colours. All these valleys are irrigated by rivulets running down from the sierra; and many of these swell prodigiously in the rainy months, which are January, February, and March. The rest of the year these valleys suffer much from drought, with the exception of those of Mages and Ocona, which are always well watered with streams abounding in kingfish, lisas, and prawns. In the former valley, in particular, is found an animal much resembling a cat, which lives upon these kingfish. This province is poor, and its inhabitants are a wretched race, dispersed over many valleys, and living upon dried figs instead of bread. There are various creeks upon the coast, in which fish are caught in considerable quantities, and carried to be sold in the sierra. There are also some small islands where they go to collect huanco y which is the dung of a certain bird, and used for manuring  the valleys. The repartimiento in this province formerly amounted to 52,600 dollars, and it paid yearly 420 for alcavala. Its population is contained in 14 settlements, which are, Quilca, Valle de Chaparra, 
Aplao, Tocotay, 
Huancarqui, Atiquipa, 
Ocona, Acari, 
Caraveli, Yucata, 
Valle de Atico, Yauca, 
Chala, Yaqui. 
Camana, the capital of the above province, is situate two leagues from the sea, on a beautiful and delightful spot. It is watered by the Mages, just before this river enters the sea, where it takes its course round a most charming grove tenanted by a variety of birds. The population was formerly large, but at present its inhabitants scarcely amount to the number of 1500 souls, owing to the greater part of them having emigrated to Arequipa. There is a small bay on the coast, of the same name, where quantities of fish are caught. [Lat. 16° 17' s.']

Its university contained, previous to the reign of Queen Anne, more than 4000 choice books. The college consists of a president, five collegiates, and one treasurer. There was likewise a college for the Indians ; but not being made use of for this purpose, it was converted into a printing office. [Cambridge is one of the largest and most respectable townships of the county. Its three parishes, Cambridge, Little Cambridge, and Menotomy, contain three Congregational meetinghouses, one for Baptists, and another for Episcopalians, a number of very pleasant seats, and 2 1 15 inhabitants.

[Campbell's Fort, in the state of Tennessee, stands near the junction of Holston river with the Tennessee ; distant 135 miles from Abingdon in Washington county, Virginia, and 445 w. of Richmond in Virginia.] 
[Campbell's Salines, in North Holston, in the state of Tennessee, are the only ones that have yet been discovered on the upper branches of the Tennessee, though great search has been made for them. Large bones, like those found at Big Bone lick, have been dug up here ; and other circumstances render the tract which contains the salines a great natural curiosity. Captain Charles Campbell, one of the first explorers of the w. country, made the discovery of this tract in 1745. In 1753 he obtained a patent for it from the governor of Virginia. His son, the late General William Campbell, the same who behaved so gallantly in the years 1780 and 1781, became owner of it on his death. But it was not till the time of his death, when salt was very scarce and dear, that salt water was discovered, and salt made by a poor man. Since that time it has been improved to a considerable extent, and many thousands of people are now supplied from it with salt of a superior quality, and at a low price. The tract consists' of about 300 acres of salt marsh land, of as rich a soil as can be imagined. In this flat, pits are sunk, in order to obtain the salt water. The best is found from 30 to 40 feet deep; after passing through the rich soil or mud, from six to 10 feet, you come to a very brittle limestone rock, with cracks or chasms, through which the saltwater issues into the pits, whence it is drawn by buckets and put into the boilers, which are placed in furnaces adjoining the pits. The hills that surround this flat are covered   CAM with fine timber ; and a coal mine has been disco* vered not far from it.] 

==[[Campeche|CAMPECHE]]==, San Francisco de, a town of the province and government of Yucatan in the kingdom of Guatemala, founded by the Captain Francisco de Montejo, in the year 1540. It was originally on the bank of a river, where at present stands the settlement of Tenozic. It was afterwards removed to the river Potonchan, more properly called Champoton ; and, lastly, it changed its situation to the banks of the river San Francisco, being notable for the convenience of its port, which is one of the most frequented, and receiving more merchandize than any other in the same gulf. The city is small, defended by three towers, called La Tuerza, San Roman, and San Francisco ; and these are well provided with artillery. It has, besides, a parish church, a convent of the order of San Francisco, another of San Juan de Dios, in which is the hospital bearing the title of Nuestra Sefiora de los Remedios ; and, outside of the city, another temple dedicated to St. Roman ; to whom particular devotions are paid, and who is a patron saint. In this temple there is held in reverence an image of our Saviour, with the same title of San Roman, which, according to a wonderful tradition, began, previous to its being placed here, to effect great miracles ; accordingly, it is said, that a certain merchant, named Juan Cano, being commissioned to buy it in Nueva Espana, in the year 1665, brought it to this place, having made the voyage from the port of Vera Cruz to the port of Campeche in 24t hours. The devotion and confidence manifested with regard to this effigy in this district is truly surprising. There are also two shrines out of the town, the one Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe, and the other El Santo Nombre de Jesus, which is the parish church of the Negroes. This town has carried on a considerable commerce in the dyeing woods of Campeche, which it used to ship, together with other articles, such as black wax and cotton ; but this has greatly fallen off, on account of the distressing invasions that it has experienced. The first of these was by the English, who took and sacked it in the year 1659; afterwards by the pirate Lewis Scott, in 1678; and again by the Flibustiers, in 1685, when the principal fort was burnt and destroyed . It afterwards became a wood inhabited by birds and animals. [In the Maya language, cam signifies serpent, and peche the little insect (acarus), called by the Spaniards garapala y which penetrates the skin, and occasions a smart pain.

==[[Canada|CANADA|New France]]==, a province and colony of N. America, the limits of which are esteemed various, and have in fact been the occasion of many disputes and Avars between the French and the English. Some maintain that it extends from Florida to the extremity of N. America, or from 33° to 65° n. lat. ; but the country properly called Canada is a small part of the above territory, situate s. and e. of the river St. Lawrence. Others assert that its limits are, on the n. the land of Labrador or New Britain, on* the e. the N. sea and New England, on the s, Florida, and on the w. Nuevo Mexico ; according to which, it would extend itself from 25° to 53° n. lat. and from 76° to 93° w. long, but the utmost of its extent is commonly taken from s^ zo. to n. e. that is, from the province of Padoan in Nueva Espana to cape Charles in the bay of St. Lawrence, which computes to about 900 leagues. The Baron of Hontarn allows its limits to reach only from 39° to 65° of lat. that is, from the s. part of lake Erie to the n. of Hudson's bay, and in length from the river Mississippi to Race cape in Newfoundland. According to the late observations of Mr. Bellin, the province of Louisiana extends many degrees farther to the w. of the above river. The climate of Canada is very various : The whole of the part inhabited by the French, to the shore of the liver St. Lawrence," is excessively cold during the winter, although hot in summer ; the other parts^ as far as has at present been discovered, contain immense forests, lakes, and rivers, and the cold is there very great. Nevertheless, fertile plains are not wanting, which produce all kinds of grain, fruits, and plants ; of the latter the tobacco plant is most abundant, and is particularly cultivated by the French. The forests abound iu deer, dantas, wild cats, bulls, many kinds of goats, wolves, and other animals ; also in a variety of birds. The plains, which arc well irrigated, afford excellent pastures, in which breed numerous herds  I   CANADA.  of cattle, both of the larger and smaller kind. On the mountains is found pitcoal, and some even assert that there are also mines of silver and other metals, though to the present day we have never heard of such mines having been worked. In the uncultivated wastes of an immense extent, are found beavers, and in the rivers and lakes every kind offish. Its principal lakes are Erie, Michigan, Huron, Superior, Frontenac or Ontario, Nipysing, Tomiscaning, and many other of less note ; but the largest of all is lake Superior, situate farther n. than the rest ; this is 100 leagues in length, and 70 in breadth, and in it are various islands, viz. Royal island, Philip, Pont, Chartrain  
Maurepas, St. Anne, St.  
Ignai  
Tison, and many sea  smaller ones. All this extensive country is full of the largest rivers, the enumeration of which would be tedious : the two principal, however, are those of St. Lawrence and Mississippi: the former of these abounds in a profuse variety of excellent fish, and receives various other rivers in its course. The entrance of the bay of St. Lawrence is situate between the cape Retag of the island of Newfoundland, and N. cape of Royal island, or Cape Breton. The Mississippi, which runs through the greatest part of the province of Louisiana from n. to s. is called by the French the river of St. Louis, and by the natives Misehispi, Mississippi or Meschagamisii, from its inundating vast tracts of land at the time of its flushes. The French established themselves in this province in the year 1535, under the command of Jacob Cartier. They also commenced a commerce with the Indians, taking of them hides in exchange for brandy, tobacco, powder and shot, axes, and all kinds of iron tools ; and for the proper conducting of this mercantile system, a body of men were established, called runners of the mountain, who, traversing in their canoes the widest lakes and largest rivers, carry at the present day, with incredible industry and patience, effects to "the most distant, inland and unknown parts. These people brought their hides to the fair of Montreal, which was held in June, when large feasts were made, and guards established under the directions and assistance of the governor, for the maintenance of order ; a precaution most necessary, when it is considered how many savage nations were assembled, some coming from a thousand miles distance. A trade is also carried on by •the canal, in as much as many stop with their merchandize at Albany in New York, where they procure the desired effects with more convenience than at Montreal ; thus avoiding the labour of a journey of more than 200 miles, and the obligation of buying at second hand what they thus obtain at the first. The French likewise find it much more to their advantage to buy their effects of the English at New York, than to bring them from their colonies, encountering the troublesome navigation from the mouth of the river St. Lawrence to Montreal. The English, under the command of General Wolfe, conquered this province at the expence of much bloodshed, and with the loss of the general himself. They remained masters of it by the peace of the year 1763, establishing (in order to avoid occasions of dispute in future) its limits by a line drawn through the middle of the river Mississippi and the lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain to the but it was delivered over to the French in the   peace of 1783. Its capital is Quebec.

Situation and Division.— The British provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, constituted by act of parliament in 1791, comprehend the territory heretofore called Canada. They lie between 61° and 81° w. long, from London, and between 42° 30' and 52° n. lat. ; in length about 1400 miles, and in breadth 500. Bounded n. by New Britain and unknown countries ; e. by New Britain and the gulf of St Lawrence ; s.e. and s. by the province of New Brunswick, the district of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, and the lakes ; the w. boundary is undefined. The province of Upper Canada is the same as what has been commonly called the Upper Country. It liesw. of the great lakes, and is separated from -New York by the river St. Lawrence, here called the Cataraqui, and the lakes Ontario and Erie. Lower Canada lies on both sides the river St, Lawrence between 61° and 71° w. long, from London, and 45° and 52° n. lat. and is bounded s. by New Brunswick Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New Yorkand w. by Upper Canada. The line between Upper and Lower Canada commences at a stone boundary on the n. bank of lake St. Francis, in St. Lawrence river, at the cove w. of Point au Boudet, thence n. to Ottawas river, and to its source in lake Tomiscaning, thence due n. till it strikes the boundary of Hudson bay, or -New Britain 1

[Upper Canada includes all the territory to the«. and s. of the said line, to the utmost extent of the country known by the name of Canada. 
2. Climate. — Winter continues with such seve- -rity from December to April, as that the largest rivers are frozen over, and the snow lies commonly from four to six feet deep during the winter. But the air is so serene and clear, and the inhabitants so well defended against the cold, that this season is neither unhealthy nor unpleasant. The spring opens suddenly, and vegetation is surprisingly rapid. The summer is delightful, except that apart of it is extremely hot. The climate of Lower Ca. nada is liable to violent extremes of heat and cold ; the thermometer is sometimes up to 103° of Fahrenheit in summer, and in winter 36° below 0. These extremes do not, however, last above two or three days at a time. The average of summer beat is, in general, from 75° to 80°, and the mean of the cold in winter about 0. It is the general opinion of the inhabitants that the winters are milder, and that less snow falls now than formerly ; that the summers are also hotter. This might be easily accounted for by the improved state of the country. The clearing of the woods, and cultivation of the lands, together with the increased population, must naturally have a considerable effect upon the climate. It has been observed by some of the religious orders who have been in the practice of keeping meteorological journals, that the winters are as hard as they were formerly, though somewhat shorter, and the summers rather longer, but not hotter than they used fo be. The winters sometimes differ so materially -from each other, as well as the summers, that no accurate estimate can be formed, sufficient to ascertain whether the changes that take place, are occasioned by any increaseor diminution of the severity of the climate. It is possible that a very hot summer, by heating the soil beyond the usual depth, can occasion the mildness of the subsequent winter. The Canadians feel the cold more than Europeans on their first arrival. The constant use of stoves renders -them very little better than hothouse plants during winter, and in summer they are exposed to a burning sun. These things do not affect the European constitution for the first two or three years, but afterwards it becomes as sensible to the heat and cold, as that of the Canadians. It may astonish those who have heard such dreadful accounts of a Canadian winter, but the people of Great Britain suffer more from the cold than the people of Canada, or at least they are more exposed to itfor they seldom make any material alteration  in their dress, either summer or winter ; and, with their open fireplaces, they are burning on one side, and freezing on the other. This, however, hardens the constitution of an Englishman, while the stoves and warm clothing of Canada, which often heat the body beyond what the climate requires, weaken and debilitate the frames of those who reside in that country. A proper attention, however, to heat and cold, is all that is requisite for an European to enjoy the most perfect health in Lower Canada. The months of March and April are in general very hot, andthe sun then begins to have great power, Avhich is considerably heightened by the reflection of the snow and ice. The inhabitants are more tanned by the reflection of the snow in these months, than they are at any other season of the year by the sun. It is likewise so very hurtful to the eyes, that they are obliged to wear shades of green gauze fastened to their hats. The snow begins to melt early in April, and by the second or third week it is generally all gone ; during this period both walking in town, and travelling in the eountry, are very inconvenient. The streets of Quebec are inundated with snowwater, and the kennels have the appearance and sound of so many little rapids. The ice in the river is seldom totally gone before the first week in May. The breaking up of the ice in the vicinity of Quebec is not attended with any remarkable noise or appearance ; but at Montreal, and the upper parts of the river, where it is frozen quite across, it has a grand appearance, and breaks up with loud reports. The lake ice comes down in prodigious quantities for several days, bringing with it the roots and branches of trees which it tears from the islands and shores in its progress. Until this has passed, none of the river vessels can leave Quebec for Montreal. Vessels, however, sometimes arrive from Europe in the midst of it, as was the case in 1807. The first vessel that arrived from Europe in 1808, came up to Quebec on the 19th of April, nine days earlier than the preceding year. The river, however was full of ice, which floated with the tide in large masses. The vessel was forced ashore on the island a few days before it got up to the town, and was near being lost. The progress of vegetation, as soon as the winter is over, is exceedingly rapid. The trees obtain their verdant foliage in less than three weeks ; the fields, which the autumn before were apparently burnt up, are now adorned with the richest verdure. Spring can scarcely be said to exist before summer is at hand. The productions of the field and the garden are brought in quick succession to the markets ; and fresh meat, poultry,]

[and vegetables, now regale the inhabitants, who tor so many months had been confined to their frozen provisions. The months of May and June are often wet, sometimes greatly to the detriment of husbandry. In the spring of 1807 the weather was unusually wet, from the latter end of April until the JOth of June, when it cleared up, after a most violent thunderstorm which' happened on the 9th. During May, scarcely a day passed without rain, and the weather was excessively changeable : Fahrenheit's thermometer was sometimes as high as 75, and at other times as low as 20, in the course pf 21 hours. The farmers had not finished sowing by the middle of June, though they in -general get all their wheat into the ground by the 20th of May. Some people are of opinion, that sowing late answers best in Canada, as the ground has then time, to imbibe the heat of the sun after the snow has melted ; and that wheat sown in June is ripe as soon as that sown in May. The practice of the Canadian farmers is, however, contrary to this theory. Thunder and lighting do not very often visit Canada ; but when they do, their violence is great, and damage generally ensues. The following is a tolerable correct state of Fahrenheit's thermometer in the shade during the summer of 1807 : 
Lowest. Highest. May - - - 20 - - 75 continual rain. June - - - 50 - - 90 rain the first week, afterwards dry and warm. July . ._ - 55 - - 96 dry and sultry. August - - 68 - - 90 fine warm weather with little rain. September 46 - - 78 fine mild weather. 
The spring, summer, and autumn of Canada, are all comprised in these five months. The rest of the year may be said to consist wholly of winter. One of the greatest plagues to which the inhabitantsof Canada are subject, are the common houseflies, which are extremely troublesome in the months of June, July, and August. Thestoves keep them alive in winter, and the sun restores them to their full vigour and power of annoying in the summer. The sting of the musquito, an insect abounding in all moist or shady situations, is trifling at first, but the next day is extremely painful, and sometimes dangerous, if violently rubbed. The best remedy is to wash the part with some powerful acid, such as lemonjuice or vinegar. The brulots or sandflies are so very small 4 as to be hardly perceptible in their attacks, and your forehead will be streaming with blood before you are sensible of being amongst them. These are the only disagreeables that are attached to a Canadian summer ; were it free from them, it would be equal to that of any  other country in the world ; but as it, is a burning sun, houseflies, musquitos, and sand-Hies, certainly prevent the finest months of the year from being enjoyed in full perfection. The summer of 1808 was the hottest that has been known for several years in Canada. In the months of July and August, the thermometer was several times at 90 and 95, and one or two days it rose to 103 in the shade, at Montreal and the Three Rivers. At Quebec it was 101 or 102. The fall of the year is the most agreeable season in Canada. The sultry weather is then gone, and the night frosts have entirely destroyed the venomous insects, or rendered them torpid. 
3. Natural curiosities. — The face of Lower Canada is remarkably bold and striking. The noble river St. Lawrence, flowing more than 400 miles between high lands and lofty mountains, sometimes divided into channels by large islands, and at other times intersected by clusters of small ones ; numerous rapid streams, rolling from the neighbouring mountains, breaking over steep precipices, and mingling their waters with the grand river ; its bold and rugged shores, lofty eminences, and sloping valleys, covered with the umbrageous foliage of immense forests, or interspersed with the cultivated settlements of the inhabitants, — present altogether to the eye of the spectator a succession of the most sublime and picturesque objects that imagination can conceive. Beyond the rapids of liicblieuy which are situate about 400 miles from the entrance of the St. Lawrence, the country assumes a more level aspect; the mountains retire to the n. and s., as far as the eye can reach, leaving all that part of Canada, extending to the s. w. and n. e. an almost interminable flat. Frozen oceans, gulfs, and bays ; immense lakes and wildernesses, diversified at times by chains of enormous mountains, form the features of the remaining part of the British settlements in N. America, which extend from the coast of Labrador to the sea of Kamtschatka and the Pacific ocean, and to the n. beyond the Arctic circle. The mountain on which Quebec is built, and the high lands for several miles along the St. Lawrence, consist chiefly of black lime slate. A few mountains in the neighbourhood are composed of grey rock stone ; but they, for the most part, stand on a bed of lime slate. About a yard from the surface this slate is quite compact, and without any cracks, so that one cannot perceive it is a slate, its particles being imperceptible. It lies in strata Which vary from three or four to 20 inches thick, and upwards. In Quebec the strata lie in some parts diagonally &gt; in others almost perpendicular, but none horizontally, and bear every mark of having been violently} l, h 2

CANADA.  
[agitated by some convulsion of nature, which must have shaken the mountain to its very foundation. Possibly it might have lost its horizontal direction by the earthquake of 1663. In the unpaved streets of Quebec this slaty stone strikes out in corners at the surface, and injures the shoes extremely. The narrow crevices between the shivers, which are very thin, are commonly filled with a fibrous white gypsum ; the larger cracks are in particular parts of the rock filled up with transparent quartz crystals, the largest of which are about two inches in length, and three or four in circumference; but in general they are extremely small, and many resent ble well cut polished diamonds. A sort of black or grey spar is also frequently met with in the rock. Most of the old .houses are built of the lime slate, but it shivers into thin pieces on the outside after being exposed to the air for some time ; the masons, however, have a particular manner of placing the pieces of stone, which prevents them from cracking, except a little on the outside. The new public buddings, fortifications, and many of the private houses belonging to the gentry at Quebec, have of late years been bnilt with the grey rock stone, which has a light and handsome appearance, and is of a more durable nature. The mountains and high lands in the vicinity of Quebec, and for many miles below, consist of different species of the lime slate, and of the grey rock or lime stone, more or less impregnated with grey and black glimmer and quartz, fibrous gypsum and pierre au calumet. The latter has received its name from the French, who, as well as the Indians, frequently use it for the heads of their calumets or tobacco pipes. It is a lime stone of rather a soft though compact texture, and may be cut with a knife. Iron, copper, and lead ore, are found in different parts of Lower Canada, though not to any very great extent. Iron is most abundant, and has been discovered chiefly on the n. side of the St. Lawrence, about Batiscan and Three Rivers. It was formerly believed that a silver mine existed near St. Paul's bay, about 54 miles below Quebec, on the n. shore, several pieces of ore having been discovered, which resembled that metal : it has since been found to consist only of lead, which lies in veins in a mountain of grey rock stone. No very important discoveries have hitherto been made in the mineral world of Lower Canada ; though in that, as well as in every other branch of natural history, there is sufficient in that country to occupy the attention of the philosopher. Some mineral springs have been discovered in different parts of the province; one or two were found in the neighbourhood of Three Rivers, but are now either lost or remain unnoticed.  
Another was discovered in the suburb of St. John, just without the walls of Quebec ; this has been kept open for several years, and belongs to an old French woman, who has a small house adjoining it. Many of the gentry walk out to this house in the summer about six o'clock in the morning, and drink the waters, which are reckoned extremely salubrious ; they are tasteless, but it is necessary to hold your nose when you drink them, for they have a very unpleasant sulphureous smell. Several excellent springs of fresh water gush out of various parts of the rock. The inhabitants, however, chiefly use the river water, though it is not reckoned very wholesome in winter. The water is conveyed in barrels from the river to all parts of the upper and lower towns by the carters, who charge sixpence or eightpence per barrel according to the distance. In different parts of the country, and particularly the vicinity of Quebec, are to be found rock stones of various shapes and sizes, lying scattered in the fields, meadows, and plains. Some of them measure nine or ten feet in circumference, and from three to four ieet high ; and some even have been met with considerably larger. They are mostly of a grey colour, roundshaped, and of a very close and hard substance, impregnated with black, red, and white glimmer and spar. They lie upon the soil, having no connection with any rock or bed of stone ; and a person cannot view them without asking himself the question, how, and in what manner, such large masses of stone came there ? It was upon one of these stones that General Wolfe is said to have breathed his last. On the whole, few natural curiosities are to be found in Lower Canada, except rapiHs, cascades, and falls. Among the latter, those of Saguenay, Montmorency, and Chaudiere, are the chief; an account of which maybe seen under their proper articles. There are two smaller rapids near Montreal, one about a mile and a half belo vv the city, and the other about five miles above : the latter is called Sault St. Louis, or the Fall of St. Louis ; but it is a mere rapid, similar to those of the Richlieu, except that the river at St. Louis is divided into channels by two or three small islands, which form, with the rapidity of the agitated stream, a very picturesque and beautiful view. The cascades, near the boundary line between Upper and Lower Canada, are of a different description to the rapids of Richlieu, St. Louis, &amp;c. and seem to present an almost insuperable bar to the navigation of the river between the two provinces: this obstacle is however in some measure removed by the construction of locks and canals on the w. shore, through which the batteaux and small vessels pass. The cascades]    

CANADA:  
[are about two miles in length, and are as violentlyagitated in tbe calmest weather, as the ocean is in a gale of wind. The Waters appear as if they rushed into an immense gulf, and were boiled up again by some subterranean fire. Rafts of timber, and large scows, laden with barrels of flour, potash, and pro* visions, pass through these tremendousrapids every year with safety ; but smaller vessels cannot attempt it' without imminent danger. About three miles above the cascades, are the rapids of the Cedars ; they are less violent than the former, but are infinitely more dangerous than the Ricblieu and St. Louis ; yet the Canadians and Indians are so very expert in the management of their canoes and batteaux, that an accident very rarely happens in passing any of the rapids. 
4. Soil and Productions. — Though the climate be cold, and the winter long and tedious, the soil is in general very good, and in many parts both pleasant and fertile, producing wheat, barley, rye, with many other sorts of grain, fruits, and vegetables ; tobacco, in particular, thrives well, and is much cultivated. The isle of Orleans near Quebec, and the lands upon the river St. Lawrence, and other rivers, are remarkable for the richness of the soil. Tbe meadow grounds in Canada, which are well watered, yield excellent grass, and feed great numbers of great and small cattle. Within the last 20 years, great quantities of wheat have been raised in Canada, and exported to Great Britain. The temporary scarcity experienced in England, at certain periods, increased the demand for that article, and encouraged the Canadians to cultivate it with more spirit than, till then, they had been accustomed to. The fruit of Canada is not remarkable either for goodness or cheapness, except strawberries and raspberries, which are brought to market in great abundance during the season. They are gathered on the plains at the back of Quebec, and in the neighbouring woods, where they grow upon the ground, or among the shrubs, in wild luxuriance. The poor Canadians send their children to gather them, and afterwards sell them to the inhabitants at a moderate price. It is an agreeable sight to view the fields covered with strawberries in blossom or ripe, and few persons keep them in gardens. The raspberry bushes are intermingled with the underwood of the forests, and afford an agreeable treat to those who are fond of rambling in the woods. That pleasure is, however, more than counterbalanced by the musquitos and sand*.flies, which never fail, for three or four months in the summer, to annoy those who venture to penetrate their abode. Apples and pears are procured from Montreal, where they grow in  more abundance and in greater perfection than in any other part of Lower Canada. They are sold for much the same price as in England. The apple which is most prized is what they call the pomme gris, a small lightbrown apple somewhat resembling the russetin in appearance. Many persons say, that it is superior to any English apple. Bread is not cheap in Canada, and generally of very indifferent quality, though several Scotch bakers have emigrated to that country. They complain of the want of yeast at certain seasons,: their bad bread is perhaps oftener occasioned by the indifferent flour which they purchase of the Habitans in the marketplace at a low price, and which they mix with the better sort of flour sup. plied from the mills of Colonel Caldwell, Messrs, Coltman, and others. The soil of Lower Canada is composed of great varieties, and is more or less fertile as it approaches to the n. or s. The high lands, with good management, would yield very-  tolerable  crops,  but the Canadians are  farmers. They seldom or never* manure their land, and plough so very slight and careless, that they continue year after year to turn over the same clods which lie at the surface, without penetrating an inch deeper into the soil. Hence their grounds become exhausted, overrun with weeds, and yield but very scanty crops. From Quebec, the capital, to Montreal, which is about 170 miles, in sailing up the river St. Lawrence, the eye is entertained with beautiful landscapes, the banks being in many places very bold and steep, and shaded with lofty trees. The farms lie pretty close all the way ; several gentlemen's houses, neatly built, shew themselves at intervals, and there is all the appearance of a flourishing colony ; but there are few towns or villages. Many beautiful islands are interspersed in the channel of the river, which have an agreeable effect upon the eye. For further account of the productions of this country Quebec. 
5. Religion. — When Canada surrendered to the English, the free exercise of the Roman Catholic religion was stipulated for, and granted. Its ministers were also to be protected and supported as they had formerly been ; the Jesuits and Recollets only excepted, whose orders were to remain as they then were, without receiving in future any augmentation of their numbers. While there existed an individual of their order, the revenues and property belonging to it were to be at his disposal ; but at his death they reverted to the king, and the order became extinct. Of the three religious male orders at that time in existence, the priests alone were allowed to increase their num-]   
■

[bers, and to officiate in every respect as they had been accustomed to under the French government. The female orders being charitable institutions, and beneficial to the colony, were also allowed to exist, and were permitted to fill up their vacancies and increase their establishments as they had formerly done. They were to be protected in their persons and property, upon the same footing as under the French government. As many as about ninetenths of the inhabitants of these provinces are Roman Catholics, who enjoy, under the present government, the same provision, rights, and privileges, as were granted them in 1774, by the act of the 14th of George 111. The rest of the people are Episcopalians, Presbyterians, and a few of almost all the different sects of Christians. 
6. Population. — The population of Canada has, in the course of the last 40 years, more than trebled itself. The first census after the English conquered the country, was made by General Murray in 1765. This estimate fails considerably short of the population of 1758, as mentioned by Mr. Heriot in his recent work. Mr. Heriot states, that " the white inhabitants of Canada amounted in 1758 to 91,000, exclusive of the regular troops, who were augmented or diminished as the circumstances or exigencies of the country might require; that the domiciliated Indians who were collected into villages in different situations in the colony were about 16,000, and the number of French and Canadians resident in Quebec was nearly 8000." If the Indians and inhabitants of Quebec are not included in the first number, and we suppose the Indians are not, as Mr. Heriot particularly mentions white inhabitants, the total population, exclusive of regular troops, would then be 115,000. The province of Canada was not divided into Upper and Lower till the year 1792 ; the census', therefore, that were taken antecedent to that period, included the population of the whole colony. We are not acquainted with the source from whence Mr. Heriot derived his information, but the census of General Murray, seven years subsequent to 1758, stated the entire population of the province to be, exclusive of the king's troops, 76,275. This number included the Indians, who were statsd to amount only to 7400. Here is a vast and surprising decrease of the inhabitants in the course of seven years ; and upon the supposition that the numbers in 1758 were 115,000, there  is a loss of no less than 38,725 ; but taking it only at 91,000, still there is a decrease of 14,725 of thecolonists and native inhabitants. We may easily suppose that a long war, and finally the subjugation of the country, by a power totally opposite in national manners, character, and principles, must have occasioned a considerable diminution of its population ; for besides those who were lost in battle, numbers no doubt emigrated to Old France, or to other countries where they might find a oo- vernment more congenial to their habits and sentiments. If we look at the number of Indians whom Mr. Heriot states to have been domiciliated in the province in 1758, and the number given in by the census of 1765, we shall there alone find a loss of 8600. It is possible that the ravages of war might occasion this great loss, for in the course of a campaign, the Indians are oftener opposed to enemies of their own description than to the European armies, and their mode of fighting occasions a greater slaughter. -.We have no doubt, therefore, that this remarkable decrease of the population of Canada, in the course of so short a period, may be satisfactorily accounted for, when we consider the war that preceded the conquest, and the very unsettled state of the country for a considerable time after that event. The dissensions between the army and civil power of the British government, and the disgust which the French noblesse, the clergy, and inhabitants, felt at being subjected to the will of a foreign people, must have strongly tended to emigration, and contributed, with the losses sustained by the war, to thin the population of the colony, which was far from being recruited by British settlers, who, in six years after the conquest, did not amount to more than 500 persons. In no other way, (if Mr. Heriot's statement be correct), can we account for the difference between the population of 1758 and the census of 1765. In 1783 another census was taken by order of the Canadian government ; since then no other has been made, nor have we any data upon which we can rely, for the forming a correct estimate of the state of the country and its population at the present day. But, by a comparison of the census of 1765 and 1783, we may be enabled to judge of the benefits which Canada has received from its new government, and perhaps form some notion of its progress for the last 20 years ; for this purpose we shall present them in detail.

These statistical accounts are highly satisfactory ; and exhibit, in a clear and convincing manner, the benefits that have resulted to the colony under the excellent constitution of Great Britain. No sooner •was a regular form of government established, and the minds of the people tranquillized, than British subjects were induced to emigrate to Canada, and embark their property in agricultural or commercial speculations. These enterprising settlers communicated their spirit, in a certain degree, to the old inhabitants ; and hence the surprising increase of population, commerce, and agriculture, which took place in the short period of 18 years. Since the year 1783, the colony has been gradually advancing in improvement. Its commerce has at times fluctuated considerably ; but population and agriculture have rarMdly augmented. The number of inhabitants in Lower Canada, at the present day, is computed by Mr. Heriot at 250,000 ; but we think this estimate is much exaggerated, for if we calculate the population agreeably to the ratio  of its increase from 1765 to 1783, during which period of 18 years it augmented nearly onehalf, we shall find that in 25 years, from 1783 to 1808, the total amount will not exceed 200,000 ; and this number, we are of opinion, is nearest the truth. Upper Canada is stated by Mr. Heriot to hav© 80,000 inhabitants : this number may possibly be correct; butwepreferthe authorities which compute it at only 60,000 ; truth, however, may perhaps be found in the medium between the two. There is every reason to suppose that no diminution whatever has taken place in any part of those details ; but that the augmentation which occurred between 1765 and 1783 has continued, with little variation, in the same regular manner, for the last 25 years. Upon this hypothesis we shall ofler the following statistical statement for the year 1808. In the absence of official documents, it may afford some idea of the resources of Lower Canada at the present day.

Of the inhabitants of Lower Canada not more than onetenth are British, or American settlers from the United States. In Upper Canada the population is almost entirely composed of the latter, and of British subjects who have emigrated from various parts of the united kingdom. Very few French people reside in that province^ and it is a remarkable circumstance, that among all the British residents in the two colonies, not 200 Englishmen perhaps can be found. We are told that at Quebec there are not more than i2 or 14 of that country ; the rest are either Irish  or Scotch, though the former bear no proportion to the latter, who are distributed from one end of the Canadas to the other. The Irish emigrate more to the United States than to Canada, and no less than 30,000 are said to hare emigrated thither in 1801. Being discontented with their own government, they endeavour to seek relief under a foreign one, whose virtues have been so greatly exaggerated, and wbose excellent properties have been extolled to the skies. A few months, however, convince them of their error, and those who are not sold to their American masters generally]    264  

CANADA.  
[find their way into Upper Canada. Of all the British emigrants the Scotch are the most indefatigable and persevering. In poverty they leave their native home ; yet seldom return to it without a handsome competency. Their patient diligence and submission in the pursuit of riches, together with their general Jknowledge and good sense, render them highly beneficial to the mother country ; while their natural partiality for their ancient soil secures their steady attachment and adherence to the British government. 
7. Manners and Customs.— The houses of the Habitans are composed of logs slightly smoothed with the axe, laid upon each other, and dovetailed at the corners. Sometimes a framework is first constructed, and the logs laid upon each other between two grooves. The interstices are filled with clay or mud, and the sides of the building washed outside and in, with lime dissolved in water. This, they say, has the property of preserving the wood better than paint from the effects of the weather and vermine ; at all events, it has the property of being cheaper, which is a consideration of more importance to them than weather or vermine. The chimney is built in the centre of the house ; and the room which contains the fireplace is the kitchen. The rest are bedrooms, for it matters not how many apartments a house consists of; they are seldom without one or two beds in each, according to the size of the family. This indispensable piece of furniture, which is always placed in one corner of the room, is a sort of fourpost bedstead without the pillars, and raised three or four feet from the ground. At the head there is generally a canopy or tester fixed against the wall, under which the bed stands ; upon the bedstead is placed a feather or straw bed, with the usual clothes, and covered with a patchwork counterpane, or green stuff quilt, In winter, the men frequently lay themselves along the hearth, or by the stove, wrapped up in a buffalo robe. In the middle of the night they willget up, stir the fire, smoke their pipe, and lie downagain till morning. The furniture is plain and simple, and most commonly of their own workmanship. A few wooden chairs, with twig or rush bottoms, and two or three deal tables, are placed in each room., and are seldom very ornamental ; they, however, suffice, with a proper number of wooden bowls, trenchers, and spoons, for the use of the family at meals. A press and two or three large chests contain their wearing apparel, and other property. A buffet in one corner contains their small display of cups, saucers, glasses, aud teapots, while a tew broken sets may perhaps grace the mantlepiece. A large clock is often found in their best  apartment, and the sides of the room are ornamented with little pictures, or waxen images of saints and crucifixes, of the holy virgin and her son. An iron stove is generally placed in the largest apartment, with a pipe passing through the others into the chimney. The kitchen displays very little more than kettles of soup, tureens of milk, a table, a dresser, and a few chairs. 
The children of the Habitans are generally pretty when young, but from sitting over the stoves in winter, and labouring in the fields in summer, their complexion becomes swarthy, and their features ordinary and coarse. The boys adopt the pernicious habit of smoking, almost as soon as they have strength to hold a pipe in their mouth : this must insensibly injure the constitution, though from the mildness of their tobacco, its effects must be less deleterious than that used in the United States or British West Indies. The girls, from manual labour, become strongboned and masculine ; and after SO years of age, have every appearance of early decrepitude ; yet their constitutions frequently remain robust and healthy, and some few live to a considerable age. The women are prolific, and fat chubby children may be seen at every Habitan's door. We have never heard, however, that the St. Lawrence possesses such properties as are ascribed to the waters of the Mississippi, which are said to facilitate procreation in the Louisianian females. It is even saidy that women who, in other parts of the world could never breed, have become pregnant in a year after their arrival in Louisiana. The manners of the Habitans are easy and polite. Their behaviour to strangers is never influenced by the cut of a coat or a fine perriwig. It is civil and respectful to all, without distinction of persons. They treat their superiors with that polite deference which neither debases the one, nor exalts the other. They are never rude to their inferiors because they are poor, for if they do not relieve poverty, they will not insult it. Their carriage and deportment are easy and unrestrained ; and they have the air of men who have lived all their days in a town rather than in the country. They live on good terms with each other; parents and children to the third generationreslding frequently in one house. The farm is divided as long as there is an acre to divide; and their desire of living together is a proof that they live happy, otherwise they would be anxious to part. They are fond of celebrating their marriages with great pomp ; and those who live in the towns, and are married in the morning, often parade the streets with their friends in the afternoon. The carriages]  

CANADA.  
[made use of in Canada, are calashes for the summer, and carioles and berlins for the winter. The calash is in general use all over the country, and is used alike by the gentry and Habitans ; only that those belonging to the former are of a superior description. The calash is a sort of onehorsechaise, capable of holding two persons besides the driver, who sits in front upon a low seat, with his feet resting upon the shafts. The harness is sometimes very heavy, and studded with a great number of brass nails, but that is now nearly exploded, and has given place to a much lighter and simpler caparison. It is used as well for carts as for the calash, and is several pounds lighter than the cumbersome English collar and harness. Plated harness is used for the best calashes, though made in the same simple form, and requires merely a ring and a bolt, which, fastened to each shaft, secures the horse in the cart [or calash, the sleigh or the cariole. The carioles nearly resemble the body of a onehorsechaise, placed upon two runners, like the irons of a pair of skates. They are painted, varnished, and lined like the better sort of calashes. The driver generally stands up in front, though there is a seat for him similar to that in the calash. Between him and the horse, there is a high pannel, which reaches up to his breast, and prevents the splashes from being thrown into the cariole. The body of the vehicle is sometimes placed on high runners of iron, though in general the low wooden runners are preferred, as they are not so liable to be upset as the others. Seldom more than one horse is driven in the cariole, but the dashing youths in the army, the government service, or among the merchants, are fond of displaying their scientific management of the whip in the tandem style. There is hardly a Habitant in Canada who does not keep his horse and cart, calash, and berlin. Carters are also numerous in the towns, and calashes or carioles, &amp;c. may be hired of them at a moderate price. They stand in the marketplaces, both winter and summer, looking out for employment. Their horses are generally in good condition, though their labour is hard, and their treatment severe. The French Canadians are remarkably civil to each other, and bow and scrape as they pass along the streets. The carmen or peasants are used to meet cap in hand, with bodies bent to each other ; sometimes the men kiss each other on the cheek, but the practice is not in general use. . They are extremely civil and polite to strangers, and take off their cap to every person, indifferently, whom they pass on the road. They seldom quarrel but when intoxicated; at other times they are good tol. i.  humoured, peaceable, and friendly. They are fond of dancing and entertainments at particular seasons and festivals, on which occasions they eat, drink, and dance in constant succession. When their long fast in Lent is concluded, they have their " jours gras," or days of feasting. Then it is that every production of their farm is presented for the gratification of their appetites; immense turkeypies ; huge joints of pork, beef, and mutton ; spacious tureens of soup, or thickmilk ; besides fish, fowl, and a plentiful supply of fruitpies, decorate the board. Perhaps 50 or 100 sit down to dinner; rum is drank by the half pint, often without water ; the tables groan with their load, and the room resounds with jollity and merriment. No sooner, however, does of the knives and forks cease, than the violin strikes up, and the dances commence. Minuets, and a sort of reels or jigs, rudely performed to the discordant scrapings of a couple of vile fiddlers, conclude the festival. See account of the inhabitants of Quebec under that article. 
8. Government. — The form of government in Canada is an epitome of the British constitution. In the Upper province it assimilates itself nearer to that of the parent country than in Lower Canada, the laws of which have unavoidably been obliged to admit of some local alterations, in order to adapt them to the majority of the people whom they govern, and who differ in so many respects from those of Upper Canada. The civil government of the province consists of a governor, who is also a military man, and commanderinchief of the forces; a lieutenantgovernor, an executive and legislative council, and house of assembly. In the absence of the governor and lieutenantgovernor, the president of the executive council succeeds to the head of affairs, as was exactly the case a few years since ; Mr. Dunn being then president of the province, in the absence of general Prescott, the governor, and Sir Robert Milnes, the lieutenantgovernor. On casions, the powers of the president are more circumscribed than those of the governor, and even the executive council is timorous, and reluctant to take any responsibility upon itself. The executive council, like the privy council of England, has the management of the executive part of the government, and is appointed by his Majesty. The legislative council, and house of assembly, form the provincial parliament. The governor, or person administering the government, represents the sovereign, and opens, prorogues, or dissolves the assembly ; gives or refuses his assent to bills, or reserves them for his Majesty's] 
M M    CANADA.    [pleasure. The bills to which he assents,~are put in force immediately, and true copies transmitted to the British government, for the approbation of the king in council. Certain acts of the provincial parliament, which go to repeal or vary the laws that were in existence at the time the present constitution was established, respecting tithes ; the appropriation of land for the support of the Protestant clergy ; the constituting and endowing of parsonages and rectories ; the right of presentation to the same ; the enjoyment and exercise of any mode of worship ; the imposing of any burthens or disqualifications on account of the same ; the rights of the clergy to recover their accustomed dues or emoluments to any ecclesiastics ; the establishment and discipline of the church of England; the king's prerogative concerning the granting of waste lands of the crown within the province ; are to be laid before the British parliament before they receive the royal assent. The acts of the provincial parliament are merely of a local nature, regulating the interior of the country, and creating a revenue for the maintenance of the government. The legislative council consists of 15 members, appointed for life by the governor, who is invested with powers for that purpose by his Majesty. No one can be a counsellor who is not 21 years of age, and a natural born subject, or naturalized according to act of parliament. The house of assembly consists of 50 members, who are chosen for districts and counties by those who are possessed of freehold property of the clear yearly value of 40/. The members for cities and towns are chosen by voters, whose property consists of a dwelling house and lot of ground, of the yearly value of five pounds sterling, or who have resided in the town for 12 months previous to the writ of summons, and shall have paid one year's rent for a dwelling or lodging, at the rate of 10/. sterling per annum. No person is eligible to a seat in the house of assembly who belongs to the legislative council, or that is a minister of religion, or not a natural bom subject, or naturalized according to law or conquest ; nor any person that has been attainted of treason, or disqualified by any act of the provincial parliament. All religions are tolerated in Canada in the fullest extent, and no disqualification on that account exists for the purpose of preventing any person from a seat in the provincial parliament. Catholics, Jews, and Protestants, have all an equal right to sit, provided they are not disqualified from any other cause. The assembly is not to last longer than four years, but maybe dissolved sooner, and the governor is bound to call it at  least once in each year. The oath of a member taking his seat is comprised in a few words. He promises to bear true allegiance to the kin"-, as lawful sovereign of Great Britain, and the province of Canada dependent upon it ; to defend him against all traitorous conspiracies and attempts against his person, and to make known to him all such conspiracies and attempts which he may at anytime be acquainted with : all which he promises, without mental evasion, reservation, or equivocation, at the same time renouncing all pardons and dispensations from any person or power whatsoever. The provincial parliament is held in the old building called the Bishop's Palace, situate between the grand battery and Prescot gate, at the top of Mountain street. The assembly remains sitting for about three months in the winter, and out of 50 members, seldom more than 20 attend ; one or other contrive to elude their duty by pleas of illness or unavoidable business. The French have a large majority in the house of assembly, their number being 36 to 14 British . The speeches are therefore mostly in French, for the English members all understand and speak that language, while very few of the French members have any knowledge of English. The debates, turning entirelyupon questions of a mere local nature, are seldom interesting. 
Previous to the year 1774, the country was governed by the ordinances of the governor alone ; but the Quebec bill of that year extended Canada to its ancient limits ; and its original system of civil law, the " Custom of Paris," was restored. A new form of government was introduced, and the Roman Catholic clergy, except the monks and Jesuits, were secured in the legal enjoyment of their estates, and of their tithes, from all who were of the Romish religion. No person professing the Protestant religion was to be subject to the payment of tithes, their clergy being supported by the government. The French laws were introduced in civil cases, and the English law, and trial by jury, in criminal cases. In 1791 a bill was passed, which repealed the Quebec bill of 1774, and divided Canada into two separate provinces, the one called Lower, and the other Upper Canada. By this bill, the present form of government was established ; and the Canadians now enjoy all the advantages of the British constitution. In 1794 an act was passed for dividing the province of Lower Canada into three districts, and for augmenting the number of judges. 
9. The military. — The British government seems at present disposed to maintain its possessions in Canada upon a respectable footing. Many]    CANADA  [new appointments have taken place in that country, particularly in the military department. Six inspecting fieldofficers of militia are among the number ; but it is not yet known upon what plan the militia is to be organized, or whether it is to be organized at alL At present there are not 1000 either in Quebec, Three Rivers, or Montreal, that are armed ; and they have furnished themselves with clothing and accoutrements at their own expence, and are in every respect like our volunteers, except that the latter are superior to them in discipline. At the time that a war was expected, in 1807, between Great Britain and the United States, the Canadian people universally offered to embody themselves for the defence of the country. The services of only 5000 were accepted, and they were never armed, as the necessity of the case was not very urgent. The alacrity and zeal with which the Canadians came forward, were however highly honourable to them, and afforded a strong proof of their good sense, in properly appreciating the happiness which they enjoy under a mild and liberal government. The British and FrenchCanadians are divided into separate corps of militia, and officered by their own people ; a distinction which might as well be dispensed with, for it is calculated to prevent that union of interest and sentiment, which ought to prevail between all classes of his Majesty's subjects in the colony. 
10. Laws. — The laws are now administered by two chief justices, and six puisne judges, who are divided equally between Quebec and Montreal. The chief justice of Quebec has however the largest salary, and the title of chief justice of the province. There is also a provincial judge for the district of Three Rivers, who resides there, and is assisted at the two superior terms by the chief justice of Quebec, and one of the puisne judges. The chief presides there only in criminal causes. There is also a judge of the court of viceadmiralty, who resides at Quebec ; and a provincial judge for the inferior district of Gaspe, who resides on that government. Besides the judges, there is an attorney -general, resident at Quebec, and a solicitorgeneral, resident at Montreal. Exclusive of the courts of king's bench and common pleas, there is a court of appeal, which sits the first Monday in every month, as long as business requires. This court is composed of the governor, or person administering the govern-  sessions of the peace are held four times a year. The police of Quebec, Montreal, and Three Rivera, is in the hands of the justices of the peace : they also regulate the price of bread every month, and meet once a week to determine petty causes and offences under ten pounds. Counsellors attend, and argue for their clients, who are put to great expence for summonses, fees, &amp;c. The whole of the business has devolved into the hands of the three magistrates, who erected the edifice for the butchers in the Upper Town marketplace ; and though there are upwards of 30 justices of the peace in Quebec, yet few, except the triumvirate, ever act as such. These magistrates decide causes with as mueh judgment as they design buildings. Thelaws of Lower Canada are, I. The " Coutume de Paris," or Custom of Paris, as it existed in France in the year 1666, in which year the custom was reformed. II. The civil or Roman law in cases where the custom of Paris is silent. III. The edicts, declarations, and ordinances of the French governors of Canada. IV. The acts of the British parliament made concerning Canada. V. The English criminal law in toto, and the acts of the provincial parliament. This complication of French and English laws is rendered necessary by the two different communities which exist in Canada, and may be divided into four distinct parts, viz. The criminal, civil, commercial, and maritime laws. The criminal law is wholly English, and in its administration, all are universally subject to its operations without distinction of persons. The civil law, or compound of laws regarding property, is taken from the «* Coutume of Paris," from the civil law of the Romans, or from such edicts, declarations, and ordinances concerning property, as have been made at any time by the French governors of Canada. To this civil jurisprudence, both the British and French Canadians, in certain cases, are subject. These laws embrace a variety of subjects, particularly the feudal tenures, seigniories, fiefs, and estates held nobly or by villainage ; moveable or immoveable property, marriage dowers, and community of property between man and wife. The commercial laws relate to mercantile transactions, and are regulated nearly in the same manner as in England ; except that in such cases there are no trials by jury, which are confined only to the criminal law. The maritime  ment, and five or more members of the executive law, or court of viceadmiralty, is wholly Eng council, with those judges who have not prelish. Law proceedings are carried on both in viously heard or decided upon the causes which English and French. At the first settling of the are appealed. A further appeal may be made to colony, extensive lots of land, called seigniories, his Majesty in council. The courts of quarter many of them from one to five hundred square] m m 2    268  

CANADA;  
[miles in size, were granted to officers of the army and gentlemenadventurers : These lots. were situated on the borders of the river St. Lawrence, from Kamouraska to several leagues beyond Montreal, comprehending a distance of more than 300 miles. These great proprietors, who were generally men of moderate or small fortunes, and unskilled in agriculture, were unable to manage such vast estates : they were, therefore, under the necessity of making over their lands to soldiers or planters, on condition that they should receive a quitrent and certain services for ever. This was introducing into America a species of tenure somewhat similar to that of the feudal government, which had so long been fatal to Europe. The superior ceded a portion of land to each of his vassals, of about three acres in breadth, and from 70 to 80 in depth, commencing from the banks of the river, and running back into the woods ; thus forming that immense chain of settlements which now exists along the shores of St. Lawrence. The vassal, on his part, engaged to work at certain periods in the seignior's mill, to pay him annually one or two sols per acre, and a bushel and half of corn, for the whole grant. This tax, though but a small one, maintained a considerable number of idle people, at the expence of the only class with which the colony ought to have been peopled ; and the truly useful inhabitants, those engaged in laborious employments, found the burden of maintaining a lazy noblesse increased by the additional exactions of the clergy. The tithes were imposed in 1667, and though this grievous tax upon industry was reduced to a 25th part of the produce of the soil, yet even that was an oppression in an infant colony, and a grievance in a country where the clergy had property allotted them sufficient for their maintenance. There are two kinds of tenure in Lower Canada, viz. the feudal tenure, and the tenure in free and common soccage. By the first all the French Canadians hold their lands, under certain distinctions. By free and common soccage are held those lands which the British settlers have received from the crown, few of them holding lands under the feudal tenure. In order to give some idea of the feudal tenure in this country, it will be necessary to give a sketch of the principal chapters of the " Custom of Paris." The first and most difficult chapter treats of fiefs, the origin of which is uncertain. Before we come to the definition of the nature and different kinds of fiefs, it must be observed, that estates are divided into two kinds in the Custom of Paris : First, those held nobly ; and, secondly, those held by villainage. The estates held  nobly, are the fiefs and Franc aleu noble; and the estates held by villainage, are those held subject to cens or censive, and Franc aleu villain. Fief is an estate held and possessed on condition of fealty and homage, and certain rights, payable generally by the new possessor to the lord of whom the fief is held ; these rights are quint and relief. The quint is the fifth part of the purchase money, and must be paid by the purchaser : this is somewhat similar to the fine of alienation, which, by the ancient English tenure, was paid to the lord upon every mutation of the tenant's property. Relief is the revenue of one year, due to the lord for certain mutations, as if a fief comes to a vassal by succession in the direct line, there is nothing due to the seignior but fealty and homage ; but if in the collateral line, then a fine or composition is paid to the lord upon taking up the estate, which was lapsed or fallen by the death of the last tenant. The feudal lord, within 40 days after the purchase of a fief has been made known to him, can take it to himself by paying to the purchaser the price which he gave for it, with all lawful charges. This privilege, enjoyed by the feudal lord, (and in Canada by the king), is for the purpose of preventing frauds in the disposal of fiefs ; for it has sometimes happened, that by an understanding between the buyer and seller, the quint or fifth has been paid upon only one half, or even a quarter, of the purchase money, instead of the whole. By the right, therefore, which the lord possesses of purchasing the property himself, whenever the nominal sum is not equal to the value of the fief, he immediately ascertains the actual amount of the purchase money, and either receives the whole of the fifth share, or takes the property into his own hands, at a price considerably below its real value. If the fine is paid immediately, only onethird of the quint can be demanded. The succession to fiefs is different from that of property held en roture, or by villainage. The eldest son takes by right the chateau or principal manorhouse, and the yard adjoining to it; also an acre of the garden joining to the manorhouse; If there are any mills, ovens, or presses, within the seigniory, they belong to the eldest son ; but the profits arising from the mills, (whether common or not), and from the ovens and press, if common, must be equally divided among the heirs. When there aire only two heirs coming to the succession, the eldest son takes, besides the manorhouse, &amp;c. two thirds of the fief; and the youngest son takes the other third : but when there are more than two heirs, the elder son takes the one half, and the other heirs take the remain-]  

CANADA.  Ping half. When there are only daughters coming to the succession, the fief is equally divided among them, the eldest daughter having no birthright. In successions to fiefs in the collateral line, females do not succeed with males in the same degree. If the eldest son dies, the next does not succeed to his birthright ; but the estate must be equally divided among the heirs. Franc aleu is a freehold estate, held subject to no seigniorial rights or duties, acknowledging no lord but the king. Censive is an estate held in the feudal manner, charged with a certain annual rent, which is paid by the possessor of it. It consists of money, fowls, or grain. It is thus that most of the Habitans hold their farms. The lods et ventes, or fines of alienation, are one twelfth part of the purchase money, and are paid by the purchaser on all mutations of property en roture (or soccage) to the seignior, in the same manner as the quint is paid upon mutations of fiefs. The seignior has also the same right of purchasing the property within 40 days, in case he suspects that there is any collusion between the parties to defraud him of his dues. The succession to estates held en roture is regulated differently from the successions to fiefs, that is to say, that the heirs all succeed equally to estates en roture. The seignior, whenever he finds it neccessary, may cut down timber for the purpose of building mills and making roads, which are considered of general benefit to his tenants. He is also allowed onetenth of all the fish caught on his property, besides an exclusive right to the profits of his gristmills, to which all his vassals are obliged to carry their corn, and pay a certain portion for the grinding it. Some of the rents paid by the Habitans to their seigniors, amount to 10 or 15 shillings per annum ; others pay no more than a sol, a capon, or a bushel of wheat. But from the lods et ventes, upon the sale of farms, the seigniors often derive from 50/. to 200/. or 3001. per annum ; even the barren seigniory of Grondines brought the seignior in one year upwards of 80/. Farms on good land will sell, according to their size, from 100/. to 500/. The Canadian government paid upwards of 500/. for a farm which they purchased for a certain individual, though it only consisted of 60 acres clear, and 20 acres wood land. The same was situated on the seigniory of Becancour, in the district of Three Rivers. Mr. Hart, the seignior, received between 40/. and 50/. from the government, as his lods et ventes. It will be perceived, by the practice of dividing the seigniories, fiefs, and farms, among the children of their proprietors, how much the power of the seigniors must be reduced, and the people involved in litiga-  tion and disputes. Hence the noblesse are now nearly reduced to the common mass of the vulgar, and the Habitans make but little progress towards the acquisition of property and power. 
With respect to the division of property in general, according to the civil law of Canada, it consists of moveable and immoveable property. Moveable property is any thing that can be moved without fraction. Immoveable property is any thing that cannot be moved, and is divided into two kinds, propres and acquits (acquisition.) Propre is an estate which is acquired by succession in the direct or collateral line ; and acquit is an estate or property that is acquired by any other means. Community of property is the partnership which huband and wife contract on marrying ; but they may stipulate in their marriagecontract, that there shall be no community of property between them. The dot, or dowry, is all the property which the wife puts into the community, whether moveable or immoveable. But immoveable property falling to her in a direct or collateral line, is a propre or real estate to her, and does not fall into the community. The dower is a certain right given to the wife by law, or by particular agreement ; it is of two kinds, the customary dower, and the stipulated dower. The former consists of half the property which the husband was possessed of at the time of their marriage, and half of all property which may come to him in a direct line. The stipulated dower is a certain sum of money, or portion of property, which the husband gives instead of the customary dower. The widow has only the use of the customary dower during her lifetime ; at her death it falls to the children, who did not accept the the succession of their father ; but her heirs succeed to the stipulated dower. Hence, by the community which exists in marriage, no man can dispose of any part of his properiy without the consent of his wife ; and some compensation or present is generally made to the lady on those occasions. A gentleman, it is well known, was once nearly prevented from purchasing a house, had not the fortunate interference of a quartercask of Madeira, and a piece of fine Russia sheeting, created a considerable change in the sentiments of his lady. 
The custom of allowing community of property in mariages has frequently proved injurious to the survivor. If the wife died without a will, the children, when of age, would demand their mother's share; and it has often happened that the father has been obliged to sell off all his property, in order to ascertain its value, and divide it among ]   270  

CANADA.  
[the claimants. The loss of a good business, or an estate, has sometimes been the consequence of this law. The parents now get wiser, and make wills which regulate the disposal of their property agreeable to the wishes of the survivor. The law of dowers has also given rise frequently to fraud. Some of the Canadians have opened a store with goods purchased on credit, and made over, perhaps, onehalf to the wife as her dower ; they have then failed, and their creditors have lost their money. Some alterations and improvements have, however, been introduced of late, which render collusion, in such cases, less practicable. No property in LoAver Canada is secure to the purchaser, unless advertised and sold by the sheriff, which clears it from all incumbrances and afterclaims. Sometimes a written agreement is entered into between the buyer and seller, in which the latter exonerates the former from all claims upon the property ; but this is far from being safe, and is relying wholly upon the honour of another ; for the buildings, lands, &amp;c. may be seized by the creditors of the estate, even though it might have passed through 20 private sales since the debts were contracted. The sale of property advertised by the sheriff, may be delayed by an opposition put in for the wife's dower, or on account of an illegal seizure. The power of arrests in Canada is limited. If an affidavit is made, that a man is about to leave the province in debt, for a sum exceeding 10/. sterling, the debtor may be arrested, and detained in prison until the debt is paid. But if he will swear that he is not worth 10 1, sterling, the court will order the creditor to pay him five shillings currency per week. 
From the foregoing sketch of Canadian jurisprudence, it may be easily conceived how puzzling and intricate some parts of the civil law must prove, and how much the Habitans are exposed and laid open to oppression from their seigniors, under the feudal tenures. This subject was formerly canvassed in the provincial assembly by some of the English members, who were for having proper bounds fixed to the power of the seigniors, and having all the fines and services due from their vassals accurately ascertained, and made generally known. But the French members, who had a great majority in the house, strongly opposed it, and the subject was dropped. Instances of oppression on the part of the seigniors are, however, fortunately very rare, and the Habitans enjoy their property quiet and unmolested ; yet, in case of violent outrage, they can always come under the protecting power of the British laws, which will afford them that security of which  their own are destitute. The Canadians have no reason to complain of the change of government. Before the conquest, they were often unacquainted with that protection which the laws now afford them. 
The lawyers who practise in Lower Canada are nearly all French ; not more than onefifth at most are English. They are styled advocates, and in the double capacity of counsellor and attorney : formerly they included the profession of notary public ; but that is now separated from the rest, and forms a distinct profession. Lawsuits are numerous, and are daily increasing, as may be ascertained by the duties upon them, for the purpose of erecting the new courthouse at Quebec. In 1800 this tax produced 500/. per annum; and in 1807 it had increased nearly to 1000/. per annum. The duty is now discontinued, as the object for which it was levied is accomplished. The building cost about 5000/. currency. 11. List of Governors of Canada, from the conquest, with the dale of their appointments.

Exclusive of the expences for the civil establishment of Lower Canada, which are chiefly defrayed by the province, the British government is at considerable expence for the maintenance of the English clergy, the distribution of presents to the Indians, and the military force and fortifications requisite for the security of the colony. The actual sum expended by Great Britain annually, on account of the two provinces, may be estimated at about 500,000/. sterling. It must, however, be observed, that the expences of the colony are always in a fluctuating state, in consequence of the increase or diminution of the military force, and the extraordinary repairs of fortifications. The expences of the civil government in Upper Canada are defrayed by direct taxe's : by duties upon articles imported from the United States; and a sum granted by the Lower province out of certain duties. In Upper Canada, lands, houses, and mills ; horses, cows, pigs, and other property, are valued, and taxed at the rate of Id. in the pound. Woodlands are valued at Is. per acre, and cultivated lands at 50s. per acre. A house with only one chimney pays no tax, but with two it is charged at the rate of 40/. per annum, though it may be but a mere hovel. The inhabitants of Lower Canada pay no direct taxes, except for the repair of roads, highways, paving streets, &amp;c. and then they have the choice of working themselves, or sending one of their labourers with a horse and cart, &amp;c. The revenue is raised, as stated in the table of receipts and expences. The French Canadians are very averse to taxation in a direct way, and much opposition is always experienced from the French members of the house of assembly whenever any proposition, however beneficial, may be offered which involves a direct cess. The utility of turnpikes has often been agitated in the provincial, parliament, and though the country would be greatly improved by the'opening of new roads and communications with distant settlements, yet the measure has always been violently opposed by the French party. The communication between Canada and the United States, by the way of lake Charnplain, is extremely difficult'; the roads are execrable, and will never be improved until turnpikes are established upon them. A very considerable trade is carried on between the two countries, and would increase with the facility of communication. The ignorance and obstinacy, how-]

[ever, of several of the French members, have hitherto baffled the more enlarged and liberal views of the JBritish merchants, who are ever desirous of affording the utmost facility to trade and commerce. 
J 4. Commerce. — The commerce of Canada, previous to the conquest of the country by the English, wastrifling and unimportant, and the balance of trade considerably against the colony. It is only within the last SO years that it has become of sufficient magnitude to claim the attention of enterprising individuals, and to be of political importance to the mothercountry. It was, perhaps, an unfortunate circumstance for Canada that it was colonized by the French, who are a people little qualified for agriculture, and less for commerce. Their flighty and volatile imaginations having been checked by the disappointment of not discovering gold or silver mines, by which they had promised themselves the immediate possession of immense riches, they could ill brook a residence in such a dreary country, where the ground was covered onehalf the year with snow. Agriculture with them was a matter of necessity rather, than of choice, and it is possible that they were very ignorant of that art. The first settlers being composed chiefly of soldiers, and men of a roving and adventurous spirit, very steady or regular habits could not be expected from them. The chase, therefore, offered greater charms than the slow and tedious process of agrir culture ; and few could be found who did not prefer the gun to the plough. The produce of the chase not only supplied them with provisions, but also with clothing; and in a short time the peltry which they procured in their excursions, came to be estimated at its proper value, and afforded them a very profitable article for exportation to the mothercountry. The forests, independent of their animal productions, abounded with inexhaustible quantities of valuable timber ; and the seas, rivers, and lakes, were equally abundant in every species and variety of fish. Thesearticles, with a few other natural productions, formed the only source of trade in the colony for nearly a century and a half, and they were far from being equivalent to the demands of the colonists, who imported from France more than double the amount of their exports, by which means their expences greatly exceeded their incomes, and reduced the credit of the colony to a very fow ebb. 
A variety of expedients were proposed and adopted to remedy this defect; among the rest was the issuing of papermoney, which in a few years accumulated so rapidly, that scarcely any coin was to be found in the country. French  sols, consisting ofbrass and a very small mixture of silver, which passed for rather less than Id. were all that was circulated. The papercurrency having no stability in itself, in consequence of its payment being protracted from year to year, fell at length into disrepute, and at the period of the conquest, more than 200,000/. were due to the colony by the French nation, on account of bills of exchange and paper currency: This sum was afterwards liquidated by France, through the interference of Great Britain ; bat the colonists sustained a very considerable loss. An extensive trade is now carried on between Canada and the United States across lake Champlain. The importations into Lower Canada consist of various articles of merchandise, oak and pine timber, staves, &amp;c. and pearl ashes, provisions, &amp;c. ; and amounted in 1807 to upwards of 160,000/. sterling. The exports from Lower Canada to the United States do not amount to half the value of the imports. They consist chiefly of peltry and salt : the other articles are of a trifling nature. The balance is therefore greatly in favour of the States, which receive the difference in specie. When the first embargo law took place, it did not affect those states bordering on Canada ; but in order to put all the states upon a level, the American government passed several supplementary acts, strictly prohibiting all trade and commerce with foreign places. The impolicy of such a measure, and the detriment likely to accrue to the newlysettled states on the confines of Canada, were abiy set forth by the inhabitants of the town of Burlington in Vermont, in their memorial to congress, praying a repeal of that part of the law which related to their state. 
Several Americans have of late years settled in Montreal, and carry on a lucrative trade through - oxit the country ; nor do the merchants of that place eye the exertions of the newcomers with jealousy : on the contrary, the latter have experienced a very hospitable and kind reception from them. One great cause of the want of spirit and enterprise among the Habitans, or Canadian landholders, who, generally speaking, are possessed of considerable property, is occasioned by the restrictions of their priests, who will not permit them to put their money out to interest. They have no other mode of turning their money to account, but by increasing their landed property, or, if in trade, by increasing their stock. Hence whatever profits and gains they are able to lay up must be put into a strong box, if they wish to secure it.]  CANADA.  [The merchants of Canada are almost wholly British : they derive their resources from England, and in general have established themselves upon small capitals and large credits. This may perhaps, in some measure, account for the numerous failures that have taken place amongst them ; and it is positively asserted as a fact, that since the country has been in our possession not more than five in 100 have paid their debts. A variety of causes, no doubt, have contributed to this extraordinary defalcation : a tedious winter of six months, during which no business can be carried on with Europe, while interest upon their European debts is charged after a certain period, and continues winter as well as summer, is certainly a great drawback in mercantile concerns ; the long credit also which the Canadian merchants are obliged to give the country storekeepers, tends very considerably to impede their remittances in due season, unless the utmost regularity is maintained. The timber and staves, which are brought into Canada from the states, are cut down in winter or spring, and collected into large rafts on lake Champlain, from whence they are floated down the river Richlieu into the St. Lawrence, and deposited along the shores of Silleri and Wolfe's cove, for an extent of more than five miles. There they are sorted for the merchants, and then taken into the ships which lie off" the cove, or at the wharfs at Quebec. Standardstaves of 5f feet long, If inch thick, and 5 inches broad, sell in Canada usually from 40/. to 50/. the 1200. The freight is about the same amount. The rafts when coming down the river exhibit a curious scene : they have several little sheds or huts erected with boards for the accommodation of the rowers, whose number on large rafts frequently consists of upwards of 100 or 150. The men employed in this business are chiefly Americans from the state of Vermont : they live upon the rafts until they are separated for sale, when they remove their huts to the shore, where they reside during the remainder of the season ; at the end of which they return home. Several rafts of timber, and scows laden with staves, flour, pork, and potash, arrive annually from Upper Canada at Montreal and Quebec. The trade between the Upper and Lower provinces has been important only within a very few years. The rapid increase of population and agriculture in the new settlements of Upper Canada, has produced a large surplus of those articles for exportation, and the demand for them has risen in proportion. 
The following is a return of the productions that passed the rapids from Chateauguay to Mont-  real between the 37th of April, and the 28th of November, 1807, the only period in which the St. Lawrence is navigable during the year.

Some persons consider Upper Canada as the garden of America, subjected neither to the tedious freezing winters of Lower Canada, nor the scorching summers of the more southern parts of the continent of N. America. The principal inconveniences to which the Upper province is subject, are the falls and rapids which impede the navigation of the St. Lawrence between Kingston and Montreal, and its distance from any commercial or shipping town from whence its productions may be exported to Europe. These are, however, in some measure removed, and a«considerable abundance of the surplus produce of that province is now forwarded to Montreal and Quebec. If good roads were made between the two provinces, regular waggons might be established as in England, and goods conveyed up the country with more security and expedition than they can at present by water ; a more regular communication would be then opened between the two seats of government, which would be the means of expediting the public business, and facilitating the commerce of both countries. The manufactures of Lower Canada are carried on chiefly by individuals for their own domestic use. A manufactory of iron was established by the French at Three Rivers, soon after the settlement of the country. That government, however, was never able to make it pay the expences attending the work, and it fell into the hands of individuals, who succeeded very little better. The iron ore was at one time supposed to be nearly exhausted, but fresh veins having been discovered in the vicinity of the forges, the works are now in a flourishing condition. Another manufactory of iron has been established of late in the seigniory of Batiscan, about halfway between Quebec and Three Rivers, on the n. shore. Large sums of money have been expended in endeavouring to bring these works to perfection ; but very little]

£success lias bitherto attended the exertions of the proprietors, several of whom are considerable losers. The articles manufactured here consist of castiron stoveplates, pots, kettles, and other domestic utensils. Within the last twenty years, shipbuilding has been carried on at Quebec and Montreal to a very profitable extent every year. There are four builders at the former place, and one at the latter ; from six to eight vessels are launched annually : they range between 200 and 500 tons, and are contracted for upon an average at 10/. per ton. The greatest advantage of this business is, that the men can Avork at it both winter and summer. The cordage and rigging are obtained from England, but the ironwork is mostly of Canadian manufacture ; nearly 20,000/. is annually circulated in the country for shipbuilding. Upon a review of the preceding account of the commerce of Canada it appears, that a very sensible improvement has taken place ^within the last twenty years ; and that the balance of trade, upon the whole, is now much in favour of the colony. It may be also worthy of remark, that the imports from Great Britain and her colonies, instead of increasing, have considerably diminished. For several years past, the E. India and British manufactured goods imported into Canada annually from Great Britain, have been estimated at about 330,000/. sterling ; but during the year 1807, they did not amount to more than 200,000/. : this surprising diminution, while the demands of the colony were increasing with its population, must naturally create astonishment, until it is known that the deficiency is supplied by the United States, partly by a regular trade, but much more by contraband. The articles now furnished chiefly by the Americans, and which were formerly procured solely from England, are tea, tobacco, and E. India manufactured goods. By the table of imports received at the customhouse at St. John's, on lake Champlain, it appears that in 1807, 42,000 lbs. of tea, 187,887 lbs. of tobacco, and merchandise consisting of British and E. India goods to the amount of 30,000/. were imported from the United States through the regular channel; while the quantity of tea received from England was only 4200 lbs. and tobacco 150,000 lbs : that exclusive of timber, potash, and provisions, the total amount was calculated at 100,000/. equal to one half the merchandise received that year from Great Britain. Reckoning even upon this estimate, the deficiency of imports from Great Britain appears to be accounted for ; but then no allowance is made for the increasing wants of the people, whose number must have greatly increased within the last twenty years ; this, however, is to be found in the great latitude that is  given to the introduction of goods from the United States, without passing through the customhouse at St. John's. The means of conveying them into Canada, across the extensive boundary line, which divides the two countries, are so easy, and require so little exertion to avoid the Argus eyes of a customhouse officer, that every temptation is offered to introduce articles which are either prohibited, or pay any considerable duty. The facilities afforded to smuggling between Canada and the United States, have been sufficiently exemplified since the promulgation of the embargo act ; for, in spite of the armed militia and customhouse officers stationed along the American side of the line to enforce the laws, the timber, potash, provisions, and almost every other article brought into the province in 1808, has more than doubled the quantity received from thence in 1807. A variety of curious expedients were resorted to by the Americans in smuggling their produce over the line ; buildingswere erected exactly upon the boundary line, one half in Canada, the other half in the States ; the goods were put in at night, and before morning were safe in Canada. Additional laws, however, put a stop to this proceeding, and the officers were empowered to seize all property which they suspected was intended to be run into Canada ; but the ingenuity of the Vermontese still evaded even these rigorous mandates. They constructed a great number of timber rafts, fastened tbem together, and formed immense bodies of floating wood ; one of them even covered ten acres, and from its size, and in ridicule of Mr. Jefferson, was called the Mammoth raft. These were manned wholly by French Canadians collected for that purpose, and were rowed within a short distance of the line ; when the customhouse officers, aided by a detachment of the militia, immediately took possession, and obliged the people on board to cast anchor ; this was accordingly complied with, and for a few days the rafts remained quietly moored. There were immense quantities of provisions, potash, and staves on board ; and the people were conveniently lodged in their wooden huts, which, with the great number of men employed to row them, formed a very extraordinary spectacle. It was not long, however, before the whole were soon in action again ; for a violent gale of wind coming on one night, blew the unweildly rafts, with all their civil and military heroes on board, completely over the line. The American officers and militia no sooner found themselves in Canada, than they hastily took to their boats and rowed back to the States, sorely chagrined at losing so many valuable prizes. Strong remonstrances were made by the commanding ofhcers on]  

CANADA  
[these expeditions, and information was sent to Mr. President Jefferson, who at length was pleased to issue a proclamation declaring the inhabitants of Vermont to be in a state of rebellion and insurrection ; and ordered outreinforcementsofthe militia to quell the disturbances. The Vermontese were much enraged at the idea of being considered and denounced as rebels, in consequence of a few frays between the customhouse officers and smugglers. A great and serious inconvenience was felt at this period by the British settlers in Missisqui bay, the entrance from which into lake Champlain is cut by the boundary line, and several rafts were thus prevented from passing down the Richlieu river into the St. Lawrence ; they having no outlet but by way of the States. The lucrative trade, which is carried on between Canada and the adjoining States, has rendered the Americans very averse to a war between the two countries, as the prosperity of their respective States almost entirely depend upon that opening for the disposal of their surplus produce. Greater facility and advantages are afforded by the exportation to Canada than to any of the maritime towns in New England ; nothing, therefore, but absolute necessity would drive them into a war with the British settlements. They also lay a duty of nearly 15 per cent, on goods from Canada, while their productions sent into that country pay but a mere trifle. The Canadians are more inclined to encourage the importation of goods from the States than from Great Britain, because they are obtained at a much cheaper rate, though generally of an inferior quality. The intrinsic worth of an article is, however, of less consideration to the inhabitants of Canada than the price ; the best kind are seldom or never to be procured in that country : the merchants find their own advantage in the vending of inferior commodities, upon which they obtain much larger profits than they could procure upon the better sort ; and the people are now so accustomed to the use of these goods, that they scarcely know how to appreciate those of a superior quality. Much diversity of opinion has existed of late in Canada, upon the propriety of establishing a bank in that country : the British merchants of course are eager for the creation of such an establishment, having before their eyes the example of Great Britain and the United States, where the banking system is carried on with so much success and advantage. The subject was discussed in 1808, in the house of assembly, and Mr. Richardson of Montreal, one of the members, answered the several objections that were urged against the establishment of a bank in Lower Canada. A bill was then brought into the house ; the following are its prin-   cipal features: — The stock is not to,exceed 250,000/. currency, unless the government of the province see fit to take an interest therein, in which case it may be 50,000/. more. This stock is to consist of shares of 251. each. There are to be 24 directors, who are to choose out of their number a president and vicepresident, whereof half are to be for Quebec, and half for Montreal, at which cities the two superior branches of the bank are to be held, with a power of erecting offices of deposit and discount in other parts of the Canadas advisable. If government take an interest, they are to appoint two directors. The dividends are to be payable halfyearly. A deposit of 10 per cent, is to be paid down for each share on subscribing, which will be forefeited if the first instalment thereafter of 10 per cent, be not paid in due season. The shares are put at a low rate, that they may be more generally diffused over the province. Foreigners may hold shares, but cannot be directors ; they may, however, vote at general meetings by proxy, if the proxy be one of his Majesty's subjects. The votes are endeavoured to be established on such a scale of proportion as shall exclude an overbearing preponderance in those who shall hold a large interest in the concern, and yet assure to property therein that influence which it ought to possess in every well regulated institution. It is proposed that there shall be no other corporate bank in Canada during the continuance of the contemplated one ; but there is a power of revocation thereof, under certain limiMions and formalities, if found to be hurtful in practice. The stock of the bank may be increased when requisite, and its notes are proposed to be receivable in payment of duties imposed on, or to be imposed by the provincial legislature. It is doubtful whether the French party in the house of assembly will coincide with the ideas of the British merchants ; the old French paper currency is not yet forgotten, and will naturally prejudice a great many of them against the introduction of a similar medium. The numerous gangs of forgers who infest the boundary line, and counterfeit immense quantities of the United States' papermoney, and the innumerable paltry notes for a few cents or halfdollars, which are in circulation all over the Northern States, are certainly no great inducements to create a similar establishment in Canada, which would most likely give rise to the same evils. In short, it involves considerations of a very serious nature ; what may suit Great Britain and the United States, may not answer in Canada, and the mischievous effects of a paper medium have already been felt in that province; though it must be allowed that the colony is at pre-]   HU(«  CANADA.  
[sent in a better condition for the establishing of a For a secure place of deposit for the people's bank than at any former period ; the balance of money, which is now locked up in their chests, it trade upon the aggregate being greatly in its favour, would also be of considerable utility.

[In 1769, and for several years subsequent, the principal articles of export consisted of peltry, lumber, oil, and fish, with a small quantity of ginseng and capillaire : these were shipped from Quebec, Labrador, and Gaspe. Within the last twenty years new staples have arisen, which have been exported to very large amounts, and promise to enrich the country equally with the fur trade; These articles are wheat, biscuit, and flour, pot and pearl ashes ; which in 1807 amounted to onehalf the total exports of 1797. It must be allowed, however, that considerable quantities of pot and pearl ash are brought into Canada by the Americans from the United States ; yet the clearing of the lands in Upper Canada, and the back settlements of the Lower Province, produce annually a much greater quantity than what is obtained from the States. The French Canadians, within these two or three years, have begun to make ashes ; they have seen the facility with which their brethren of the United States clear their lands and pay their expences • and though late, yet are willing to profit by the example. Their poverty or parsimony had prevented them from paying 2(W. for a potash kettle, though they might, like the Americans, have made the salts in smaller quantities, and with little trouble or expence. But it requires a series of years to effect a change in the sentiments or actions of the French Habitans. The great demand for wheat which prevailed in Great Britain, and generally throughout Europe, in 1795-4 ar.d 5. gave a sudden stimulus to the exertions of the Canadians, who during those years exported considerable quantities of wheat, as well as flour and biscuit. The increased price given for those articles tempted the inhabitants to continue as large a cultivation of grain in the subsequent years ; but the demand declining, they experienced a sensible reduction in their exports, and a consequent curtailment of their The following statement will exhibit the fluctuating demand for wheat, biscuit, and flour, from 1796 to 1808.

The unsettled state of the market for the above articles renders it necessary to establish some other, of a more permanent nature, which might also be derived from agriculture, and would be the means of enriching the mother country as well as the colony. The only article which could effectually supply this want is hemp, and that alone,  if cultivated to a sufficient extent, would be more than adequate to meet the whole expence of the imports. The quantity of wheat exported in 1802 was unusually great, being 1,010,033 bushels; but in 1807 it had fallen to less than a fourth of that quantity, and in 1808 to less than a fifth : yet the general aggregate of the exports has augmented, as well as the number of ships and seamen. The exportation of almost every other article in 1808 greatly exceeded that of the preceding year, in consequence of the embargo in the United States. The number of shipping that cleared out from Quebec in 1808 amounted to 334, and were laden principally with timber, potash, pitch, tar, and turpentine ; wheat, flaxseeds, staves, &amp;c. The tonnage was 70,275, and the number of seamen 3330, The greatest part of these vessels were sent by government, the usual supplies from the Baltic being in a great measure cut off by the war with Russia and Denmark, and the importations from the United States being totally stopped by the embargo. The advantage, therefore, of Great Britain deriving her supplies of hemp, as well as every other description of naval stores, from Canada, cannot for a moment be doubted. Even in time of peace, they would encourage and enrich the British colonists, and the competition in the market with the productions of the United States, and the n. parts of Europe, would inevitably tend to lessen the expences of our navy and commercial marine. The account of the exports and imports of Canada for the year 1810, will doubtlessly afford the highest gratification to our readers, to see the great increase of the trade of that colony.

In the preceding account, the exports from Canada to the United States, via St. John's, and the exports from the departments of Gaspe, and the bay of Chaleurs, are not included. 
Imports, 1810. — Among the articles included under this head, we observe the increasing importations direct from Spain and Portugal, and other parts of Europe south of cape Finisterre to Canada. We trust this new branch of the British North American trade will soon be put under such judicious regulations as will give the colonies the benefit intended by the legislature in this deviation from the colonial system. We are, however, sorry to observe, that every facility which might be afforded to the export trade of Canada has not yet been granted. We understand a committee has been appointed by congress, to ascertain whether the produce of the countries on the borders of rivers and lakes which have their outlet to the sea by the river St. Lawrence, and which are extremely fertile, can be brought down any of the rivers within the United States to their Atlantic ports, for shipment in American vessels.

It may be remarked, that in the furtherance of this trade, no specie is sent out of the country, the returns being nearly all made in British produce and manufactures, and the difference either left here with the correspondents of the colonists, or invested in the public, funds. The employment which is thus afforded to British ships and British seamen, and the advantages which must result to the traders and manufacturers of the country, and to the various useful classes connected with shipbuilding, from such employment of our own shipping, cannot fail to excite astonisment in the minds of the most indifferent and inattentive observers, that these colonies should have been so long considered possessions of little value or importance, and that we at last resorted to them from necessity. Indeed, we have to thank the northern powers of Europe, and the government of the United States, for having opened our eyes, and directed our attention So these invaluable appendages of the British empire.

The unusual demand for the natural productions of Canada during 1808 enhanced the price of every article in proportion ; and in spite of the embargo laws, abundance of timber and staves, pot and pearl ashes, and provisions of every description, found their way across the boundary line into Canada, and were shipped off to Europe, or the West Indies. The Canadian merchants rejoiced at the embargo, which enriched them while it made their neighbours poor indeed. The arrival of Sir James Craig diffused new life and activity through the province : the imbecility and irresolution which before characterised the government, instantly vanished ; large sums of money were circulated by the troops, and the construction of new works, with the repairs of the old, gave full employment to the labouring part of the community ; the price of provisions became proportionately enhanced, chiefly at Quebec, where an unusual number of seamen and soldiers had taken up their residence : hence the country people were enriched, and encouraged to greater exertions. The price of every thing has been nearly trebled within the last 60 years ; but the colony has risen into importance : agriculture and commerce continue to im-] o o   282

[prove and augment ; many of its inhabitants possess handsome fortunes, and nearly all of them a moderate independence or income from trade. 
16. Fur Trade. — The fur trade has been the principal source of all the wealth which has for many years been accumulated in the province. This branch of commerce, which fell into the hands of the English after the conquest, was carried on for several years by individuals, on their own separate account ; but about 27 years ago, the enterprising and active spirit of a Mr. M'Tavisli laid the foundation of that association at present known under the title of the Northwest Company, for the purpose of extending that trade to its utmost limits. This was more likely to be accomplished by the joint stock of a company than the small properties of individual merchants, and the result has justified the expectations of its author. Much jealousy and competition was, however, excited by those northwest traders who did not associate with Mr. M'Tavish and his friends, and for several years the greatest animosity subsisted between them. This opposition naturally gave rise to a seeond company, consisting of the individuals opposed to Mr. M'Tavish. Among the most conspicuous of the second association was Mr. M'Kenzie, now Sir Alexander. The enterprising spirit of this gentleman is well known, since the publication of his Travels across the Northwest Continent to the Pacific Ocean. The concerns of his company were, we find, managed with as much ability as the other, which made their opponents seriously wish to combine the two associations in one ; but the high spirit of Mr. M'Tavish would not allow it : he resolutely withstood all attempts at an accommodation, and spared neither expence nor trouble to crush the exertions of his rivals. Death, however, which too often annihilates the fairest hopes of sublunary bliss, put an end to the contest ; Mr. M'Tavish died, the companies immediately joined their stocks, and commenced partnership, in which state they remain at this day; the business being conducted under the firm of M'Gillivray, Roderick M'Kenzie, and Co. though the number of persons who have shares in the company amount, it is said, to more than forty. The clerks, voyageurs, and Indians, employed by the northwest company, amount to upwards of 3000. The clerks are all adventurous young Scotchmen, who emigrate, from penury, in the islands of the Hebrides, to certain hardships and dubious affluence in the dreary wilds of the northwest. They engage for a term of five or seven years, after which they have a certain yearly allowance, or become part-  ners in the company. The hardships and fatigue which they undergo, frequently tend to the enervation of their frame, and the destruction of their health ; so that at the period of fifteen or twenty years, it is not uncommon for them to retire from the company, with a fortune of 20,000/. and a broken constitution. Of late years, the profits of the company have been considerably diminished by the restrictions on our commerce on the continent of Europe, where the chief demand for furs exists. Considerable quantities are, however, sent to the United States, from whence they are exported to Europe under their neutral flag ; an opening is thus created for the company's peltry, which would otherwise have been very much contracted during the war. The number of skins exported to England in 1807 was 460,000, and to the United States 286,703 ; but the embargo in 1808 must have much lessened the demand from that quarter. Upwards of 20,000/. is annually paid in England for the duties on furs from Canada. The capital employed by the northwest company must be very extensive, as the returns areextremey slow. The trade is now pushed to the very extremity of the continent, from the coast of Labrador to the Pacific ocean, extending to the northward beyond the arctic circle. The goods sent up annually from Montreal, for the barter of furs from the Indians, are upwards of four years before they produce a return. The dangers and difficulties attending the transportation of these articles so many thousand miles across rivers, lakes, and portages, have been well described by Sir Alexander M'Kenzie in his History of the Furtrade. The same wellinformed writer observes, that the articles necessary for this trade " are, coarse woollen cloths of different kinds ; milled blankets of different sizes ; arms and ammunition ; twist and carrot tobacco ; Manchester goods ; linens and coarse sheetings ; thread, lines, and twine ; common hardware ; cutlery and ironmongery of several descriptions ; kettles of brass and copper, and sheet iron ; silk and cotton handkerchiefs ; hats, shoes, and hose ; calicoes and printed cottons, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Spirituous liquors and provisions are purchased in Canada. These, and the expence of transport to and from the Indian territory, including wages to clerks, interpreters, guides, and canoemen, with the expence of making up goods for the market, form about half the annual amount against the adventure." The necessary number of canoes being purchased at about 300 livres each, the goods formed into packages, and the lakes and rivers being free of ice, (which they usually are in the beginning of May), they are then dispatched from]   CAN  

CAN  [La Chine, eight miles above Montreal, 'with eight or ten men in each canoe, their baggage, and 65 packages of goods, six cwt. of biscuit, two cwt. of pork, three bushels of pease, for the men's provision, two oilcloths to cover the goods, a sail, &amp;c. an axe, a towingline, a kettle, and a sponge tobail out tiie Avater, with a quantity of gum, bark, and watape, to repair the vessel. The voyagers are frequently obliged to unload their canoes, and carry their goods upon their backs, or rather suspended in slings from their heads ; and this they call a decharge. In the same case each man's load is two packages, though some carry three, and the canoe is towed by a strong line. There are some places where the ground will not admit of their carrying the whole : they then make two trips ; that is, leave half their lading, and go and land it at the distance required, and then return for that which was left. In some places both goods and canoes are transported, and this is denominated a portage. But there is another association established within these few years, called the Southwest or Michillimakinak Company ; some of the partners in this association have also shares in the northwest company, but the general concern is totally separate. The southwest merchants pursue their trade across the lakes Ontario and Erie, and down the rivers Illinois, Ohio, and Mississippi, in the territory of the United States. In consequence of the embargo which has lately taken place in the United States, and which it was apprehended would affect the concerns of this company, one of the partners^ Mr. Gillespie, went to Washington, to procure from the government a safe conduct for their people and property employed in the trade. He was assured by Mr. Maddison, that no interruption whatever should take place in the prosecution of their trade with the Indians in the United States territory ; and a clause was inserted to that effect in the supplementary embargo act. Upon the return of Mr. Gillespie to Montreal, the people with the boats, laden with the property for trade belonging to the company, were accordingly sent off on their usual voyage. On the 21st of May, the first five boats arrived within the American limits on lake Ontario ; they were hailed from the shore by order of the commandant of Niagara ; but having no business at that place, the boats continued their route, when they were immediately fired upon by the Americans. Three of the advanced boats pulled up and escaped ; the other two were brought to, and taken by the Americans, who, finding there were several more astern, embarked in an armed boat, went in search of them, and captured five more, which they car-  lied to Niagara. They then sailed after the remainder ; but information being given by a gentleman, who immediately armed a boat, and went to inform them of their danger, the brigade put about for Kingston, where they arrived in safety, having been chased for two days by the American armed boats. 
17. General History. — This country was disco' vered by the English as early as about 1497, and settled by the French in 1608, who kept possession of it till 1760, when it was taken by the British arms ; and at the treaty of Paris in 1763, was ceded by France to the crown of England, to whom it has ever since belonged. One of the most remarkable accidents which history records of this country, is the earthquake in the year 1663, which overwhelmed a chain of mountains of freestone more than 300 miles long, and changed the immense tract into a plain. See British America, and Britain, New, for further particulars concerning this country.]

In this township, on the bank of the Mohawk, about 50 miles from Schenectady, is Indian castle, so called, the seat of old King Hendrick, who was killed in Sept. 1755, at lake George, fighting for the British and Americans against the French. Here are now the remains of a British fort, built during that war, about 60 paces square. A gold coin, of the value of about seven dollars, was found in these ruins in 1793. About a mile and a half w. of this fort stands a church, which is called Brandt's church, which the noted chief of that name is said to have left with great reluctance. This was the principal seat of the Mohawk nation of Indians, and abounds with appletrees of thenplanting, from which is made cider of an excellent quality.]

[==[[Cananea|CANANDAQUA]]==, a posttown, lake, and creek, in Ontario county, New York. It is the shire town of the county, situated on the n. end of the lake of the same name, at its outlet into Canandaqua creek. The lake is about 20 miles long, and three broad, and sends its waters in a ». e. and e. course 35 miles to Seneca river. This is the site of an ancient Indian town of the same name, and stands on the road from Albany to Niagara, 22 miles e. from Hartford in Genessee river ; 16 miles w. of Geneva, and 235 miles n. w. from New York city, measuring in a straight line, and 340 by Albany road. This settlement was begun by Messrs. Gorham and Phelps, and is now in a flourishing state. There are about 30 or 40 houses, situated on a pleasant slope from the lake ; and the adjoining farms are under good cultivation. By the state census of 1796, it appears there are 291 electors in this township.] 
==[[Canapote|CANAPOTE]]==, Cienega de, a settlement of the province and government of Cartagena in the kingdom of Tierra Firme : it takes the name of Cienega from being situate near a quagmire : it abounds with fish, with which it provides the capital : in the time of the Indians its population and commerce were very considerable. It was discovered by the Governor Don Pedro de Heredia in the year 1535, and conquered after a very long and severe struggle ; it is now reduced to a very miserable village.

[CANCES are a very numerous Indian nation of N. America, consisting of a great many different tribes, occupying different parts of the country from the bay of St. Bernard, in the gulf of Mexico, across the Rio Grande del Norte, and towards La Vera Cruz. They are not friendly to the Spaniards, and generally kill them when th'ey have an opportunity. They are attached to the French, are good hunters, principally using the bow. They are very particular in their dress, which is made of neatly dressed leather j the women wear a  

CAN  long loose robe, resembling that of a Franciscan friar ; nothing but their heads and feet are to be seen. The dress of the men consists of straight leather leggings resembling pantaloons, and a leather hunting shirt or frock. No estimate can be made of their number. Thirty or forty years ago, the Spaniards used to make slaves of them when they could take them ; a considerable number of them were brought to Nachitoches, and sold to the French inhabitants at 40 or 50 dollars a head, and a number of them are still living here, but are now free. About 20 years ago, an order came from the king of Spain that no more Indians should be made slaves, and those that were enslaved should be emancipated ; after which, some of the women w'io hud been servants in good families, and taught spinning, sewing, &amp;c. as well as managing household affairs, married natives of the country, and became respectable, wellbehaved women, and have now growing up, decent families of children ; have a language peculiar to themselves, and are understood, by signs, by all others. They are in amity with all other Indians except the Hietans.]

==[[Canelos|CANELOS]]==, a large province of the kingdom of Quito, discovered by Gonzalo Pizarro in the year 1540, who gave it this name on account of the quantity of cinnamon trees found in it, which grow very strong, shedding an odour something like camphor, and very pungent. This cinnamon, which is called raspado, is carried to Quito, and sold at six reals a pound, being made use of instead of the fine cinnamon. A small viper is frequently met with in it of the same colour as the cinnamon, and extremely venomous. This province is uncultivated, full of impenetrable forests and rivers, and contains only one settlement of the same name, on the n. shore of the river Bobonaza, in which is the port ofCanoas, and the residence of a religious Dominican, who is the curate of those few miserable Indians. In lat. 1° 32' 20" s. 
CANES and Canches, a province and corregimknto of Peru, bounded on the e. by Carabaya, towards the town of Mauclani, on the s. e. by Lampa in the Cordillera of Villacanota, on the s. by Cailloma, s. e. by a part of the province of Condesuios of Arequipa, w. by Chumbivilca, being divided by the river Apurimac, and n. w. by Quispicanchi. It is in length from n. to s. 30 leagues, and 15 in width : Its climate is, for the greater part, extremely cold, on account of its being nearly covered with mountains of snow ; nevertheless they cultivate here barley, maize, potatoes, cavi, and quinoa; and in the warm parts, which consist of uneven and broken grounds near the rivers, some kinds of fruit, though in no abundance. Here also are great quantities of animals which breed upon the mountains from the luxuriance of the pastures ; and of these are the vigognes, huanacos, and viscachas, which latter are a species of hare or rabbit ; deer also, and partridges, abound here. In the rivers are found bagres a foot in length. The principal rivers which water this province, are the Vilcamayo, which runs from the province of Quispicanchi, into which runs another flowing down from the s»owy sierras on the e. part called Combapata.  
This river has a stone bridge, and descends from the heights of Cailloma. This province has many lakes, which are filled Avith waterfowl, such as ducks, widgeons, and others ; these birds are found more particularly in lake Lanchug, which is three leagues long and one and a half broad, and in it there is also found the loadstone. Linen cloth is fabricated here. In the district of San Pedro de Cacha, in a place called Rache, there is an ancient and grand edifice with nine gates, half of the walls of which, as high as the first stories, are made of carved stone ; the rest of the edifice being of earth upon five galleries of stone, forming as it were so many other walls. This building is said to have served as a temple in Viracocha in the time of the gentilism of the Indians. At a small distance there is an artificial lake with aqueducts which keep it always at a proper height ; this lake is situate upon a black mountain, which may be about two leagues in circumference : also in the same vicinity are vestiges of a considerable population, and here is found a mineral earth from which they fabricate jars, large pitchers, and other vessels, which are carried to be sold in the neighbouring provinces. In this province are many mines of silver, but they are not worked, on account of their jbeing some of them filled with water, and some of them broken in, with the exception, however, of those of Condoroma, which, although they have experienced the former calamity, do not fail to render yearly many marks of gold, a pretty good testimony of their riches. Great indeed have been the labour and expence in the attempts to empty them of the water, but in this they have not as yet succeeded. Here are also four good sugarmills ; and in the jurisdiction of the town of Yauri, are two mines of copper, which are worked : Some gold mines also are not wanting, although they be of little note. In the establishment of Condoroma it is not unusual to experience, in the tempests of thunder and lightning, a sort of prickly sensation on the hands and feet and other parts of the body, which they call moscas, or flies, without, however, being able to discover any of these insects ; and it should seem that the effect is to be attributed to the state of the atmosphere, since the heads' of canes, buckles, and silver or gold galloons, though during such times highly affected by the electric matter, cease to be so on the cessation of the tempest. The inhabitants of this province amount to 18,000 souls, dwelling in 24 settlements, which arc,

On the s. it gathers the waters of the San Pedro, Santa Cruz, and Arevalo, and on the n. those of the Lucia, Pato, Tango, Tabaquero, Cascabeles, Iscanze, and others of an inferior description. It divides itself into two arms, the one of which takes thenameofYupura, and which, running nearly to the same point as the Maranon, separates itself into other branches, which enter into this latter river in 4° of lat. and immediately become as large and considerable as if they were the main stream : the other arm is also divided into two, the one taking a n. e. course, and entering the Orinoco, and the other running s. e. and bearing the name of the Rio Negro ; by means of which, in the year 1744, some Portuguese came from Maranon to Orinoco, and proved the communication of these rivers, which before was doubted : also by one of the arms of the Yupura, Gonzalo Ximenes de Quesada found his way to the new kingdom of Granada when he undertook, its conquest. Some maintain that this river was the Orinoco, and thus has Don Pedro Maldonado represented it in his map published in the year 1750 ; but that of the Father Bernado Rosella, missionary of the abolished society of the Jesuits in Orinoco, made after the notes and instructions of the Father Manuel Roman, attributes with some confidence another origin to the Orinoco, and speaks of the Caqueta as one of the rivers which enter it on the w. side. The Spanish geographer Gruz, in his General Chart of America, makes no distinction between the Yupura and the Caqueta, and only speaks of one stream, which runs continually to the s.s. e. through the territory of the Cavauris Indians, before it enters the Maranon. He delineates the same as throwing out four branches to the w. and three to the e. all which join the latter river ; and he further states, that before it beqpmes thus divided, it forms on its n. side two large lakes called Ynabavu andCumapi; from the whole of which may be easily inferred how great is the abundance of its waters.

The whole of the lands lie low, and are uncultivated and full of wood ; the climate is hot and moist. It is at present united to the province of Esmeraldas.

It was situate in the bay of Cara, which is formed by the mouths of the" two rivers Tasagua and Chones : its ruins are still to be seen, and from these was built the settlement of Canoa, at six leagues distance, which was the residence of the lieutenant governor. This settlement was in 31/ s. lat.

==[[Carabaia|CARABAIA]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru, bounded on the e. by Larecaja, w. by Qnispicanchi, n. w. and n. by the territories of the infidel Indians, called Carangues, Sumachuanes, and others, who are separated by the famous river Inambary; s. w. by the province of Canes and Canches or Tinta, and s. byLampaand Asangaro, and in part by Puno or Paucarcolla. According to the nice measurements which were made with regard to this province as well as of the others, it is said to be 40 leagues from n. to .?. and 50 at the most from e. to w. Its furtherest limits are only 14 leagues distant from Cuzco, although on horseback it is necessary to go around of 60 leagues. Its climate is various^ according to the more or less elevated situation of the country ; so that it is in some parts very cold, and in others more temperate. The pastures are good, consequently there is no want of cattle, and in the neighbourhood of the Andes they gather three or four crops of coca in the year. In this province is included that called San Gaban, which was united to it; many settlements having been at the same time added to the provinces of Larecaja, Lampa and Asangaro. It has abounded more in gold than any other province  in America, and they reckon the gold it has produced at 33 millions of dollars, without counting that which has been concealed ; but at present they scarce procure from it 200 pound weight a year, on account of the increased charges of labour, and the want of energy in the inhabitants. Many lumps of gold have been found here, among which there is still remembered to have been one of the figure of a horse, which weighed 100 weight and some odd pounds, and which was carried to the Emperor Charles V. ; and likewise another lump which was sent to Philip II. bearing a resemblance to the head of a man, which, however, was lost together with much other riches in the channel of Bahama. This latter lump was found in the washing place of Ynahuaya. Nearly the whole of the territory of this province is interspered with gold- The most celebrated washing places that it had were called San Juan del Oro, Paulo Coya, Ananea, and that which was superior to all, Aporoma. In the year 1713, a lump of silver also was discovered in the mountain of Ucuntaya, being of a very solid piece of metal, and of prodigious value ; in its rivers are found sands of gold, to which at certain times of the year, the Indians have recourse, in order to pay their tributes. There are also other mines of silver and copper in various parts, and springs of hot water. It is very liable to earthquakes, and according to the tradition of the Indians, there was one which took place before the conquest, so large as to overturn mountains, and that, opening the earth, it swallowed up in an abyss many towns with their inhabitants. They likewise assert, that in the year 1747, another earthquake, throwing out of the ground a dirty and muddy water, thereby infected the rivers to such a degree as to cause a dreadful and general mortality. It has some large rivers as well as small ; all of which empty themselves into the Ynambari, thus rendering this river extremely abundant : towards the n. and n. e. which, as we have observed, is bounded by the infidel Indians, there are large tracts of ground covered with coca and rice, with an abundance of mountain fruits. In the aforesaid river they are accustomed to take shad and large dories by shooting them with muskets, or by piercing them with arrows or darts. There are also some lakes, which, although without fish, abound in ducks, snipes, and other aquatic fowl. The infidel Indians have made various irruptions into this province: its capital is Sandia, and its natives, who amount to 28,000, are divided into 26 settlements, as follows : The repartimiento received by the corregidor used to amount to 82,800 dollars, and it paid 662 yearly for alcavala.

11. Its streets. — The streets of Caracas, like those of many modern cities, are in parallel lines, about 20 feet broad, paved, and running n. s. e. and w.- The houses are well built, about 300 feet from each other. 
12. Public squares. — There are but three public squares deserving of the name, and these are not free from deformities. The great square, called Plaza Mayor, which ought to be the most regular, is deformed by booths built to the e. and w. which are let to shopkeepers for the profit of the city ; and for the trifling emolument thus derived, is sacrificed a most delightful prospect. This square occupies the same space as one of the gardens of the city, called Quadras* the size of which is about 300 square feet. The square is well paved, and in it is held a market, in which you might procure in abundance vegetables, fruits, fresh and salted meat, fish, poultry,game, bread, paroquets, and monkeys. The cathedral, which is situate on the e. side of the square, has no symmetrical connection with it. This square has on each side two entrances. The second square is that of the Candelaria, surrounded very regularly by an open palisade of iron upon stone work of an unequal height. This square, although not paved, has a soil of clay mixed with sand, which is as good as the best pavement, and altogether it does not fail to afford an agreeable coup d'ceil. It owes nothing to the buildings that compose it, nor is there, indeed, one fit to engage the attention, save the church of Candelaria, which, although not of perfect geometrical proportion, has a front which diverts the eye, and is by no means a disadvantage to the square. The third square is that of St. Paul : its only ornament is a fountain in its centre. The church of St. Paul is, indeed, at the s. e. angle, but has no other symmetrical relation with the square than that it forms a part of it. This square is neither paved nor even. The other squares are, \st, That of Trinidad, which has not even the form of a square, and the ground of which is extremely uneven and neglected : 2d, That of St. Hyacinth, containing the convent of the Dominicans, and bordered on the e. by the pavement of a street, and crossed by another, so as to induce a supposition that it was never intended for a square : 3d, That of St. Lazarus, which is a sort of inclosure before the church of that name, situate to the s. e. of the city ; it has the merit of neatness, but so detached from the town, that it does not appear to form a part of it :. kth, The square of Pastora, which is surrounded by  ruins : 5th, The square of St. John, which is spacious, but irregular,, unpaved, and bordered only on the w. side by a row of houses of mean construction. It is in this square that the mounted militia are exercised. 
13. Houses. — The houses of individuals are handsome and well built. There are a great number in the interior of the city, which consist of separate stories, and are of a very handsome appearance. Some are of brick, but the greater part are of masonry, made nearly after the manner of the Romans, and on the plan now adopted when building in marshes or in the sea, &amp;c. according to the method published by Mr. Tardiff in 1757. They make a sort of frame without a bottom, with planks of five feet long and three high, which becomes the model of the front of the Avail about to be erected. The ground on which they build serves as a foundation to this frame or support, and the frame is removed as each tier or part is added to complete the walls. They cover the walls with mortar, called in the country tapia. There are two sorts of this mortar : the first, to which they give the pompous name of royal tapia, is made of the sand of the river mixed with chalk, to which are frequently added flints, stones, and pebbles ; the second is composed of common sand with a very small quantity of chalk. A person easily distinguishes, by the mixture of these materials, that which is the most durable ; yet both acquire, by means of the pestle, a consistency which braves for a long time the inclemencies of the seasons and the effects of time. The outside of the houses, when made rough and whitened, appears equal to free stone. The timber of the roof is formed, as it were, into a double slope. The wood work is well joined, very elegant, and of an excellent description of wood, which the country furnishes in abundance. The houses of the principal people of the city, in general, are neatly and even richly furnished : they have handsome glasses, elegant curtains of crimson damask at the windows and at the inner doors ; chairs and sofas of wood, with the seats covered with leather or damask stuffed with hair, worked in a Gothic style, but overloaded with gilding ; beds, with the headboards raised very high, exposing to the sight nothing butgold, covered with handsome damask counterpanes, and several pillows of feathers covered with muslin cases ornamented with lace ; but there is seldom more than one bed of this magnificence in each house, and this is generally the nuptial bed, though being, in fact, merely kept for show. The feet of the tables and the commodes are richly gilt : elegant lustres are suspended in the principal apart-]   CARACAS.  
[merits ; the very cornices appear to have been dipped in gold, whilst superb carpets are spread over the part of the floor whereon the seats of honour are placed ; the furniture is arranged in the hall in such a manner that the sofa, which forms an essential part of it, stands at one end with chairs on the right and left, and opposite the principal bed in the house, which stands at the other extremity, in a chamber, the door of which is kept open, or is equally exposed to view in an alcove. These apartments, always very elegant and highly ornamented, are in a manner prohibited to those who inhabit the house : they are only opened, with a few exceptions, in honour of guests of superior rank. 
14. Public buildings. — The city of Caracas possesses no other public buildings than such as are dedicated to religion. The captaingeneral, the members of the royal audience, the intendant, and all the officers of the tribunal, occupy hired houses ; even the hospital for the troops is a private house. The contaduria, or treasury, is the only building belonging to the king, and its construction is far from bespeaking the majesty of its owner. It is not so with the barracks ; they are new, elegantly built, and situate in a spot where the sight breaks upon the city, and are two stories high, in which they can conveniently lodge 2000 men. They are occupied only by the troops of the line ; the militia having barracks of their own, consisting of a house, at the opposite part of the city. 
15. Archbishopric. — Caracas is the seat of the archbishopric of Venezuela, the diocese of which is very extensive, it being bounded on the n. by the sea, from the river Unare to the jurisdiction of Coro; on the e. by the province of Cumana, on the Orinoco, and on the w. by the bishopric of Merida. Caracas was erected into an archbishopric in 1803. The annual revenue of the archbishopric depends on the abundance of the harvests and the price of commodities, on which they take the tithes : these tithes are equally divided between the archbishopric, the chapter, the king, and the ministers of religion. The fourth part, belonging to the prelate, amounted on an average, before the war terminated by the treaty of Amiens, to 60,000 dollars per annum. The decrease of cultivation will for a long time prevent the episcopal revenues amounting to the above sum. Indeed the archbishop does not even enjoy the whole of this fourth part of the tithes, the king having reserved to himself the application of the third of this quarter, and charging upon it certain pensions.  
The seat of this  archbishopric was established at Coro in 1532, and translated to Caracas in 1636. 
16. Cathedral. — The cathedral church does not merit a description but from the rank it holds in the hierarchy ; not but that the interior is decorated with hangings and gilding, and that the sacerdotal robes and sacred vases are sufficiently splendid, but that its construction, its architecture, its dimensions, and its arrangements, are void of majesty and regularity. It is about 250 feet long and 75 broad ; it is low and supported in the interior by 24 pillars in four rows, which run the whole length of the cathedral. The two centre rows form the nave of the church, which is 25 feet broad ; the other two rows divide the aisles at equal distances of 12| feet, so that the nave alone is of the width of the two aisles, which are on its right and left. The chief altar, instead of being, like the Roman altars, in the centre, is placed against the wall. The choir occupies one half of the .nave, and the arrangement of the, church is such, that not more than 400 persons can see the officiating priest at whatever altar he may be - performing the service. The exterior does not evince any taste or skill in the architect ; the steeple alone, without having received any embellishment from art, has at least the merit of a boldness to which the cathedral has no pretensions. The only clock in Caracas is in this steeple ; it strikes the quarters, and keeps time pretty well. The humble architecture of the first church in Caracas springs from a source highly honourable to the inhabitants, and which we are therefore bound to relate : The episcopal chair having been translated from Coro to Caracas, (as we have before observed), in 1636, there was no necessity until this period for a cathedral in this city ; and when they had begun to carry into execution a project of erecting a magnificent church, there happened, on 11th June 1641, a violent earthquake, which did great damage in the city. This was regarded as an admonition of heaven to make the fabric more capable of resisting this sort of catastrophe, than of attracting the admiration of the curious. From this time, therefore, they no longer thought of, or rather they renounced, all ideas of magnificence, to give the building nothing but solidity. But as they have never since experienced any shock of an earthquake, they have resumed the project of building a handsome cathedral. 
17. Religious customs. — The people of Caracas, like all the Spaniards, are proud of being Christians, and are very attentive to the duties of religion, that is to the mass, days of obligation, to]  
■  

CARACAS  
["sermons and processions ; but it is worthy of remark, that they do not admit vespers in the number of religious exercises, agreeably to the custom of Old Spain and other Catholic countries. It is necessary that the men going to church should wear a cloak or great coat, or that they be dressed in a long coat ; one of these habits is indispensable, neither rank nor colour affording an exemption. 
18. Religions costumes of the women. — The dress of the women, whether rich or poor, especially of the whites, ought to be altogether black. This dress consists of a petticoat and veil both black ; the slaves alone are obliged to have a white veil. The object of this attire was, that by imposing on the sex a veil, every kind of gallantry and coquetry might be banished from the place of worship, and that by establishing uniformity in dress and colour, the pious might be reminded of the equality of all in the eyes of God. But this dress, which was intended to be the same for every woman, and of a very common stuff, has become most rare and costly, and the gauze veils which the ladies wear, expose all their features and complexion as far as the eyes. This dress, worn only in sacred duties, is now made of silk or velvet, enriched with handsome lace, which often costs from 400 to 800 dollars. Such as have no means of procuring the customary church dress, are obliged to s.o to the masses that are said before daybreak, and which are called missasde madrugada, and are performed at these hours oidy for the convenience of those who are destitute of clothes sufficiently decent to appear at church during the day. 
19. Festivals. — The Spaniards have no other festivals but those contained in the Roman calendar. They are so multiplied at Caracas that there are very few days in the year on which they do not celebrate the festival of some saint or virgin in one of the churches of the city. What greatly multiplies the number is, that each festival is preceded by nine days of devotion consecrated entirely to prayers, and followed by eight days, in which the faithful of the neighbourhood, and even of the whole city, join to prayers, public amusements, such as fireworks, music, balls, &amp;c. ; but the pleasures of these festivals never extend to the table. Public feasts, so common among all other people, are unknown on such occasions among the Spaniards. These people are sober even in the delirium of pleasure. The most striking part of their festivals is the procession of the saint they celebrate; they perform this always in the afternoon ; the saint, represented by an e&amp;igy of human 
2   church under every case she  stature, is richly dressed ; it is borne on a table handsomely decorated, and followed or preceded by some other saint of the same church, dressed less sumptuously ; a great number of banners and crosses open the cavalcade ; the men walk in two lines ; each of the principal persons holds a wax taper, then follow the music, the clergy, the civil officers, and at last the women and a file of bayonets. The followers are always very numerous. All the windows in the streets through which the procession passes, are ornamented with floating streamers, which give the whole neighbourhood an air of festivity and rejoicing. The windows of the French, in particular, are filled with ladies, who repair from all parts of the city to view the agreeable spectacle. But the principal and almost exclusive devotion of the Spaniards is to the holy Virgin; they have her in every different denominations, and in has established herself in a manner more or less miraculous. 
20. The Stage. — The sum of the public amusements at Caracas is the playhouse, at which they perform only on festivals, the price of admission being a real, nearly sixpence English, a sum sufficiently indicating the talents of the actors, and the beauty and convenience of the theatre. All the plays, bad enough in themselves, are yet more miserably performed. The performers of Caracas may be compared to strolling players who live by moving pity rather than by affording amusement; every body must suppose from this description, that an exhibition of this sort is altogether deserted, but the reader may be assured that the rich and poor, the young and the old, the nobleman and plebeian, the governor and the governed, all assiduously frequent the theatre. Independently of three tenniscourts, a few biiliardtables in a bad condition, scattered through the city, and which are but rarely frequented, complete the catalogue of amusements at Caracas. Indeed the Spaniards appear averse to all places of amusement; they live in their houses as if they were prisons, they never quit them but to go to church, or to fulfil the offices imposed on them by their stations in society. 
21. Inhabitants. — The city of Caracas contained, according to the clerical census of 1802, 31,234 souls, and in 1806 they exceeded 40,000. This population is classed into whites, slaves, freed people, and a very few Indians. The first form almost a fourth part of the amount, the slaves a third part, the Indians a twentieth part, and the freed men the remainder. In the white population there are six Castillian titles, three marquisses,]  
M   CARACAS.  
[and &lt; !i ree counts. All the whites pretend to be noble, and nearly one third of them are acknowledged to be so. The whites are all either planters, merchants, soldiers, priests, monks, financiers, or lawyers. A Spanish white person, especially a Creole, however poor he may be, thinks it the greatest disgrace to labour as a mechanic. The Europeans in Caracas form at least two very distinct classes ; the first comprises those who come from Spain with appointments : the second those actuated by industry and a spirit of enterprise, and who emigrate to acquire wealth ; the greater part of these, come from Catalonia and Biscay ; their views are purely mercantile. Both Catalonians and Biscayans are distinguished among their fellowcitizens by the good faith they observe in their business, and by their punctuality in their payments. Tlie former class, the European placemen, are most obnoxious to the Creoles, and these are in point of ability and education almost always the superiors. The Spaniards from the Canary islands, who are impelled by want, rather than fired by ambition, to quit their native soil and to establish themselves at Caracas, import with them the united industry of the Catalonians and Biscayans. Their genius assimilates more to that of the latter than to that of the former ; but, in fine, both are useful citizens, like all who strive by honest means to gain their livelihood, and who are not ashamed to prove by example, that man is born to labour. The women of Caracas are agreeable, sensible, and engaging ; few of them are fair, but they have jet black hair, with complexions as clear as alabaster ; their eyes are -larger well set, and lovely, whilst the carnation of their lips marks a health and vigour of constitution. There are a very few, however, above the middle size, whilst there are a great many under; and their feet too are rarely handsome. As they pass a great part of their lives at their windows, it may be said that they are solicitous to display that in which nature has most favoured them. There are no female schools here ; trie women therefore learn nothing but what their parents teach them, which is confined, in many cases, to praying, reading badly, and writing worse; it is difficult for any but an inspired lover to read their scrawl. They have neither dancing, drawing, nor music masters ; all they learn of these accomplishments is to play a few airs on the guitar and pianoforte ; there are but a very few who understand the rudiments of music. But in spite of this want of education, the ladies of Caracas know very well how td unite social manners with .politeness, and the art of coquetry with feminine modesty. This is, however, a picture only  of those women whose husbands or fathers possess large fortunes or lucrative places ; for that part of the female sex who are doomed to procure their own livelihood, seldom know of any other means of existence than the public prostitution of their virtue : about 200 of these poor creatures pass their days in rags and tatters in the groundfloors of houses, and stroll out only at night to procure the pittance for their next day's fare ; their dress is a white petticoat and cloak, with a pasteboard bonnet covered with lustring, to which they attach a bunch of artificial flowers and tinsel. The same dress often serves in one evening for two or three of these unhappy beings. The class of domestic slaves is considerable at Caracas, since a person believes himself rich only in proportion to the number of slaves he has in his house. In general, four times more servants are kept than are necessary, for this is thought an effectual method of Thus a white woman goes to  concealing poverty, mass with two Nearro or  
Mulatto women in her  train, without having an equal value in any other species of property. Those who are reputedly rich, are followed by four or five servants, Whilst as many attend every white person of the same family going to another church. Some houses at Caracas contain 12 or 15 servants, without counting the footmen in attendance on the men. 
22. Freed persons. — Probably there is not a city throughout all the West Indies that has so great a proportion, with respect to other classes, of enfranchised persons and their descendants, as Caracas ; they carry on all the trades which the whites disdain. Every carpenter, joiner, mason, blacksmith, locksmith, tailor, shoemaker, and goldsmith, &amp;c. is or has been an enfranchised slave; they do not excel in any of these trades, because in learning them mechanically they always err in the principle ; moreover, indolence, which is so natural to them, extinguishes that emulation to which the arts owe all their progress. However, their masonry and their carpentry are sufficiently correct, but the joiner's art is yet in its infancy. They work very little; and what appears rather contradictory is, that they work much cheaper than the European artists; in general, burdened with families, they live heaped up together in poor houses, and in the midst of privations : In this state of poverty, to employ them, you must afford an immediate advance of money. The blacksmith never has coals nor fire. The carpenter is always without wood even for a table ; even the wants of their families must be administered to by the employer. In fine, the predominant passion among this class of people is to consume]  

CARACAS.  [their lives in the exercises of dcvotion,and they are fond of forming themselves into religious societies; indeed there are few churches that have not one or two of these fraternities, composed entirely of enfranchised slaves. Every one has its uniform, differing from the other only in colour. 
23. University. — The education of the youth of Caracas and of the whole archbishopric is entirely in a college and an university united together. The foundation of the college preceded that of the university by more than 60 years. This institution originated in the piety and care of bishop A. Gonzales de Acuna, who died in 1682. At first nothing was taught here but Latin, with the addition of scholastic philosophy and theology. It has now a reading and a writing school ; three Latin schools, in one of which they profess rhetoric ; two professors of philosophy, one of which is a lay or secular priest, and the other a Dominican ; four professors of theology, two for school divinity, one for ethics, and another for positive divinity, the last of which ought always to be a Dominican ; a professor of civil law ; a professor of canon law ; a professor of medicine. The university and college of Caracas have only a capital of 47,748 dollars and 6| reals, put out at interest, and producing annually 2387 dollars, 3£ reals: this sum pays the 12 professors. All the ranks of bachelor, licentiate, and doctor, are granted at the university. The first is given by the rector, the two others by the chancellor, who is also endowed with the quality of schoolmaster. The oath of each rank is to maintain the immaculate conception, not to teach nor practise regicide or tyrannicide, and to defend the doctrine of St. Thomas. In this college and university there were, in 1802, 64 boarders, and 402 students not boarders, viz.

Their natural sobriety, and more especially their phlegmatic disposition, render quarrels and tumults very rare among them. Here there is never any noise in the streets ; every body in them is silent, dull, and grave ; 300 or 400 people coming out of a church make no more noise than a tortoise moving along the sand. But if the magistrate has nothing vor,. I.  to fear from open crimes, he has so much the more to apprehend from assassinations, thefts, frauds, and treachery. The Spaniard is far from exempt from that vindictive spirit, which is the more dangerous as it seeks its revenge only in the dark; and from that rancour which veils itself with the mask of friendship to procure an opportunity of gratifying its vengeance. A person who from his station and condition has no chance of revenging himself, save by his own hands, exhibits very little or no passion when he receives the offence ; but" from that instant he watches the opportunity, which he seldom sutlers to escape him, of plunging a poniard in the heart of his «nemy. The Spaniards from the province of Andalucia are particularly branded with this criminal habit. We are assured that these unfortunate events were unknown here before the year 1778, at which time the liberty of trading with the province of Venezuela, which was before exclusively granted to the company of Guipuscoa, was extended to all the ports of Spain, and drew a number of Spaniards to Caracas from every province, and particularly from that of Andalucia. It is true that almost all assassinations that happen at Caracas are perpetrated by the Europeans : those that can be laid to the charge of the Creoles are most rare. But all the thefts are committed by the whites or pretended whites of the country, and the enfranchised persons. False measures, false weights, changing of commodities and provisions, are likewise frequent practices ; because they are looked upon less as acts of dishonesty than as proofs of an address of which they are proud. However great may be the occupation of the police, it is certain many things call loudly upon their attention. It will hardly be believed that the city of Caracas, the capital of the province, and able to supply horned cattle to all the foreign possessions in America, is many days in the year itself in want of butcher's meat. The residence of a captaingeneral, the seat of an archbishop, of a royal audience, and of the principal tribunals of appeal, with a population of more than 40,000 souls, and, in short, with a garrison of 1000 men, experience famine in the midst of abundance. If filth does not accumulate in the streets, it is owing to the frequency of the rains, and not to the care of the police ; for they are never washed but in honour of some procession. Such streets as processions do not pass through are covered with an herb like the weed on ponds, the panicum dactylum of Linnaeus. Mendicity, which is in almost every other country the province of the police, appears t© bo unnoticed by it in Caracas. The streets are] 
R R  

MM  CARACAS.   [crowded with poor of both sexes, who have no other subsistence than what thej derive from alms, and who prefer these means of living to that of labour. It is feared that the indiscriminate charity exhibited here is productive of the worst effects ; that it affords to vice the means of remaining vicious. The police are indeed acquainted with these abuses, but cannot repress them without the imputation of impiety. To form a correct idea of the number of mendicants that wander in the streets, it is but necessary to know that the archbishop distributes generally alms every Saturday ; that each' mendicant receives a halfescalin, or l-16th of a dollar; and that at each of these pious distributions there is given a sum of from 75 or 76 dollars, which should make the number of beggars at least 1200 ; and in this list are not included those who are ashamed to beg publicly, and to whom the worthy prelate D. Francis d'Ibarra, a Creole of Caracas, distributes certain revenues in secret. The cabildo, composed of 22 members, and seconded by the alcaldes de barrio, who are magistrates distributed throughout the wards of the city, would be more than sufficient to manage the affairs of the police ; but the presence of the higher authorities, who wish to share the prerogatives of command, has made a division of all matters of police between the governor, the lieutenantgovernor, and a member of the audience, who, under the title of judge of the province, exercises its functions in conjunction with the authorities just mentioned. 
25. Communications with the interior. — Caracas, the centre of all the political, judicial, fiscal, military,' commercial, and religious concerns of its dependencies, is also naturally that of all the communication in the interior. The roads are almost every where just traced, and nothing more. The mud and overflowing of the rivers, over which there are neither bridges nor passageboats, render them impracticable in the rainy season ; and in no part of the year are they convenient. They count the distance by a day's.journey, and not by leagues : but a fair computation of a day's journey is 10 leagues, of 2000 geometrical paces each. The orders transmitted by the governor to the several towns of the interior arrive there by express, and communications of whatever nature are returned by the same means. There are no regular couriers setting out from the capital, excepting for Maracaibo, Puerto Cabello, Sante Fe, Cumana, and Guayana. All the towns situate on the roads to these four chief places enjoy the advantages of a post. The courier for Maracaibo sets out from Caracas every Thursday evening at six o'clock;  it carries the letters of Victoria, Tulmeco, Maracay, Valencia, St. Philip, Puerto Cabello, and Coro; it is 10 da} r s going from Caracas to Maracaibo, and arrives from Maracaibo at Caracas only every 15th day, but from Puerto Cabello every Tuesday. On the 6th and 22d of each month, a courier sets out from Caracas for Santa Fe ; it carries the letters of San Carlos, Guanare, Araux, Tocayo, Barquisimeto, Barinas, Merida, Cartagena, Santa Marta, and Peru ; and arrives, or ought to arrive, the 4th and 20th of each month ; it is generally 42 days in going from Caracas to Santa Fe. The courier of Cumana and Guayana arrives at Caracas once a month ; it proceeds, or stops, according to the state of the roads and rivers. Five days after its arrival at Caracas it sets out again. The letters for Guayana go directly from Barcelona by a courier ; and those for Cumana and Margareta by another. This arrives at its place of destination in 12 days, and that of Guayana in SO days. 
26. With Spain. — The official letters from Spain arrive at Caracas every month. A king's packet sails on one of the first three days of each month from Coruiia, touches at the Canaries to leave their letters, then sails for the Havana!),and leaves in its way to Puertorico the letters addressed as well for that island as for the government of Caracas. The latter are immediately forwarded by one of the little vessels kept for this service. During war the mail from Spain, instead of touching at Puertorico, leaves the letters for Caracas and its dependencies at Cumana, and those for the kingdom of Santa Fe at Cartagena, and finally always proceeds to the Havana!], from whence its departure for Spain is regular and periodical. The answers from Caracas, even those that are official, are sent to Spain by the merchant vessels which sail from Guaira to Cadiz. 
27. Geographical and statistical notices of the captainshipgeneral of Caracas, and present history.— Depons' V T oyage to the e. part of Tierra Firme, or the Spanish main, in S. America, comprises an ample description of this region; and is the principal authority for the anterior and subsequent notices. This territory is situate between the 12th degree of n. latitude and the equinoctial. It comprehends 
Venezuela, containing 500,000 inhabitants Maracaibo, j 100,000 
Cumana, 80,000 
Spanish Guayana, 54,000 
Isle of Margareta, 14,000 
728,000 ]  CARACAS.  
[Of the population two tenths are whites, three slaves, four freedmen and their descendants, and the remainder Indians. There is scarcely any emigration from Spain to Tierra Firme. The government of Caracas, like that of other parts of Spanish America, is so constituted as to keep it dependent on the parent country. The governor or captaingeneral represents the monarch, and commands the military force. There are delegated governors, who have each an assessor : the royal audience of Caracas consists of a president, who is the captaingeneral, a regent, three judges, two fiscals, one for criminal affairs, the other for the finances, with a reporter and other necessary officers. It administers justice, regulates the finances, and has other great prerogatives. The naval force of Tierra Firme is trifling, and could not resist a single frigate. Several seaports have fortresses. Maracaibo has 25,000 inhabitants, is defended by three forts and four companies of troops of the line, and a proportion of militia. The haven or port of Coro, called La Vela de Coro, sixteen leagues e. of Maracaibo, had at the time of General Miranda's expedition in 1S06, two batteries with 15 or 18 pieces of cannon of various calibres from six to 18 pounders. Puerto Cabello, 58 leagues to the e. of Coro, has a strong fort with a large and numerous artillery. In time of war it is supplied with two companies of regular troops. In case of attack, says Depons, 3000 militia might be collected here in eight days. La Guaira, the haven of Caracas, 25 leagues to the e. of Puerto Cabello, is very strongly fortified. Cumana, 100 leagues e. of La Guaira, is of difficult access, has a fort, and might collect a force of 5000 men. The island of Margareta, four leagues n. of Cumana, has trifling batteries, one company of regular troops, one of artillery, and several of militia. Thus it appears the strong places are distant from each other 60 or 100 leagues ; hence it is observed, a debarkation on the coast might easily be effected in various places, and the troops proceed into the country, whilst the ships, by attacking the forts, would distract the military operations. The military force, as stated by Depons, is a regiment of regular troops of 918 men, distributed at Caracas, La Guaira, and Puerto Cabello: 400 troops of the line are at Maracaibo, at Cumana 150, at Guiana 150, and at Barinas 77. The artillery at the respective places is served by separate companies besides militia ; the whole armed force of the captainshipgeneral, regular troops and militia, is stated at 13,059. There is no religion but the iioman Catholic. To be suspected of heresy is dangerous ; to be convicted, fatal. The tribunals of the inquisition are erected at Mexico, Lima, and Carta-   gena, and are very powerful. They prohibit bad books to the number of 5420. Spanish America abounds in priests, who are held in great respect ; the missionaries are numerous ; the churches are decent and often elegant. The tithes are paid, one tenth part to the king, one fourth to the bishop, one fourth to the chapter, and remainder to the parish priests and to other pious uses. The income of the bishop of Caracas is 40,000 dollars. The productions of this region are cacao, coffee, sugar, indigo, and tobacco. Besides the present products, there is a great variety of others which the soil offers to the inhabitants, without requiring any advance, or subjecting them to any trouble, but that of collecting and bestowing on them a light and easy preparation. Among these Depons mentions vaynilla,) wild cochineal, dyeing woods and barks, gums, rosin, and medical oils, herbs, roots and bark for medicine. From this country half Europe might be supplied with wood for its furniture and cabinetwork. Commerce might draw much from the animal kingdom. The neat cattle are calculated at 1,200,0Q0 ; horses and mares 180,000 ; and mules at 90,000 ; sheep are innumerable, and deer abundant : notwithstanding this abundance, agriculture is at a low ebb in this country. La Guaira, Puerto Cabello, Maracaibo, Cumana, Barcelona, and Margareta, havearight to trade with the mother country. In 1796 the imports from Spain to Caracas were estimated at 3, 1 18,81 l r °°^ dollars, and the exports at 283,316 dollars. There is a limited trade to the other colonies, which brings about 400,000 dollars into the country. It exports to foreign West India islands articles of its own produce, except cacao, in neutral bottoms ; part of the returns must be in Negroes or in farming or household utensils, and the remainder in specie. But this remainder is principally smuggled in manufactured goods. The contraband trade, divided chiefly between Jamaica, Curacao, and Trinidad, was estimated at 750,000 dollars annually before the war of 1796. It has increased greatly since that period. The whole regular exports of Caracas from 1793 to 1796 are stated at 12,252,415 dollars; from 1797 to 1800, 6,442,318 dollars. The finances of Caracas are under the direction of an intendant. The revenue arises principally from the customs, a duty of five per cent, on sales from stamps, licences, and tithes, and from the produce of the oruzada and of the sale of tobacco. The two last are destined for the treasury at home. There is usually a deficit, even in time of peace; in 1797 the receipt was 1,147,788 dollars ; expenditure, 1,886,363. According to Humboldt, the dollars imported into Caracas in] ft r 2   n_*  [J 803 amounted to 5,500,000, andjthe exports consisted of produce to the value of 4,000,000 dollars. He also states the population in 1808 at 900,000 souls. The receipts of Caracas, Guatemala, and Chile, are consumed within the country. The population of some of the chief cities is thus stated ; Caracas 40,000, La Guaira 6000, Puerto Cabello 7600, Coro 10,000. The harbour, or La Vela de Coro, as it is commonly called, and its environs, are supposed to contain not less than 2000. In 1797 three state prisoners were sent from Spain to Caracas, on account of their revolutionary propensities. Being treated with great indulgence by the officers and soldiers to whose care they were committed, they formed the project of a conspiracy against the government. They engaged a number of persons, some of them of consequence, in their party. After gaining their first converts, the spirit did not spread. The coldness and apathy of the people did not admit of the effervescene they desired. After the plot had been kept a secret for many months it was disclosed to the government. Some of the ringleaders escaped, and others were taken. It was found that seventytwo had entered into the conspiracy ; six were executed. The rest either escaped, or were sent to the galleys or banished from the country. For an account of the recent revolution in Caracas, see Venezuela.]

Its climate is extremely cold and subject to winds, so that it produces no other fruits than such as are found upon the sierra. It has considerable breeds of cattle both of the large and small kind, huacanos, sheep peculiar to the country, called llamas, and no small quantity of vicunas ; also in that part which borders upon the province of Pacages are some herds of swine. Its silver mines are much worked, and of these the most esteemed is that called Turco, in which is found the metal mazizo.

From this burning coal, there is emitted a gummy substance the Spaniards call cheta, which is thrown on the shore by the surf, and collected by them in considerable quantities, which they are fond of chewing ; it has the appearance and consistence of pitch, of a strong, aromatic, and not disagreeable smell. These Indians are irreconcileable enemies to the Spaniards, always at war with them, and kill them whenever they can. The Spaniards call them cannibals, but the French give them a different character, who have always been treated kindly by them since Mons. de Salle and his party were in their neighbourhood. They are saifl to be 500 men strong, but we have not been able to estimate their numbers from any very accurate information. They speak the Attakapo language ; are friendly and kind to all other Indians, and, we presume, are much like all others, notwithstanding what the Spaniards say of them.]

==[[Caren|CAREN]]==, a valley or meadowland of the kingdom of Chile, renowned for its pleasantness, beauty, and extent, being five leagues in length ; also for a fountain of very delicate and salutary water, which, penetrating to the soil in these parts, renders them so exceedingly porous, that a person treading somewhat heavily seems to shake the ground under him. There is an herb found here that keeps green all the year round: it is small, resembling trefoil, and the natives call it caren: it is of a very agreeable taste, and gives its name to the valley. 
==[[Carenero|CARENERO]]==, a bay of the coast of the kingdom of Tierra Firme in the province and government of Venezuela. It is extremely convenient for careening and repairing ships, and from this circumstance it takes its name. It lies behind cape Codera towards the e.

CARG ==[[Uairaso|UAIRASO]]==, a lofty mountain and volcano of the province and corregimiento of Riobamba in the kingdom of Quito. It is in the district of the asiento of Ambato, covered with snow the whole year round. Its skirts are covered with ■ fine crops of excellent barley. In 1698 this province was visited by a terrible earthquake, which opened the mountain and let in a river of mud, formed by the snows which were melted by the fire of the volcano, and by the ashes it threw up. So dreadful were the effects of this revolution that the whole of the crops were completely spoiled ; and it was in vain that the cattle endeavoured to    CAR  escape the destruction which followed them whereever they fled. Still are the vestiges of this calamity to be seen, and there are large quantities of this mud or lava, now become hard, scattered on the s. side of the settlement.

==[[Cariai|CARIAI]]==, a small river of the country of the Amazonas, in the part possessed by the Portuguese. It is by no means a considerable stream, runs n. and enters the Xingu. 
==[[Cariaco|CARIACO]]==, a large gulf of the coast of Tierra Firme, in the province and government of Cumana. It is also called, Of Cumana, from this capital beiiig built upon its shores. The bay runs 10 or 12 leagues from w. to e. and is one league broad at its widest part. It is from 80 to i00 fathoms deep, and the waters are so quiet as to resemble rather the waters of a lake than those of the ocean. It is surrounded by the serranias y or lofty chains of mountains, which shelter it from all winds excepting that of the n. e. which, blowing on it as it were through a straitened and narrow passage, is accustomed to cause a swell, especially from 10  in the morning until five in the evening, after which all becomes calm. Under the above circumstances, the larger vessels ply to windward ; and if the wind be very strong, they come to an anchor on the one or other coast, and wait till the evening, when the land breezes spring up from the s. e. In this gulf there are some good ports and bays, viz. the lake of Obispo, of Juanantar, of Gurintar, and others. Caiiiaco, a river of the same province and government, taking its rise from many streams and rivulets which rise in the serrania, and unite before they flow into the valley of the same name. After it has run some distance over the plain, it is cut off to water some cacao plantations, and then empties itself into the sea through the former gulf. In the winter great part of the capital, which is situate upon its banks, is inundated, and the river is then navigated by small barks or barges ; but in the summer it becomes so dry that there is scarcely water sufficient to navigate a canoe. 

CAniAco, a small city of the same province, situate on the shore of the gulf. [This city (according to Depons) bears, in the official papers and in the courts of justice, the name of San Felipe de Austria. The population is only 6500, but every one makes such a good use of his time as to banish misery from the place. The production most natural to the soil is cotton, the beauty of which is superior to that of all Tierra- Firme. This place alone furnishes annually more than 3000 quintals ; and besides cacao they grow a little sugar. Lat. 10° SO 1 n. Long. 63° 39' a.

CARIBE.  It was formerly a very rich tract of land, situate on the sbore of tbe river Cazanare, a stream •which crosses and stops the pass into the country; and for this reason there was a considerable establishment formed here by persons who belonged to the curacy of Santa Rosa de Chire. Its temperature is hot, but it is very fertile, and abounds in productions, Avhich serve to provide for the other settlements belonging to the same missions : at present it is under the care of the religious order of St. Domingo. 

==[[Caribana|CARIBANA]]==, a large country, at the present day called Guayana Maritania, or Nueva Andalucia Austral. It extends from the mouth of the river Orinoco to the mouth of the Maranon ; comprehends the Dutch colonies of Esquibo, Surinam, and Berbice, and the French colony of Cayenne. It takes its name from the Caribes Indians, who inhabit it, and who are very fierce and cruel, although upon amicable terms with the Dutch. Nearly the whole of this province is uncultivated, full of woods and mountains, but watered by many rivers, all of which run for the most part from s. to e. and empty themselves into the sea ; although some flow from s. to n. and enter the Orinoco. The climate, though warm and humid, is healthy ; the productions, and the source of its commerce, are sugarcane, some cacao, wild wax, and incense. The coast, inhabited by Europeans, forms the greater part of this tract of country, of which an account will be found under the respective articles. Caribana, a port on the coast of Tierra Firme, in the province and government of Darien, at the entrance of the gulf of Uraba. 

==[[Caribe|CARIBE]]==, a small port of the coast of Tierra Firme, in the province and government of Venezuela, to the w. of cape Codera. Caribe, Caribbee, or Chauaibes, some islands close upon the shore of the province and government of Cumana, near the cape of Tres Puntas. [The Caribbee islands in the West Indies extend in a semicircular form from the island of Porto Rico, the easternmost of the Antilles, to the coast of S. America. The sea, thus inclosed by the main land and the isles, is called the Caribbean sea ; and its great channel leads n. w. to the head of the gulf of Mexico through the sea of Honduras. The chief of these islands are, Santa Cruz, Sombuca, Anguilla, St. Martin, St. Bartholomew, Barbuda, Saba, St. Eustatia, St. Christopher, Nevis, Antigua, Montserrat, Guadalupe, Deseada, Mariagalante, Dominica, Martinica, St. Vincent, Barbadoes, and Grenada. These are again classed into Windward and Leeward isles by 

VOL. i.  seamen, with regard to the usual courses of ships from Old Spain or the Canaries to Cartagena or New Spain and Porto Bello. The geographical tables and maps class them into Great and Little Antilles ; and authors vary much concerning this last distinction. See Antilles. The Charaibes or Caribbees were the ancient natives of the Windward islands ; hence many geographers confine the term to these isles only. Most of these were anciently possessed by a nation of cannibals, the terror of the mild and inoffensive inhabitants of Hisparaola, who frequently expressed to Columbus their dread of these fierce invaders. Thus, when these islands were afterwards discovered by that great man, they were denominated Charibbean isles. Tbe insular Charaibs are supposed to be immediately descended from the Galibis Indians, or Charaibes of S. America. An ingenious and learned attempt to trace back the origin of the Caribes to some emigrants from the ancient hemisphere may be found in Bryan Edwards ; and it is to the valuable work of this author that we are indebted for the following illustrations of the manners and customs of this people. — The Caribes are avowedly of a fierce spirit and warlike disposition. Historians have not failed to notice these among the most distinguishable of their qualities. Dr. Robertson, in Note XCIII. to the first vol. of his History of America, quotes from a MS. History of Ferdinand and Isabella, written by Andrew Bernaldes, the cotemporary and friend of Columbus, the following instance of the bravery of the Caribes : A canoe with four men, two women, and a boy, unexpectedly fell in with Columbus's fleet. A Spanish bark with 25 men was sent to take them; and the fleet, in the mean time, cut off their communication with the shore. Instead of giving way to despair, the Caribes seized their arms with undaunted resolution, and began the attack, wounding several of the Spaniards, although they had targets as well as other defensive armour; and even after the canoe was overset, it was with no little difficulty and danger that some of them were secured, as they continued to defend themselves, and to use their bows with great dexterity while swimming in the sea. Herrera has recorded the same anecdote. Restless, enterprising, and ardent, it would seem they considered war as the chief end of their creation, and the rest of the human race as their natural prey ; for they devoured, without remorse,,the bodies of such of their enemies (the men at least) as fell into their hands. Indeed, there is no circumstance in the history of mankind better attested than the universal prevalence of these practices among them, Columbus was not] s s   -

[only informed of it by the natives of Hispaniola, nut having landed himself at Guadalupe on its first discovery, he beheld in several cottages the head and limbs of the human body recently separated, and evidently kept for occasional repasts. He released at the same time several of the natives of Porto Rico, who, having been brought captives from thence, were reserved as victims for the same horrid purpose. But among themselves they were peaceable, and towards each other faithful, friendly, and affectionate. They considered all strangers indeed as enemies, and of the people of Europe they formed a right estimation. The antipathy which they manifested towards the unoffending natives of the larger islands appears extraordinary, but it is said to have descended to them from their ancestors of Guiana : they considered those islanders as a colony of Arrowauks, a nation of South America, with whom the Caribes of that continent are continually at war. We can assign no cause for such hereditary and irreconcilable hostility. With regard to the people of Europe, it is allowed, that whenever any of them had acquired their confidence, it was given without reserve. Their friendship was as warm as their enmity was implacable. The Caribes of Guiana still fondly cherish the tradition of Raleigh's alliance, and to this day preserve the English colours which he left with them at parting. (Bancroft, p. 259.) They painted their faces and bodies with arnotto so extravagantly, that their natural complexion, which was nearly that of a Spanish olive, was not easily to be distinguished under the surface of crimson. However, as this mode of painting themselves was practised by both sexes, perhaps it was at first introduced as a defence against the venomous insects so common in tropical climates, or possibly they considered the brilliancy of the colour as highly ornamental. The men disfigured their cheeks with deep incisions and hideous scars, which they stained with black, and they painted white and black circles round their eyes ; some of them perforated the cartilage that divides the nostrils, and inserted the bone of some fish, a parrot's feather, or a fragment of tortoiseshell ; a frightful custom, practised also by the natives of New Holland ; and they strung together the teeth of such of their enemies as they had slain in battle, and wore them on their legs and arms as trophies of successful cruelty. To draw the bow with unerring skill, to wield the club with dexterity and strength, to swim with ability and boldness, to catch fish, and to build a cottage were acquirements of indispensable necessity and the education of their children was well  suited to the attainment of them. One method of making their boys skilful, even in infancy, in the exercise of the bow, was to suspend their food on the branch of a tree, compelling the hardy urchins to pierce it with their arrows before they could obtain permission to eat. Their arrows were commonly poisoned, except when they made their military excursions by night: on those occasions they converted them into instruments of still greater mischief; for, by arming the points with pledgets of cotton dipt into oil, and set on flame, they fired whole villages of their enemies at a distance. The poison which they used was a concoction of noxious gums and vegetable juices, and had the property of being perfectly innocent when received into the stomach; but if communicated immediately to the blood through the slightest wound, it was generally mortal. As soon as a male child was brought into the world, he was sprinkled with some drops of his father's blood. The ceremonies used on this occasion were sufficiently painful to the father, but he submitted without emotion or complaint, fondly believing that the same degree of courage which he had himself displayed was by these means transmitted to his son. As the boy grew, he was soon made familiar with scenesof barbarity ; he partook of the horrid repasts of his nation, and he was frequently anointed with the fat of a slaughtered Arrowauk : but he was not allowed to participate in the toils of the warrior, and to share the glories of conquest, until his fortitude had been brought to the test. The dawn of manhood ushered in the hour of severe trial. He was now to exchange the name he had received in his infancy for one more sounding and significant; a ceremony of high importance in the life of a Caribe, but always accompanied by a scene of ferocious festivity and unnatural cruelty. In times of peace, the Caribes admitted of no supremacy but that of nature. Having no laws, they needed no magistrates. To their old men, indeed, they allowed some kind of authority, but it was at best illdefined, and must at all times have been insufficient to protect the weak against the strong. In war, experience had taught them that subordination was as requisite as courage ; they thereiore elected their captains in their general assemblies with great solemnity, but they put their pretensions to the proof with circumstances of outrageous barbarity. When success attended the measures of a candidate for command, the feast and the triumph awaited his return. He exchanged his name a second time ; assuming in future that of the most formidable Arrowauk that had fallen by his hand. He was permitted to appropriate to himself as many]  m  i, &amp;   I B E.  f of the captives as he thought fit, and his countrymen presented to his choice the most beautiful of their daughters in reward of his valour. It was probably this lastmentioned testimony of public esteem and gratitude that gave rise in these islands to the institution of polygamy, which, as hath been already observed, prevailed universally among them, and still prevails among the Caribes of S. America; an institution the more excusable, as their women, from religious motives, carefully avoided the nuptial intercourse after pregnancy. Though frequently bestowed as the prize of successful courage, the wife, thus honourably obtained, was soon considered of as little value as the captive. Deficient in those qualities which alone were estimable among the Caribes, the females were treated rather as slaves than companions : ihey sustained every species of drudgery ~ they ground the maize, prepared the cassavi, gathered in the cotton, and wove the hammoc; nor were they allowed even the privilege of eating in presence of their husbands. Under these circumstances, it is not wonderful that they were less prolific than the women of Europe. Father Joseph Gumilla, in his account of the nations bordering on the Orinoco, relates (torn. i. p. 207. Fr. translation), that the Caribes of the continent punish their women caught in adultery like the ancient Israelites, " by stoning them to death before an assembly of the people ;" a fact not recorded by any other writer. We know but little concerning their domestic economy, their arts, manufactures, and agriculture ; their sense of filial and paternal obligations, their religious rights and funeral ceremonies. Such further information, however, in these and other respects, as authorities the least disputable afford, we have abridged in the following detached observations. Besides the ornaments which we have noticed to have been worn by both sexes, the women, on arriving at the age of puberty, were distinguished also by a sort of buskin or half boot made of cotton, which surrounded the small part of the leg. The same sort of brodequin or buskin is worn by the female Hottentots and other nations of Africa; a distinction, however, to which such of their females as had been taken in the chance of war dared not aspire. In other respects, both male and female appeared as naked as our first parents before the fall. Like them, as ihey knew no guilt, they knew no shame ; nor was clothing thought necessary to personal comfort, where the chill blast of winter is never felt. Their, hair was uniformly of a shining black, straight, and coarse ; but they dressed it with daily care, and adorned it with great art, the men, in particular,  decorating their heads with feathers of various colours. As their hair thus constituted their chief pride, it was an unequivocal proof of the sincerity of their sorrow, when, on the death of a relation or friend, they cut it short like their slaves and captives, to whom the privilege of wearing long hair was rigorously denied. Like most other nations of the new hemisphere, they eradicated, with great nicety, the incipient beard, and all superfluous hairs on their bodies ; a circumstance which has given rise to the false notion that all the Aborigines of America were naturally beardless. On the birth of a child, its tender and flexible skull was confined between two small pieces of wood, which, applied before and behind, and firmly bound together on each side, elevated the forehead, and occasioned it and the back part of the skull to resemble two sides of a square ; a custom still observed by the miserable remnant of [led Caribes in the island of St. Vincent. It has been said by anatomists, that the coronal suture of new born children in the West Indies is commonly more open than that of infants born in colder climates, and the brain more liable to external injury. Perhaps, therefore, the Indian custom of depressing the os frontis and the occiput, was originally meant to assist the operation of nature in closing the skull. They resided in villages which resembled an European encampment, for their cabins were built of poles fixed circularly in the ground, and drawn to a point at the top ; they were then covered with leaves of the palm tree. In the centre of each village was a building of superior magnitude to the rest: it was formed with great labour, and served as a public hall or state house, wherein we are assured that the men (excluding the women) had their meals in common. These halls were also the theatres where their youth were animated to emulation, and trained to martial enterprise by the renown of their warriors and the harangues of their orators. Their arts and manufactures, though few, displayed a degreeof ingenuity which one would have scarcely expected to find amongst a people so little removed from a state of mere animal nature as to reject all dress as superfluous. Columbus observed an abundance of substantial cotton cloth in all the islands which he visited ; and the natives possessed the art of staining it with various colours, though the Caribes delighted chiefly in red. Of this cloth they made hammocs, or hanging beds, such as are now used at sea ; for Europe has not only copied the pattern, but preserved also the original name. All the early Spanish and French writers expressly assert, that the original Indian name for their swing-] s s 2   if  CAR I BE. -  
[ing beds was amaclc or hamack, but Dr. Johnson derives the English word hammoc from the Saxon. They possessed likewise the art of making vessels of clay for domestic uses, which they baked in kilns like the potters of Europe. The ruins of many of these kilns were visible not long since in Barbadoes, where specimens of the manufacture are still frequently dug up; and Mr. Hughes, the historian of that island, observes, that they far surpassed the earthen ware made by the Negroes, in thinness, smoothness, and beauty. (Nat. Hist, of Barbadoes, p. 8.) Ligon, who visited this island in 1647, declares, that some of these vessels which he saw even surpassed any earthen ware made in England, " both," to use his own words, " in finesse of mettle and curiosity of turninge." Besides those, they invented various other utensils for economical purposes, which are enumerated by Labat. The baskets which they composed of the fibres of the palmetoleaves were singularly elegant ; and we are told that their bows and arrows, and other weapons, displayed a neatness and polish which the most skilful European artist would have found it difficult to have excelled, even with European tools. We are told, on good authority, that among the Caribes of the continent there was no division of land ; the harvests were deposited in public granaries, whence each family received its proportion of the public stock. Rochford indeed observes, that all their interests were in common. Their food, both vegetable and animal, excepting in the circumstance of their eating human flesh, seems to have been the same, in most respects, as that of the natives of the larger islands. But although their appetites were voracious, they rejected many of the best bounties of nature. Of some animals they held the flesh in abhorrence : these were the pecary or Mexican hog, the manati or sea cow, and the turtle. Labat observes, that they scrupled likewise to eat the eel, which the rivers in several of the islands supply in great plenty. The striking conformity of these, and some other of their prejudices and customs, to the practices of the Jews, has not escaped the notice of historians. On the birth of his first son, the father retired to his bed, and fasted with a strictness that often endangered life. Lafitau, observing that the same custom was practised by the Tybarenians of Asia, and the Iberians or ancient inhabitants of Spain, and is still in use among the people of Japan, not only urges this circumstance as a proof, among others, that the new world was peopled from the old, but pretends to discover in it also some traces of the doctrine of original sin : he supposes that the severe penance  thus voluntarily submitted to by the father was at first instituted in the pious view of protecting his issue from the contagion of hereditary guilt, averting the wrath of offended Omnipotence at the crime of our first parents, and expiating their guilt by his sufferings. The ancient Thracians, as we are informed by Herodotus, when a male child Avas brought into the world, lamented over him in sad vaticination of his destiny, and they rejoiced when he was released by death from those miseries which they considered as his inevitable portion in life ; but whatever might have been the motives that first induced the Caribes to do penance on such occasions, it would seem that grief and dejection had no great share in them ; for the ceremony of fasting was immediately succeeded by rejoicing and triumph, by drunkenness and debauchery. Their lamentations for the dead seem to have arisen from the more laudable dictates of genuine nature ; for, unlike the Thracians on these solemnities, they not only despoiled their hair, as we have before related, but when the master of the family died, the surviving relations, after burying the corpse in the centre of his own dwelling, with many demonstrations of unaffected grief, quitted the house altogether, and erected another in a distant situation. The dead body they placed in the grave in a sitting posture, with the knees to the chin. It is asserted, and we believe with truth, that the expectation of a future state has prevailed amongst all mankind in all ages and countries of the world. It is certain that the idea of a future state prevailed among the Caribes ; they not only believed that death was not the final extinction of their being, but pleased themselves also with the fond conceit, that their departed relations were secret spectators of their conduct ; that they still sympathized in their sufferings, and participated in their welfare. To these notions they added others of a dreadful tendency ; for, considering the soul as susceptible of the same impressions, and possessing the same passions as when allied to the body, it was thought a religious duty to their deceased heroes, to sacrifice at their funerals some of the captives which had been taken in battle. It was their custom to erect in every cottage a rustic altar, composed of banana leaves and rushes, whereon they occasionally placed the earliest of their fruits and the choicest of their viands, as humble peaceofferings, through the mediation of their inferior deities, to incensed Omnipotence : for it is adaiitted, that their devoiions consisted less in the effusions of thankfulness, than in deprecations of wrath. They not only believed in the existence of demons and evil spirits, but offered to them also, by the hands of their] CAR 
[boj/es or pretended magicians, sacrifices and worship ; wounding themselves on such solemnities with an instrument made of the teeth of the agouti, which inflicted horrible gashes ; conceiving, perhaps, that the malignant powers delighted in groans and misery, and were to be appeased only by human blood.]

CAR1BES, a barbarous and ferocious nation of Indians, who are cannibals, inhabiting the province which by them is called Caribana. They are divided under the titles of the Maritimos and Medilerraneos : the former live in plains and upon the coast of the Atlantic, are contiguous to the Dutch and French colonies, and follow the laws and customs of the former, with whom they carry on a commerce. They are the most cruel of any that infest the settlements of the missions of the river Orinoco, and are the same as those called Galibis. The Mediterraneos, who inhabit the s. side of the source of the river Caroni, are of a more pacific nature, and began to be reduced to the faith by the regular order of the abolished society of the Jesuits in 1738. The name of Caribes is given not only to these and other Indians of the Antilles, but to all such as are cannibals. See Cakibe.

Dickinson college, named after the celebrated John Dickinson, esq. author of several valuable tracts, has a principal, three professors, a philosophical apparatus, and a library containing near 3000 volumes. Its revenue arises from 4000/. in funded certificates, and 10,000 acresof land. In 1787 there were 80 students, and its reputation is daily increasing. About 50 years ago this spot was inhabited by Indians and wild beasts.]

Carlos, San, a city of the province and government of Venezuela ; situate on the shore of the river Aguirre, to the n. of the city of Nirua. [It owes its existence to the first missionaries of Venezuela, and its increase and beauty to the activity of its inhabitants. The greatest part of its population is composed of Spaniards from the Canary islands ; and us these leave their native country  but to meliorate their condition, they arrive with a willingness to work, and a courage to undertake any thing that they think the most proper to answer their views. Their example even inspires a sort of emulation among the Creoles, productive of public prosperity. Cattle forms the great mass of the wealth of the inhabitants. Oxen, horses, and mules, are very numerous. Agriculture, although not much followed, is yet not neglected. Indigo and coffee are almost the only things they grow. The quality of the soil gives' the fruits an exquisite flavour, but particularly the oranges, which are famed throughout the province. The city is large, handsome, and well divided : they compute the inhabitants at 9500. The parish church, by its construction and neatness, answers to the industry and piety of the people. The heat at San Carlos is extreme ; it would be excessive if the n. wind did net moderate the effects of the sun. It lies in 9° 20 7 lat. 60 leagues s. w. of Caracas, 24 *. s.e. of St. Valencia, and 20 from St. Philip's.

The village is two leagues distant from the presidio of the same name. It appears that the bay of Monterey had already been discovered by Cabrillo on the 15th November 1542, and that he gave it the name of Bahia de los Pinos, on account of the beautiful pines with which the neighbouring mountains are covered. It received its present name about 60 years afterwards from Viscaino, in honour of the viceroy of Mexico, Gaspar de Zunega, Count de Monterey, an active man, to whom we are indebted for considerable maritime expeditions, and who engaged Juan de Onate in the conquest of New Mexico.

[==[[Carnesville|CARNESVILLE]]==, the chief town of Franklin county, Georgia, 100 miles n. w. of Augusta. It contains a courthouse, and about 20 dwellinghouses.] 
==[[Carolina|CAROLINA]]==, a province of N. America, and part of that extensive country anciently called Florida, bounded n. by Virginia, s. by the true Florida, w. by Louisiana, and e. by the Atlantic. It is, divided into N. and S. Carolina. Its extent is 135 leagues in length, nearly from s. w. to n. e. and 75 in width from e. to w. from 30° to 36° 30' of lat. It was discovered by Juan Ponce de Leon in 1512, though it was not settled by the Spaniards then, but abandoned until the reign of Charles IX. king of France, when the Frenoh established themselves in it, under the command of admiral Chatilon, protector of the Protestants. He founded a colony and a fort called Charles fort, and gave the name of Carolina to the country, in honour to his monarch. This establishment, however, lasted but a short time, for it was destroyed by the Spaniards, who put to the sword the new colonists, and went away under the impression that they had now left the country in a perfectly abandoned state. But the English, at this time, were maintaining a footing here, under the command of Sir Walter Raleigh, though they were not under any formal establishment until the reign of Charles II. in 1663, when the country was granted as a property to the following nobility, viz. the Count of Clarendon, Duke of Albemarle, Count of Craven, John Berkley, John Ashley, afterwards Count of Shaftsbury, George Carteret, John Colleton, and William Berkley; by these it was divided into as many counties, and by them names were given to the rivers, settlements, &amp;c. Their privilege of proprietorship and   jurisdiction extended from lat. 31° to 36° n. and they had an absolute authority to form establishments and governments, according to the laws and statutes laid down by that famous and renowned philosopher John Locke ; accordingly the government partook largely of the despotic, and the rulers had the power of acknowledging or renouncing laws, of conferring titles, employments, promotions, and dignities, according to their own caprice. They divided the population into three classes: The first was composed of those entitled the Barons; and to these were given 120,000 acres of land ; the second were two lordships, with the title of Counts, to whom were given 240,000 acres ; and the third, who were called Landgraves, a title corresponding to Dukes, had a portion of 480,000 acres. This last body formed the high councilchamber, and the lower was composed of the representatives of the counties and cities, both of these together forming the parliament, this being the real title, and not assembly, as in the other colonies. The first establishment was the city of Charlestown, between two navigable rivers called Ashley and Cowper ; the same offered an asylum to the Europeans, who on account of religious disturbances fled from Europe, and who having suffered great distresses there, had afterwards to encounter a very unfriendly reception from the Indians. Such was the state of affairs until 1728, when this city was taken under the protection of the English crown ; a corresponding recompence having been paid to the lords, the proprietors, who yielding it up, thus made a virtue of necessity ; the Count Grenville, however, persisted in keeping his eighth share. From that time it was divided into two parts, called North and South . The climate differs but little from that of Virginia, although the heat in the summer is rather more powerful here ; the winter, however, is shorter and milder ; the temperature is serene and the air healthy ; tempests and thunder storms are frequent, and this is the only part of this continent wherein have been experienced hurricanes; although they are but rare here, and never so violent as in the islands. The half of March, the whole of April, May, and the greater part of June, the season is mild and agreable ; in July, August, and nearly all September, the heat is intense ; but the winter is so mild, especially when the n.w. wind prevails, that the water is seldom frozen. It is extremely fertile, and abounds in wheat, barley, rice, and all kinds of pulse, flowers, and fruits of an exquisite flavour; and the soil, which is uncultivated, is covered with all kinds of trees. The principal  CAR emolument which used to be derived to the English from the skins of the castor, is at present greatly abridged from the circumstance of the Indians invariably destroying this animal ; but the loss is in a great measure made up from the great gain acquired in the sale of turpentine, fish, and pitch. Here they cultivate quantities of indigo of three sorts, much maize, and in the lowlands excellent rice. All this province is a plain 80 miles in length, carrying on a great commerce in the above productions, and formerly that of rice was very considerable ; it being computed to have yielded that article to the value of 150,000^. sterling per annum. In its woods are many exquisite kinds of timber, and the country abounds with rabbits, hares, dantas, deer, pheasants, partridges, cranes, pigeons, and other birds, and with numbers of ravenous and fierce wolves, against the attacks of which it is difficult to preserve the cattle. The European animals have also multiplied here astonishingly, so that it is not unusual for persons, who at first had not more than three or four cows, now to possess as many thousands. These two provinces forming Carolina have 10 navigable rivers, with an infinite number of smaller note, all abounding in fish ; but they hare few good ports, and the best of these is Cape Fear. N. Carolina is not so rich as is S. Carolina, and Denton was formerly the capital of the former, but it is at present reduced to a miserable village ; the capital of both is Charlestown, which since the last war is independent of the English, together with all the country, which now forms one of the 13 provinces composing the United States of America.

Caroni, a large and abundant river of the province of Guayana. It rises in the mountains inhabited by the Mediterranean Caribes Indians, runs many leagues, laving, the territory of the Capuchin missionaries of Guayana. Its shores are very delightful, from the variety of trees and birds found upon them. It enters the Orinoco on the*, side, eight leagues from the garrison of Guayana, and 72 leagues before this river enters the sea, being divided into two arms, which form a small island. It is very abundant and wide, but it is not navigable, on account of the rapidity of its current, and from its being filled with little islands and shoals, as likewise on account of a great waterfall or cataract, which causes a prodigious noise, and is close to the mission and settlement of Aguacagua. Its waters are very clear, although at first sight they appear dark and muddy, which effect is produced from the bed of the river being of a sand of this colour. Its source, though not accurate! j known, is affirmed by the Caribes Indians to be in the snowy sierra to the n. of the lake of Parime, that also being the source by which this lake is supplied. At its entrance into the Orinoco, it gushes with such impetuosity as to repel the waters of this river the distance of a gun's shot, [or, as Depons observes, half a league. Its course is directly from s. to n. and its source is more than 100 leagues from its mouth.] 

==[[Caropi|CAROPI]]==, a river of the island and government of Trinidad. It runs from e. to w. and enters the sea in the gulf Triste. 
==[[Carora|CARORA]]==, S. Juan Bautista del Portillo de, a city of the province and government of Venezuela, founded by Captain John Salamanca in 1572, and not in 1566, as is asserted by Father Coleti, in the Siege of Baraquiga. It is situate in the savanas or llanuras ; is of a hot temperature, but very healthy, although deficient' in water, since the river Morere, w r hich passes in its vicinity, affords but a trifling stream in the summer, and is at times entirely dry. In its district are bred all kinds of cattle, but particularly thegoat, asthequantities of thorns and thistles found in this country render it peculiarly adapted for the nourishment of this animal. It abounds in very fine grains, also in aromatic balsams and gums, noted for the cure of wounds. At present it is reduced to a miserable population, unworthy of the name of a city, consisting of Mustees, Mulattoes, and some Indians ; but it still preserves a very good parish church, a convent of monks of St. Francisco, and t T  — T^'  w   I  C A R  an hermitage dedicated to St. Denis the Areopagite. It lies to the s. of the city of Barquisimeto, between that of T'ucuyo and the lake of Maracaibo. [Carora is 30 leagues to the s. of Coro. Its situation owes nothing to nature but a salabrious air. Its soil, dry and covered with thorny plants, gives no other productions but such as owe almost entirely their existence to the principle of heat. They remark there a sort of cochineal sihestre as fine as the misteca, which they suffer to perish. The land is covered with prolific animals, such as oxen, mules, horses, sheep, goats, &amp;c; and the activity evinced by the inhabitants to make these advantageous to them, supports the opinion that there are but few cities in the Spanish West Indies where there is so much industry as at Carora. The principal inhabitants live by the produce of their flocks, whilst the rest gain their livelihood by tanning and selling the hides and skins. Although their tanning be bad, the consumer cannot reproach the manufacturer, for it is impossible to conceive how they can sell the article, whatever may be its quality, at the moderate price it fetches. The skins and leather prepared at Carora are used in a great degree by the inhabitants themselves for boots, shoes, saddles, bridles, and strops. The surplus of the consumption of the place is used throughout the province, or is sent to Maracaibo, Cartagena, and Cuba. They also manufacture at Carora, from a sort of aloe disthica, very excellent hammocs, which form another article of their trade. These employments occupy and support a population of 6200 souls, who, with a sterile soil, have been able to acquire that ease and competency which it appears to have been the intention of nature to deny them. The city is well built ; the streets are wide, running in straight parallel lines. The police and the administration of justice are in the hands of a lieutenant of the governor and a cabildo. There is no military authority. Carora lies in lat. 9° 50' n. and is 15 leagues e. of the lake of Maracaibo, 12 n. of Tocuyo, 18 n. w. of Barquisimeto, and 90 w. of Caracas.] 
Carora, a great llanura of the same province, which extends 16 leagues from e. to w. and six from n. to 5.

Its population is notlarger than that of the former city, to which it gives its name.

==[[Cartagena|CARTAGENA]]==, a province and government of the kingdom of Tierra Firme, in the jurisdiction of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, bounded n. by ^ the sea, s. by the province of Antioquia, e. by the province and government of Santa Marta, from which it is divided by the Rio Grande de la Magdalerta, and w. by the province of Darien, being separated by the river San Juan ; it is 100 leagues long, running nearly from n. e. to s. w. and 80 wide, e. w. It was discovered by Rodrigo Bastidas in 1520, and subdued by the adelantado or governor Pedro de Heredia, at the expence of many battles, owing to the valour and warlike disposition of the natives. This country is of a very hot and moist temperature, full of mountains and woods, and towards the n. part swampy, sandy, and full of pools of seawater, from the lowness of the territory ; but it is at the same time fertile, and abounds in maize, pulse, and fruits, as also in cattle, of the hides and fat of which this province makes a great traffic. Its mountains produce excellent woods, and the famous dyeing wood, equal to that of Campecbe, with an abundance of excellent gums, medicinal balsams, and herbs. Here are many kinds of rare birds, animals, and snakes of different species ; amongst the former the most temarkable are the perico, of the figure of a cat, and so heavy that it takes a full hour to move itself 20 paces ; the mapurito, of the size of a small lapdog, whose arms and means of defending himself from other animals and his pursuers consist simply in discharging some wind with such force and noise as to stupify his enemies, whilst he quietly makes his retreat to some neighbouring thicket. This province produces also indigo, tortoiseshell, and cotton, and some cacao of an excellent quality in the Rio de la Magdalena. It was well peopled with Indians in the time of its gentilism, but its inhabitants are now reduced to a very trifling number. It is watered by various rivers, but those of the most consideration are El Grande de la Magdalena, and that of San Juan, or Atracto, both of which are navigable and well stocked with alligators, tortoises, and a multitude of fishes. Its district contains 83 settlements, of   which there are two cities, seven towns, and 96 settlements or villages, inhabited by 59,233 whites, 13,993 Indians, and 7770 Negro and Mulatto slaves, according to the numeration of the fiscal of the royal audience of Santa Fe, Don Francisco Moreno y Escandon, in the year 1770.

The capital is a large city adorned with beautiful buildings, founded by Pedro de Heredia in 1533, on the shore of a great and very convenient bay more than two leagues in length. It was called Calamari in the time of the Indians, which signifies, in their language, the land of crawfish, from the abundance of these found in it. It is situate on a sandy island, which forming a narrow strait, gives a communication to the part called Tierra Bomba; on the left it is entered by a wooden bridge, having a suburb called Xiximani, which is another island uniting with the continent by means of a bridge in the same manner as itself. It is well fortified, and is the residence of a governor, with the title of captaingeneral, dependent on the viceroy of Santa Fe, having been independent till the year 1739. Besides the precinct and bastions, it. has a halfmoon, which defends the entrance or gate; and at a small distance is the castle of San Felipe de Baraxas, situate on an eminence, and on the side of the bay the castles of San Luis, Santa Cruz, San Joseph, San Felipe, and Pastelillo, which Avere rebuilt in a modern manner, in 1654, by the Lieutenantgeneral Don Ignacio de Sala, with the names of San Fernando, San Joseph, El Angel, and El Pastelillo. The cathedral church is magnificent, and included in it is the parish of Sagrario, besides two other parishes called La Trinidad and Santo Toribo. It has the convents of monks of St. Francisco, St. Domingo, St. Augustin, St. Diego, La Merced, and San Juan de Dios, which is an hospital, and situate at the top of a high mountain without the walls of the city,at a quarter of a league's distance from the convent of the barefooted Augustins, called Nuestra Senora de la Popa ; to this convent vessels are accustomed to offer up a salutation as soon as they discover it at sea. It has also a college which belonged to the' society of Jesuits, a convent of Santa Clara, one of the Observers of San Francisco, and another of barefooted Car-  melites. At a small distance without the city is the hospital of San Lazaro for lepers, which malady is epidemical in the country. It has also a tribunal of the inquisition, established in 1610, of which there is only three in all America, and putting tli is city, in this point of view, on a footing with the metropolitan cities Lima and Mexico. It is the head of a bishopric erected in 1534 by his holiness Clement VII. The bay abounds in fish of various kinds, but it is infested by marine wolves. The climate of this city is very hot : from May to November, which are the winter months, thunder,, rain, and tempests are very frequent, but from this inconvenience they deriye an advantage of filling with water their cisterns, called aljibes, and which afford them the only supply of this most necessary article; accordingly every house is furnished with one of these cisterns : from December to April, which is the summer, the heat is excessive, occasioning continual perspiration, which debilitates the frame, and causes the inhabitants to have a pale and unhealthy appearance, although they nevertheless enjoy good health, it being not unusual to find amongst them persons exceeding 80 years of age. The irregularity of this climate produces several very afflicting disorders, as the black vomit, wJiich is most common amongst strangers and seafaring people, few of whom have the luck to escape it, but no person ever has it twice. The inhabitants are likewise much troubled with the leprosy, or disease of St. Lazarus ; the culebrilla, which is an insect which breeds under the skin, and causes a swelling which is accustomed to terminate in gangrene and spasms or convulsions : besides these inconveniences, there are multitudes of troublesome insects which infest the houses, such as beetles, tiiguas, scorpions, centipeds, and morcielagos. The largest trees are the caob, the cedar, the maria, and balsam ; of the first are made canoes, out of the solid trunk, for fishing and commerce ; the red cedar is better than the white, and the two last, not to mention their utility from the compactness of their timber, for their delicious smell and beautiful colour, are the trees from whence are procured those admirable distillations called the oil of Maria and balsam of Tolu. Here are also tamarind trees, medlars, sapolas, papayas, cassias, and Indian apple trees, producing delicate and pleasant fruits ; the fruit, however, of the last mentioned is poisonous, and many who, deceived by the beauty of these apples, have the rashness to taste them, soon repent of their folly, for they immediately swell to a distressing degree : so if perchance any one should sleep under its branches, he will be afflicted in the same way.  

CARTAGENA.  
The antidote, however, is oil taken in abundance internally, and applied outwardly. Neither wheat nor barley are known here, but the place abounds in maize and rice, of which they make cakes, and which are the common bread of the natives, and more particularly so that called cazave, being a sort of cake made of the root yuca, name, or moniato. There are also a great number of cotton trees. The arms of this city are a green cross upon a gold ground, with a lion rampant on each side. It was sacked in 1593 by Robert Baalj a pirate ; in 1583, by Sir Francis Drake, 23 years from the time of its being fortified, and not from its foundation, as according to Mr. La Matiniere ; again in 1695, by Mr. Ducase, assisted by the adventurers or flibustiers, who completely pillaged it : but a great sensation having been caused amongst the inhabitants at the loss of a superb sepulchre made of silver, in which it was usual on a good Friday to deposit the eucharist, they had the good fortune to obtain its restitution through the interest and favour of Louis XIV. The English, under the command of Admiral Vernon and Sir Charles Ogle, besieged this city in 1740, when, although its castles were destroyed it was completely besieged, it would not surrender, being gloriously defended by the viceroy Don Sebastian de Eslava, and Don Bias de Lezo who caused the English to abandon the enterprise with precipitancy and with great loss. [For this conduct on the part of the English, several reasons were assigned besides the strength of the place ; namely, the mortality among the troops, want of skill in the commanders, and certain differences between the admiral and the general. The fortifications which they demolished have since been repaired.] It is the only part of all America where there is effective coin of a fourth part of a real in silver. Its inhabitants amount to 9160 souls in communion. It has been the native place of many celebrated persons, such are, 
Don Augustin Samiento de Sotomayor, of the order of Santiago, viscount of Portillo. 
Don Andres de la Vega, professor at Salamanca, a famous lawyer. 
Fray Carlos de Melgarcjo, a religious Dominican, an excellent preacher, and a man of unblemished life.

==[[Cartago|CARTAGO]]==, a city of the province and government of Popayan, founded by the Brigadier George Robledo in 1540, who gave it this name, with the dedicatory title of San Juan, his patron ; the greater part of the military in it having come from the city of Cartagena in Europe. It did lie between the rivers Otun and Quindio; but the  continual invasions it has experienced from the Pijaos and Pimaes Indians, who are a bold and warlike people, determined its inhabitants to remove it at the end of the 17th century to the spot where it now stands ; having bought for that purpose some land of Tomasa Izquierdo, on the bank of an arm of the river of La Vieja, which is a  large stream,  and navigable for canoes and rafts,  and which is at the distance of rather better than a quarter of a mile from the large river Cauca, into which the above river enters, forming before the city an island, which abounds in animals of the chase, and in cattle, and having on its banks excellent fishing. This city is of a dry and healthy climate ; and although hot, the atmosphere is always clear and serene. It is situate upon a level and somewhat elevated plain, of beautiful appearance ; the streets are spacious, wide and straight. It has a very large grand square. Its buildings are solid and of good structure, and universally roofed over with straw, having, however, the walls of solid stone from the top to the bottom ; others are built of brick, and others with rafters of wood,, the walls being of clay, (which they call imbutidos r or inlaid), so solid as to resist the force of the most violent earthquakes, as was experienced in one that happened in 1785. At a small distance from the city are various lakes or pools of water, which they call cienegas, formed by nature, assisted by art.

Of no less estimation is the tobacco, with which a great traffic was formerly carried on at Choco. The district of this city abounds in trees, medicinal herbs and fruits, and ia an exquisite variety of cocao plants; also  in beautiful singing birds ; and in its fivers are many sorts offish of a fine flavour, particularly the palah. It is not without mines of gold, and labaderos or washing places, but these are not worked, save by a few daylabourers. In the church of the monks of San Francisco is venerated an image of the (most Holy Mary, with the title of La Proheza, painted on a piece of cottonstuff, adorned with two fine pieces of silver, the natives paying great devotion to this superb work, from the wonderful things that have been said to have been effected through the prayers offered up to her of whom this is the semblance.

Being swelled with these, it takes the name of Amotape, from the settlement of this name, situate on its shore. Near its mouth this river is called Colan, and it empties itself into the sea in the corrcgimknto and province ofPiura. The countries which it laves are fertile and beautiful, and its banks are covered with orchards and plantations of sugarcanes of the territory of Loxa.

The inquietudes caused amongst the inhabitants by the infidel Indians induced Don Geronimo Luis de Cabrera, son of a governor of that province, in 1663, to remove it to another not less fertile valley, and to give it the name of San J uan de la Rivero ; and lastly, by the permission of the king, in 1683, it was transferred to a spot in the valley of Catamarca ; where it still remains, under the same title, at 80 leagues distance from its first station. It has, besides the parish church, a convent of the Recoletos monks of St. Francis, with the dedicatory title of San Pedro de Alcantara ; an hospital of Merced ; and a house of residence, which formerly belonged to the regulars of the company of Jesuits. On the w. side of the valley is a mountain in which there are gold mines ; and on the w. also from n. to s. runs a serrama, the skirts of which are for many leagues covered with estates and cultivated grounds, and filled, from the abundance of fine pastures, with lage and small cattle and with mules. A tolerably large river runs through the valley in the rainy season, and terminates in some lakes which are formed by it about 30 leagues s. of the city. The commerce of this city is very small, so that there is no coin current ; and even the payments of the royal duties are paid in effects, and in the productions of the country, such as cotton, linens, pepper, brandy, and wheat.

It is very narrow where it passes through the cities of Popayan and Antioquia, and forms the letter S, taking its course through rocks, which render its na* vigation very dangerous.

[==[[Cavello|CAVELLO]]==, Puerto, Borburata. One league e. of Puerto Cavello, was originally the only resort of vessels trading to this part of Venezuela. Puerto Cavello was merely frequented by smugglers, fishermen, and the outcasts of the interior. The old town is surrounded by the sea, excepting a 6pace of a few fathoms to the w. ; through which they have now cut a canal communicating to the sea on the n. of the town to that on the s. ; thus forming an island, the egress being by a bridge with a gate which is shut every evening, and at which is placed the principal guard. This island being too small for the increasing population, houses were built on a tongue of land to the w. of the town, which was the only part free from inundation ; and this has now become the residence of the merchants, and the principal place. The total population of Puerto Cavello is 7600, of which, excepting the military and the officers of government, none are of the nobility. The whites are generally employed in trade and navigation ; the chief correspondence being with the ports of the continent or the neighbouring colonies ; for, although the port has been open from 1798 to the trade of the metropolis, there is as yet but little communication with it. Of about 60 vessels trading to this place, 20 at least are from Jamaica, and 20 from Curacoa, whilst only four or /five are from Spain . According to the customhouse books, the cargoes of these veesels are of little value ; but the revenue is defrauded, and the vessels discharge their lading on the coast before entering the port. This place supplies all the w. part of Venezuela, C A V and the jurisdiction of Valencia, San Carlos, Bariquisimeto, San Felipe, and a part of the valleys of Aragoa. About 20 Europeans engross the whole trade. All vessels trading to the neighbourhood resort here for repairs, and nothing but the unwholsomeness of the air prevents Puerto Cavello becoming the most important port in America. This insalubrity arises from the exhalations from the rain water that accumulates in a clayey marsh to the s. of the city. It is particularly fatal to those who are not seasoned to the climate. In 1793 a Spanish squadron anchored at Puerto Cavello ; but in six months of its stay, it lost onethird of the crew ; and in 1802 a French squadron iu 20 days lost 161 officers and men. It has been computed that 20,000 piastres fortes would be sufficient to drain this fatal marsh. The inhabitants are supplied by conduits with water from a river that runs into the sea onefourth of a league w. of the town. A military commander is also at the head of the police, and is likewise the administrator of justice, his decisions being subject to an appeal to the royal audience. The people have demanded the establishment of a cabildo, but without success. They obtained in 1800 a single alcalde, who is appointed annually ; but great inconveniences have been found to arise from this arrangement. There is no convent, and but one church, in Puerto Cavello. The foundation of another church was begun, but for want of funds it has not been completed. There is a military hospital, and another for the poor. The garrison consists of a company of the regiment of Caracas in time of peace ; but during war it is reinforced from the militia and troops of the line. There are from 300 to 400 galleyslaves always employed on the public works*

==[[Caxamarca|CAXAMARCA]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru, in the bishopric of Truxillo ; bounded s. e. by the province of Caxamarquilla, e. by that of Chachapoyas, n. w. by that of Luya and Chillaos : all these three being situate at that part of the Maranon which serves as a limit to this province of Caxamarca. It is bounded n. by the province of Jaen, n. w. by that of Piura, w. by that of Sana and by a part of Truxillo, and s. by that of Huamachuco. It is in length 40 leagues from s. e. to n. w. ; and in breadth, or across, 36 leagues. To enter it through the province of Truxillo, which is the grand road, it is necessary to pass the Cordillera, Avhich is not here so lofty as in the s. provinces. This province, however, abounds with eminences which are branches of the cordillera; and on account of the height and situation of these, a great variety of temperature is experienced, some parts being subject to an intense heat, and others to a severe cold. Thus it partakes of the nature of the sierra, and its uneven figure no less corresponds with it : but it is for the most part of a good temperature, particularly in the capital. The province abounds greatly in all kinds of fruits and cattle : in it are fabricated cloths, baizes, blankets, canvas for sails of ships, and cotton garments of a very fine and excellent quality. Formerly its principal commerce was in swine ; at present it is not, though these animals still abound in some parts. It is watered by many rivers, of which those rising on the w. side of the cordillera, as the Sana, Lambayeque, and those passing through the province of Truxillo, all enter the S. sea. The others, amongst which that of the Criznejas is the largest, incoporate themselves with the Marafion. On its shores are lavaderos, or washingplaces Of gold; and its rivers' in general abound in very good and wholesome fish. Besides the fruits and the pro^ ductions of every kind found in this province, it has to boast many gold and silver mines, some of which are worked. There are also some of copper,     very fine lead, brimstone, and alcaparrosa. Towards the n. part, Avhere it touches the province of Jaen, are found some barktrees, the production of which, although not equal to the trees of Loxa, is of the colour of heated copper, and possesses all the virtues of the common bark. Here are also many medicinal herbs, and amongst them the cele  brated calaguala  In the time of the Indians, and  before the conquest, it was so well peopled that its natives formed upwards of 500 settlements. At present they amount to 46,000, being divided into 46settlements. The capital bears the same title, and the repartimiento of the corregidor used to amount to 80,000 dollars, and it paid an alcavala of 640 dollars per annum. The settlements are,

The capital is large and handsome ; its figure is irregular, and it is situate upon a level plain. The houses are of clay, and the streets are wide and straight. The parish church, which has three naves, is of finely worked stone, and the building ex peaces of it were defrayed by King Charles II. in the time of the viceroy the Duke of La Palata, in 1682. It has a parish of Spaniards, called Santa Catalina ; two of Indians, which are San Pedro and San Joseph ; tWO convents of the order of St. Francis, one of the Observers, and another of the- Recoletans ; an hospital and a convent of Belhlemites, a monastery of nuns of La Concepcion, an house of entertainment of Nuestra Senorade  C A X    
Las Mercedes, and an hospital for women. It contains more than 2000 inhabitants, and amongst these many illustrious families, descended from the first conquerors. The Indians here are accounted the most industrious of any in the kingdom. The temperature is mild, and it abounds in fruits and pastures : here are also mines of various metals. Here it was that Atahualpa was put to death by the Spanish, being the last Inca and Emperor of Peru ; and there is still to be seen a stone, of a yard and an half long and twothirds wide, which serves as the foundation to the altar of the chapel where he met his fate. Of this palace, which was for the most part built of mud, but which was very large, and was afterwards converted into the prison, the chapel, and house of the corregidor, called De Cabilch, nothing has been left save a piece of wall of about 12 yards long and eight wide. It has not long been forgotten to what point the Emperor waved his hand, to signify where his pursuers might find the treasure which might secure to him hisliberty. At a league's distance, to the e. of the city, are seen the termas, or baths, as they are called, of the Inca ; the waters of which are not so plenliful as they were formerly, although so hot as to boil an egg ; but the egg, although it appears completely done, will, if put on a common fire to boil, take just as much time as an egg which is perfectly cold ; if kept a day or more it breaks, and the smell and flavour of it, when eaten, is like mud ; but if it be not eaten until it be cold, then its flavour is similar to that of any other egg. On the banks of the stream from whence these waters flow, and in the pools formed by them, there is found a multitude of animalcule, which looked at through a microscope appear like shrimps.

CAXAMARQUILLA y Collaos, a province and corregimiento of Peru, called also Pataz ; bounded e. by the mountains of the infidel Indians, n. e. and n. by the province of Chachapoyas, n.w. by that of Caxamarca, the river Maranon flowing between the two, w. by part of the province of Conchucos, and s. by that of Huaimalies. It is 26 leagues long from n. to s. and six wide, where it extends itself farthest along the e. shore of the river Maranon, which divides this province from those of Conchucos and Huamachuco. Its temperature is various : in the hollows and uneven places it is mild ; in the parts lying upon the above river it is hot, and in the very lofty parts it is cold. The territory is rugged and uneven, and a level spot of ground, or llamira, is scarcely to be seen throughout the whole. On the e. side it is as it were walled in by vexy  lofty and craggy mountains, increasing in height until they gradually reach the loftiest summit: but these are the provident sources of streams which flow down from them into the Maranon, and which, together with the rains, fertilize several spots of land, producing maize, wheat, potatoes, ocas, bark, French beans, herbs, and sugarcane, for the working of which there are mills on the spot. Every kind of cattle is found here in moderation, and the Maranon abounds in fish. Almost all the mountains of this province have in them veins of silver and gold ore : but these are very deceitful, and as well upon this account as from the want of hands, they are for the most part abandoned. The gold mines, however, have always been worked, though the silver mines not more than 20 years back up to now, in which time some riches have been discovered ; and even at the present day the gold mines would produce 600 marks, and those of silver 3000. The trade of the mines is certainly the principal commerce of the place, and it is facilitated by four ports in the Maranon, which afford a convenient opening and communication with the other provinces. The inhabitants of this place scarcely amount to 8000, who live in J 7 settlements. Its repartimiento used to amount to 50,000 dollars, and its ulcavala to 400 dollars per annum.

Caxamarquilla y Collaos, the territory of the missions which forms part of the former province, and which is a reduction of the infidel mountain Indians, who have been converted by the monks of St. Francis : these Indians are maintained by a portion paid by the kind's procurator out of the royal coffers at Lima. They dwell to the e. of the province, and are reduced to four settlements ; two of the Ibita, and two of the Cholona nation. It is now 90 years since their foundation, and the number of Indians may at present amount to 2000. These settlements are situate upon mountains covered with trees and thick woods ; from whence the natives procure incense, cacao, resinous gums, oil of Maria, dragon's blood, the reed called bejuco, dried fish, honey, wax, monkeys, parrots, and macaws, which are the branches of its commerce ; though not less so is the coca plant, which they pack up in measures of four bushels each, and carry in abundance to different parts, for the consumption of the whole province. The missionaries of the above order have made various attempts, and have spared neither pains nor labour in penetrating into the interior parts of the mountains ; having repeatedly discovered other barbarous nations, whom they would fain have reduced to the divine knowledge of the gospel. 
The aforesaid settlements are, Jesus de Sion, San Buenaventura, 
Jesus de Ochonache, Pisano. 

==[[Caxatambo|CAXATAMBO]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru, bounded n. by that of Huailas, n. e. by that of Conchuios, e. by that of Huamalies, s. e. by that of Tarma, s. by the part of Chancay called Checras, s. e. by the low part of Chancay, and n. w. by that of Santa. It is in length 34 leagues n. e. s. w. and 32 in width n. w. s. e. ; the greater part of it is situate in a serrania. Its temperature is consequently cold,except in the broken and uneven spots and in the low lands. Besides the productions peculiar to the serrania, this province abounds in all sorts of seeds and fruits; in all species of cattle, especially of the sheep kind, from the fleece of Avhich its inhabitants manufacture much cloth peculiar to the country ; this being the principal source of its commerce. It produces some grain and cochineal, used for dyes ; and if this latter article were cultivated, it would bring great profit. Amongst the mountains of this province there is one called Huilagirca of fine flint, and two mines of sulphurand alcaparrosa, articles employed in the colouring of wools, not only in this province, 
YOL. I.    but in those of Huanuco, Huamalies, and Jauja ; It has also mines of good yeso or gypsum. The principal rivers by which it is irrigated, are two which rise in the same soil, and both of which enter the S. sea, after having laved the contiguous provinces : in former times there were fine silver mines, which are still worked, but for some reason or other, to very little profit. On the n. e. part, on some eminences, is a spot called Las Ties Cruces, (The Three Crosses), there being as many of these fixed up here to determine its boundaries, and that of the province of Santa Huailas. Its population consists of the 69 following settlements : its repartimiento used to amount to 130,000 dollars, and the akavala to 1046 dollars per annum.

[==[[Cayahaga|CAYAHAGA|Cayuga]]==, sometimes called the Great River, empties in at the s. bank of lake Erie, 40 miles e. of the mouth of Huron ; having an Indian town of the same name on its banks. It is navigable for boats ; and its mouth is wide, and deep enough to receive large sloops from the lake. Near this are the celebrated rocks which project over the lake. They are several miles in length, and rise 40 or 50 feet perpendicular out of the water. Some parts of them consist of several strata of different colours, lying in a horizontal direction, and so exactly parallel, that they resemble the work of art. The view from the land is grand, but the water presents the most magnificent prospect of this sublime work of nature ; it is attended, however, with great danger ; for if the least storm arises, the force of the surf is such that no vessel 2  can escape being dashed to pieces against the rocks. Colonel Broadshead suffered shipwreck here in the late war, and lost a number of his men, when a strong wind arose, so that the last canoe narrowly escaped. The heathen Indians, when they pass this impending danger, offer a sacrifice of tobacco to the water. Part of the boundary line between the United States of America and the Indians begins at the mouth of Cayahaga, and runs up the same to the portage between that and the Tuscarawa branch of the Muskingum. The Cayuga nation, consisting of 500 Indians, 40 of whom reside in the United States, the rest in Canada, receive of the state of New York an annuity of 2300 dollars, besides 50 dollars granted to one of their chiefs, as a consideration for lands sold by them to the state, and 500 dollars from the United States, agreeably to the treaty of 1794. See Six Nations.] 
==[[Cayenne|CAYENNE]]==, a large island of the province and government of Guayana : it is six leagues in length from n. to s. and three quarters of a league in its broadest part. On the n. side it has the sea, on the w. the river Cayenne, on the e. the Ouya, and on the s. an arm which is formed by this and the Orapu. The soil is excellent, fertile, and irrigated by many streams. That part which looks to the n. is the most pleasant and healthy ; and in it are many mountains well cultivated and covered with country seats. The part facing the s. is much lower, and abounds in meadows, called sabanas, and which are inundated in the rainy seasons. The point of the island formed by the mouth of the river Cayenne, is called Caperoux, where there is a fortress with a French garrison, and below this a convenient and large port, capable of containing in security 100 ships. The French established themselves in this island in the year 1625, and abandoned it in 1654, when the English entered it, and were routed by Mr. de la Barre, in the year 1664. The Dutch had their revenge in 1676 : but the year following it was recovered by the French, under the command of D'Estrees, on whom the celebrated Jesuit Carlos de la Rue made the following inscription : Joanni 
Comiti Estrceo 
Vice Ameralio Cayana. Tabaco 
* VI. Captis 
Balavorum 
Americana classe deleta 
Colonii. excisis. [The capitulation of Cayenne to the English arms, in conjunction with the Portuguese, took  C A Z  place on the 12th of January 1809 ; the English in this brave contest having been commanded by Lieutenantcolonel Marques, and Captain Yeo.] Besides the capital there are in this island the towns of Armire, inhabited by Jews, as likewise those of Matuiri, Matahuri, Courrou, and Conanama, inhabited by French, Negroes, Mustees, and Mulattoes ; but few by Indians, these living for the most part retired in the mountains and woods to the s. These towns were converted to the faith by the society of the Jesuits, who had here established a mission, which afterwards fell to decay. 
[The province of Cayenne is bounded on the n. by the Dutch colony of Surinam ; w. by the woods and mountains inhabited by barbarians, and s. by the country of the Portuguese on the borders of the Maranon.j The principal rivers which water it, and which empty themselves into the Atlantic ocean, are the Cabo, Apurvaca, Cayenne, Vuya, and Barca. Its chief commerce is in sugar, which is manufactured in various mills by the Negroes. [In 1752 the exports of the colony were 260,541 lbs. of arnotto, 80,365 lbs. sugar, 17,919 lbs. cotton, 26,881 lbs. coffee, 91,916 lbs. cacao, beside timber and planks.]

Others pretend that the Arucanos, after they had destroyed the city of Osonio, in 1599, took away with them the Spanish women ; and that it was from the production of these women and the Indians that this nation of the Cesares arose. Certain it is, that they are of an agreeable colour, of a pleasing aspect, and of good dispositions. They have some light of Christianity, live without any fixed abode ; and some have affirmed that they have heard the sound of bells in their territory. It was attempted in 1658, by the governor of Tucuman, Don Geronimo  side is a large estate called   Luis de Cabrera, to make an effectual discovery of this nation, but lie did not succeed. In 1662 the innermost part of this country Mas penetrated by Father Geronimo Montemayor, of the extinguished company of Jesuits.

==[[Chacfiapoias|CHACFIAPOIAS]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru ; bounded e. and s. by the mountains of the infidel Indians, n. no. by the provinces of Luya and Chillaos, and no. by Caxamarca. Its greatest length is 38 leagues from n. no. to s. e. and its breadth is nearly as great. Its temperatuse is for the most part mild, though in some places exceedingly hot, and in others equally cold, since a branch of the Cordillera intersects it. Upon this account also it abounds greatly in all productions, such as wheat, maize, and other seeds, and in all kinds of herbs and fruits. It produces a good proportion of sugar ; but the principal sources of its commerce are cotton and tobacco ; these productions belonging peculiarly to the district of Mayobamba, three leagues distant to the s. e. and being held in great estimation. The women spin cotton, of which they manufacture canvass for the sails of ships, also for bags : they spin likewise another sort of delicate thread, of which they make linen for garments ; the men employing themselves in the looms and in the cultivation of cotton and tobacco: of this they used to gather yearly 600 measures, consisting of 200 mazos or rollos each, each mazo being valued at one real. At present less is cultivated, from the prohibition of commerce, so that the settlement has become much poorer, and the price of the cotton for making sails is now at two reals per lb. ; though that which is very fine, at a dollar. As there is no current coin, the inhabitants make barters in kind for the necessaries they want. Thus also they pay their tributes, duties, and taxes ; and the treaties amongst them for canvass and linen cloths are consequently very large, the prices being regulated amongst themselves. They cultivate coca, and with this they supply some of the neighbouring provinces.   They breed cattle of every sort, horses, sheep, and cows ; of whose hides, when tanned and dried by the fire, they manufacture trunks, saddles, chests, &amp;c. It has but a few mines, and of these, one only is gold, and a few of salt are worked. It is watered by several rivers ; but the principal are the Moyobamba and the Uccubamba. Its inhabitants amount to 10,000, and are divided into 43 settlements. Its repartimiento amounted to 32,000 dollars ; and it paid nearly 256 for alcavala. San Juan de la Fron- Nixaque,

==[[Chacna|CHACNA]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Aimaraez in Peru ; annexed to the curacy of Colcabamba. 
==[[Chaco|CHACO]]==, a province of the kingdom of Peru, called the Gran Chaco, is an extensive country ; having as its boundary to the e. the river Paraguay, and being bounded on the \n.e. by the province of the Chiquitos Indians ; on the n. by that of Santa Cruz de la Sierra ; on the w. it touches upon the provinces of Mizque, Tomina, Pomabamba, Pilaya, Paspaya, Tarija, and Tucuman. On the s. it extends as far as the jurisdiction of the government of Buenos Ayres, which is its farthest limits. Towards the n. it is 150 leagues wide from e. to w.. and 250 leagues long from n. to s. ; but to make these distances, it requires many months, owing to the unevenness and roughness of the territory. It is called Chaco, or, with more propriety, Chacu, which, in the Quechuan language, signifies junta, or company, from the circumstance of its having been formed of Indians of several countries, who had fled from the conquering arms of the Incas, and afterwards from those of the Spaniards. Towards the w. it has some serranias, which are branches of the cordillera ; where, on account of their immense height, the cold is very great ; but in the low grounds, which are for the most part plains, the temperature is hot. It is full of thick woods, and in many parts is swampy and wet ; particularly in the part lying towards the e. on the road to Paraguay. In the wet season, which lasts from the month of November to April, the rivers leave their beds and form various lakes, some of which dry up, and some remain. This province has some rivers of note ; such are the Salado and the Bermejo ; is one of the most fertile provinces in America, and would, if it were cultivated, afford, in the greatest abundance, those productions wnich are now thrown away upon the infinite number of barbarous na- C H A   tions who inhabit it. It produces a great variety of fine woods and fruittrees; such as walnuts and nuts, although different from those of Europe, but which are extremely well tasted ; beautiful cedars ; quebrachos, thus called on account of their hardness ; guaj/acanes, carobtrees, balsams, marias palms, some of which are more than SO yards in height; almonds, cacaos, ceibas, which are very large trees, bearing in the pods a remarkable soft wool, used for quilts, since it cannot be spun ; cottontrees, mistoles, of the heart of which the Indians make darts and cimeters ; myrrh, sarzafraztrees, bark, and others, which have the interior bark so delicate and white as occasionally to serve instead of writing paper ; others there are, which, at one or two yards up their stems, form a kind of barrel or pipe, and being of a very tough bark, are accustomed to be ripped open by the Indians, and thus serve as vessels, in which these keep their liquor called chic ha ; it is from this that they whimsically call this plant pah borracho, or drunken tree. In this province are found also canes for walking sticks, as fine as those of Asia ; and in the trunks of trees, in holes of the rocks and below the ground, are quantities of honey and wax wrought by bees, of which there are reckoned to be more than 12 sorts : some of the wax, besides being transparent, is extremely fragrant and delicious to the taste, whilst some is so sour as to resemble the juice of boiled lemons. One sort of these bees fabricate, with great skill, excellent hives of mud upon the branches of trees, and of the shape of a decanter, which are so hard that they will not break in falling down upon the ground ; they, morever, are filled with exquisite wax and wellflavoured honey. The fruittrees which this province produces, are oranges, cedars, lemons, apples, pears, melocotones, (or peaches engrafted on quinces), figs, nuts, prunes, and olives, also passionflowers ; all of which have been brought hither from the city of Santiago de Guadalcazar. Here are palms which have cups containing 25 kernels each, differing only slightly from the palms of Europe by having a flavour of the cocoa, and being somewhat larger. Here is also a plant called chahuar, having prickles like the savine, of which are made threads similar to hemp, for the manufacture of nets, bags, and some sorts of coarse garments : its root serves as food for the Indians, as do also yucas, potatoes, and others- It has an innumerable quantity of birds, namely, wild pigeons, ducks, herons, mountainpeacocks, pheasants, crows, condors, partridges, falcons,, swans, periguanaSf ostriches, parrots, and one kind of bird which exactly imitates an organ, and z z  sm     another whose note resembles atrumpet. It abounds in quadrupeds, as mules, horses, and cattle of the large and small kind, the antas, which is called here gran bestia, (great beast), huanacos, vicunas, llamas, or native sheep, stags, bears, anteaters, wild bears, otters, tigers, mountain cats, visca- •ends, (or large hares), large and small foxes, tortoises, higuanos, and others ; all of which afford food to the voracious Indians. In this province are also found many insects, such as scorpions, vipers, snakes of several kinds, some of two heads, and some with rattles, squirrels, mocamucas, ampalabas, or what are called in other countries owls, which are extremely deformed, and attract small animals to them by their screeching, quiriquinchos of various sorts, glowworms, a great variety of flics and spiders, and of these a large kind very venomous, silkworms, which, if taken care of, would yield an abundance of silk, locusts, which are eaten bythe Indians both dry andfresh ; also ants, the beds of which are so deep as to render the road dangerous for men and for horses to pass, these insects being of such an undaunted and troublesome nature as often to attack a viper or locust in large bodies, and in some settlements to enter a house like a plundering army, devouring every insect and worm in their way, not leaving a single eatable thing untouched ; scarcely shall these have finished their operations, but they are succeeded by another band, and indeed it is very hazardous to disturb them, since they bite very fiercely and cause much pain. This province has no mines, although it is said that formerly some were worked by the Indians ; some little time since, however, one of iron was discovered, when it was thought to have been of gold. This extensive and pleasant country is inhabited by a multitude of infidel Indians, of different nations and of various barbarous customs. It was casually discovered in 1586 by Juan de Banos, a native of Chuquisaca, a factor ofthe settlement of Yala; he had an Indian slave who used frequently to run away from his master for a time and return again, and who being asked once whither he went, replied to Chacu ; this it was that led to its discovery, and to the subsequent attempts at several times made to conquer it; first by Martin de Ledesma, afterwards by Juan Manso, Don Pedro Lasarte, and lastly by D &gt;n Christoval de Sanabri, all of which were mefi'ectual. San Francisco Solano entered the country, and succeeded in reducing some ofthe natives to the Christian faith ; these, however, soon returned to their idolatry. The regulars of the company of Jesuits likewise engaged themselves in the reduction of this country in 15S7, the first of their   preachers here being Father Alonzo Barzana, called the apostle of Peru ; they continued here for a number of years, and during their stay founded seven settlements. The inhabitants of the whole province are computed at 100,000. Catalogue of the nations which inhabit Chaco. Chiriguanas, Abayas, Churumutas, Yapayaes,

[The Chactaws, or Flatheads, are a powerful, hardy, subtle, and intrepid race of Indians, who inhabit a very fine and extensive tract of hilly country, with large and fertile plains intervening, between the Alabama and Mississippi rivers, and in the w. part of the state of Georgia. This nation had, not many years ago, 43 towns and villages, in three divisions, containing 12,123 souls, of which 4041 were fighting men. They are called by the traders Flatheads, all the males having the fore and hind part of their skulls artificially flattened when young. These men, unlike the Muscogulges, are slovenly and negligent in every part of their dress, but otherwise are said to be ingenious, sensible, and virtuous men, bold and intrepid, yet quiet and peaceable. Some late travellers, however, have observed that they pay little attention to the most necessary rules of moral conduct, at least that unnatural crimes were too frequent among them. Different from most of the Indian nations bordering on the United States, they have large plantations or country farms, where they employ much of their time in agricultural improvements, after the manner of the white people. Although their territories are not onefourth so large as those of the Muscogulge confedracy, the number of inhabitants is greater. The Chactaws and Creeks are inveterate enemies to each other. There are a considerable number of these Indians on the as. side of the Mississippi, who have not been home for several years. About 12 miles above the post at Oacheta on that river, there is a small village of them of about 30 men, who have lived there for several years, and made corn ; and likewise on Bayau Chico, in the n. part of the district of Appalousa, there is another village of them of about fifty men, who have been there for about nine years, and say they have the governor of   Louisiana's permission to settle there. Besides these, there are rambling hunting parties of them to be met with all over Lower Louisiana. They are at war with the Caddoques, and liked by neither red nor white people.] [Chactaw Hills, in the n. w. corner of Georgia river.]

The lands they claim on Bayau Bceuf are inferior to no part of Louisiana in depth and richness of soil, growth of timber, pleasantness of surface, and goodness of water. The Bayau Bceuf falls into the GhafFeli, and discharges through Appalousa and Attakapa into Vermilion bay.]

It is said to have taken its latter name from a mill with 18 saws, moved by one wheel, erected by one Lodors. But the project was soon laid aside. The former name is derived from Mr. Chadbourne, one of the first settlers, who purchased the land on the mouth of it, of the natives, and whose posterity possess itatthis day.]

It is navigated by large vessels called chatas, (having no keels), tip as far as the settlement of Cruces, where is the wharf for un  lading, and the royal customhouses ; the greater part of the commerce being conducted by this means, to avoid the obstacles occurring from a bad and rocky road from Portobelo to Panama. It has different forts for the defence of its entrance ; the first is the castle of its name, at the entrance or mouth ; the second is that of Gatun, situate upon a long strip of land formed by a river of this name ; and the third is that of Trinidad, situate in a.simU z z 2  C H A  lar way by a river of its name. It abounds in large alligators and mosquitoes, which render its navigation very troublesome. Its shores are covered witli beautiful trees, which are inhabited by a variety of birds and apes of several species, which make an incredible chattering and noise. It was by this river that the pirate John Morgan came when he took and sacked Panama in 1670. It was discovered by Hernando de la Serma in 1527, when he called it the river of Lagartos, but its mouth was before discovered by Lope de Olano in 1510. Here are found, at certain seasons, a very small fish of the size of a pin, called titles, and these are so abundant, that putting into the water a large basket, it is certain to be drawn out full ; they arc fried, and make very savoury fritters. Chagre, with the dedicatory title of San Lorenzo, a settlement of the same province and kingdom ; situate upon the top of a mountain at the entrance or mouth of the former river. It has for its defence a strong castle, which was built by the order of Philip II. by the famous engineer Juan Bautista Antoneli. This was taken by the pirate John Morgan, after having made a glorious defence, in 1668, when the settlement was burnt and sacked ; and in 1740 it was taken by the English, commanded by Admiral Vernon, who entirely destroyed it ; its loss in that war being supplied by two strong batteries, which hindered the English from making a breach, for the third time, when they came with three frigates of war : but they were driven back by Captain Don Juan de Hermida, who was formerly captain of the regiment of Granada. In 1752 this castle was rebuilt, in the most perfect manner, by the lieutenantgeneral and engineer Don lgnatio de Sala, governor of Cartagena, who came hither for this purpose by order' of the king. In this fortress several personages of distinction have been held prisoners, and amongst others the Marquis of La Mina, president, governor, and captaingeneral of the kingdom in 1694.

It was conquered by Don Juan de Ibarra in 1554, has many mines of silver and gold, which were formerly worked, but which at present are all abandoned, as well from their having filled with water, as from the scantiness of the means of the inhabitants to work them. The royal mines, however, are productive of some emolument, and are in fact the support of the place. It produces some maize, and much tobacco and cotton, to which article the soil is exactly suited, though not so to wheat, which yields here but sparingly. On the banks of" the lakes formed by the sea, is left a thick incrustation of salt in the month of April ; and although the inhabitants spare no pains to collect this valuable commodity, yet abundance of it is lost from the want of hands to collect it ere the heats come on, when it very quickly disappears.  Some large cattle are bred here. It is very badly peopled, or, to speak more truly, it is as it were desert, having only three settlements and some estates. It is irrigated by a river which flows down from the sierra Madre, and passes through the capital, the waters of which are made useful for the working of the mines.

It was granted to some Canadian and Nova Scotia refugees, who were  C H A   either in the service of the United States during the war, or fled to them for protection. The indigence or ill habits of these people occasioned the breaking up of the settlement, and a better sort of inhabitants have now taken their place. The lands are fertile, and two rivers run through it, well stored with fish. It has 575 inhabitants, and three slaves. By the state census of 1796, 76 of the inhabitants are electors.] Champlatn, a lake of the same province, of more than 20 leagues in length, and from 10 to 12 in width, abounding in excellent fish. It was discovered in 1609 by a French gentleman of the name of Champlain, who gave it his name, which it still retains. It communicates with a smaller lake called Sacrament, and the canal passing from one side to the other of these is extremely rapid and dangerous, fromthe inequality of its bottom. At the distance of 25 leagues to the s. are some very lofty mountains, which are covered with snow, and in which are found castors and a variety of animals of the chase ; and between these mountains and the aforesaid lake are some beautiful level meadows or llanuras, which, when first discovered, were well peopled with Iioquees Indians ; but these have greatly diminished in numbers, through the continual wars with the French and English. [This lake is next in size to lake Ontario, and lies e. n. e. from it, forming a part of the dividing line between the states of New York and Vermont. It took its name from a French governor, who was drowned in it ; it was before called Corker's lake. Reckoning its length from Fairhaven to St. John's, a course nearly n. it is about 200 miles ; its breadth is from one to 18 miles, being very different in different places ; the mean width is about five miles, and it occupies about 500,000 acres : its depth is sufficient for the largest vessels. There are in it above sixty islands of different sizes : the most considerable are North and South Hero and Motte island. North Hero, or Grand isle, is 24 miles long, and from two to four wide. It receives at Ticonderoga the waters of lake George from the s. s. w. which is said to be 100 feet higher than the waters of this lake. Half the rivers and streams which rise in Vermont fall into it. There are several which come to it from New York state, and some from Canada ; to which last it sends its own waters a n. course, through Sorell or Chamblee river, into the St. Lawrence. This lake is well stored with fish, particularly salmon, salmon trout, sturgeon, and pickerel, and the land on its borders, and on the banks of its rivers, is good. The rocks in several places appear to be marked and stained with the former surface of the lake, many feet higher than   it has been since its discovery in 1608. The waters generally rise from about the 20th of April to the 20th of June, from four to six feet ; the greatest variation is not more than eight feet. It is seldom entirely shut up with ice until the middle of January. Between the 6th and 15th of April the ice generally goes off, and it is not uncommon for many square miles of it to disappear in one day.] 

CH ==[[Ample|AMPLE]]==, a large unpeopled tract of the province of Taraumara, and kingdom of Nueva yizcaya, in which there is a mountain abounding greatly in silver mines.

==[[Chancay|CHANCAY]]==, a province and corregimiento of the kingdom of Peru ; bounded n. by that of Santa ; n. e. and n. by that of Caxatambo ; e. by that of Cauta ; and s. by the corregimiento of Cercado. It is 27 leagues in length from n. to s. and the same in width e. w. and has on its coast some ports and creeks not remarkable for their security. It comprehends in its district two territories, one of a cold temperature towards the cordillera, called De los Checras; and another of a warm temperature, lying in the valleys towards the sea, called De Chancay. It is irrigated by two rivers, one on the s. side, called Pasamayo, and the other Huama, on the n. The latter has an arched bridge, which was built in the time of the viceroy, the Marquis de Montes Claros, the buttresses of which are two rocks, through which the river passes. On the e. and in the cold part of this province, are found the productions peculiar to the climate, such as papas, ocas, and some wheat and maize. Here are also cattle, of the fleeces of which  C H  the natives make friezes. The low part, looking upon the coast, enjoys a temperature equal in mildness to that of Lima. It is very fertile, and in the many estates which are in it maize grows in great quantities, and it, besides serving as food for the labourers, and independent of that which is devoured by the wild pigeons with which those fields are filled, serves to fatten numbers of pigs, which are carried to supply the markets of Lima ; those animals, one year with another, amounting to 22,000 head, and producing an emolument of 300,000 dollars to the proprietors of the estates. Here are also some estates of sugarcane, and others of French beans and wheat, of which the crops were formerly very great, and used, together with the vines, to be reckoned amongst the chief productions of this country, though they have now made room for a more general cultivation of maize. What conduces much to render the soil fertile, is what the Indians call huano, and which, in their language, signifies dung, this being brought from some small islands at a little distance from the coast towards the n. It is thought to be the excrement of some birds called huanaes&gt; who have been accustomed to deposit it in the above places from time immemorial. Some of it has also been found in various other islands of the coast of Canete, Arica, and others. Of this it is certain, that a handful being put at the root of a plant of maize, it becomes so invigorated as to produce upwards of 200 for one, and that not less than 90,000 bushels of this valuable manure is used yearly. In the centre of the province, and upon the coast, are some fine salines, which supply some of the neighbouring districts ; and amongst the rest, those of Canta, Tarma, Caxatambo, Huamalies, Huanuco, Conchuco, and Huailas, are the most noted. The salt is not only used in the working of the metals, but for preserving the cattle from a venomous insect called afowya, which preys upon their entrails until it destroys them.

==[[Charcana|CHARCANA]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Parinacochas in Peru. 
==[[Charcas|CHARCAS]]==, an extensive province of the king= dom of Peru, composed of various others. Its jurisdiction comprehends the district of this royal audience, which begins at Vilcanota, of the corregimiento of Lampa and bishopric of Cuzco, and extends as far as Buenos Ayres to the s. It is bounded on the e. by Brazil, the meridian serving as a limit ; and reaching w. as far as the corregimiento of Atacama, which is of its district, and forms the most n. part of this province in that direction, and being closed in on its other sides by the kingdom of Chile : is 300 leagues in length, including the degrees of latitude from 20° to 28° s. : is in many parts very thinly peopled, and covered with large desert tracts, and rugged and impenetrable mountains, and again by the elevated Cordilleras of the Andes, and the spacious llanuras or pampas,which serve to mark its size and the relative distances of its territories. Its temperature throughout is extremely cold, although there are not wanting parts which enjoy a moderate warmth. At the time that this province was in the possession of the Indians, and previous to the entrance of the Spaniards, many wellinhabited provinces v/ent jointly under the name of Charcas ; and the conquest of these was first undertaken by Capac Yupanqui, fifth Emperor ; but he was not able to pass the territory of the Tutiras Indians and of Chaqui. Here it was that his conquests terminated : nor did the subjection of these parts extend farther than Collaysuyo until after his death, when he was succeeded by his son the Inca Roca, sixth Emperor, who carried on still farther the victories which had been already gained, conquering all the nations as far on as that of Chuquisaca, where he afterwards founded the city of this name, called also LaPIata. After that the Spaniards had reduced that part of Peru, extending from Tumbez to Cuzco, and that the civil wars and dissensions which existed between these were at an end, they endeavoured to follow up their enterprise by making a conquest of the most distant nations. To this end, in 1538, Gonzalo Pizarro sallied forth with a great force, and attacking the Charcas and the Carangues, found in them such a spirited opposition, that after several battles he was brought to think this object was nearly impracticable : this idea was strengthened by the reception he had met with from the Chuquisacas, who in many conflicts had given him convincing proofs of their valour and warlike spirit; indeed it is thought, that had he not just   R C A S.  at that critical moment received fresh succours, that were sent from Cuzco by his brother the Marquis Don Francisco Pizarro, he would have fallen a sacrifice, with the whole of the Spanish army, to that undertaking : but being invigorated by this,assistance, he succeeded in routing the Indians, and in obliging them to surrender to the Spanish government. In 1539 the Marquis Don Francisco Pizarro, seeing the importance of making an establishment here, resolved upon building of a town, giving a commission to Captain Pedro Auzures to execute the same. This person actually put into effect the plan suggested, founding the town in exactly the same spot in which formerly stood the settlement of Chuquisaca. Here many of its conquerors settled and became citizens, and they gave it the name of La Plata, or Silver, from some mines of this metal which are found in the mountain of Porco, which lies at a small distance from this city, and from which the Inca Emperors were accustomed to extract immense emolument. Notwithstanding this name it has never lost its original title, Chuquisaca, although indeed it is badly pronounced by the Spaniards ; since the Indians, and with great propriety, will have it Choquezaca, Choquechaca, or Choquisacha; all of which,however pronounced, signify,thefirst,mountains of gold ; the second, cunchos of gold, or fields of brambles with yellow twigs ; and the third, bridges of gold. Although this province is extensive, it is composed of various others, which we shall notice under their proper heads. This keeps its present name, from being the one of all the others the most abounding in minerals, seeds, and cattle ; as well as being the one best peopled with Indians. It is watered by many large rivers; and the whole of it composes an archbishopric, to ,which are suffragan the bishoprics of La Paz, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Tucuman, Paraguay, and Buenos Ayres. It belongs to the viceroyalty of this latter place since the time that this was erected, and that the government was entrusted to the royal audience established in 1559. The aforesaid district comprehends in its jurisdiction all the following provinces and corregimientos :   Tomino, Porco,  Cochabamba, 
Chayanta, 
Paria, 
Carangas, 
Cicasica, 
Atacama :

Amparaez,

Pilaya, In which are contained 188 settlements and curacies, in which there were in 1651 about 100,000 Indians.

==[[Charleston|CHARLESTON]]==, a capital city of S. Carolina, is one of the best of N. America, excelling in beauty, grandeur, and commerce. It is situate upon a long strip of land between two navigable rivers, which are Ashley and Cowper, and the greater part of it upon the latter. This forms in the city two small bays, the one to the n. and the other to the s. The town is of a regular construction, and well fortified both by nature and art, having six bastions and a line of entrenchment : on the side of" the river Cowper it has the bastions of   Black, Granville, Craven, and a halfmoon ; on the n. a line, and in front of the river Ashley the bastion of Colliton, and the covered halfmoon of Johnson, with a drawbridge to pass the line, and another to pass the halfmoon. Besides these works of regular fortification, it has a fort erected upon a point of land at the entrance of the river Ashley, which commands the channel and the vessels : but the bastions, the palisade, and the ditch on the landside, having suffered much damage in an hurricane, and it being thought by the Governor Nicholson, that they were of too great an extent to defend themselves, they were by his command destroyed. This city is, as it were, a continual fair, being the market for the fruits of the whole province : the streets are well projected, and the edifices are grand and of fine architecture, especially the church, which is magnificent, spacious, and one of the best in all N . America : there are several other churches belonging to different sects, and the French protestants have a very fine one in the principal street. The town consists of 800 houses built of wood as to the greater part, although there are some of stone ; all of them having glass windows, and manifesting a degree of elegance and ornament in their structure : is the residence of the governor of the province, and in it is held the general assembly and the tribunal of judicature. Here are many rich nobles and opulent merchants, and almost all its inhabitants exhibit a costly appearance, and live in a state of consummate luxury. It has a public library, which owes its establishment to Doctor Thomas Bray. The liberty of conscience enjoyed in this city, and which was granted to its inhabitants a short time after its foundation, caused it to become very populous. This effect was further heightened by the extensive commerce it enjoyed ; and thus has it, with many other qualities of preeminence, become one of the finest settlements in America. 
[Charleston, the metropolis of S. Carolina, is the most considerable town in the state : situate in the district of the same name, and on the tongue of land formed by the confluent streams of Ashley and Cowper, which are short rivers, but large and navigable. These waters unite immediately below the city, and form a spacious and convenient harbour, which communicates with the ocean just below Sullivan's island, which it leaves on the n. seven miles s. e. of Charleston. In these rivers the tide rises in common about six feet and a half; but uniformly rises 10 or 12 inches more during a night tide. The fact is certain ; the cause unknown. The continual agitation which the tides occasion in the waters which almost surround Charleston,   the refreshing seabreezes which are regularly felt, and the smoke arising from so many chimneys, render this city more healthy than any part of the low country in the s. states. On this account it is the resort of great numbers of gentlemen invalids from the W. India islands, and of the rich planters from the country, who come here to spend the sickly months, as they are called, in quest of health and of the social enjoyments which the city affords ; and in no part of America are the social blessings enjoyed more rationally and liberally than here.

Do. of thunder

In speaking of the capital, it ought to be observed, for the honour of the people of Carolina in general, that when, in common with the other colonies, in the contest with Britain, they resolved against the use of certain luxuries, and even necessaries of life, those articles which improve the mind, enlarge the understanding, and correct the taste, were excepted ; the importation of books was permitted as formerly. The land on which the town is built is flat and low, and the water brackish and unwholesome. The streets are pretty regularly cut, and open beautiful prospects, and have subterranean drains to carry oiF filth and keep]  C H A    
[the city clean and healthy ; but are too narrow for so large a place and so 'warm a climate. Their general breadth is from 35 to 66 feet. The houses which have been lately built are brick with tiled roofs. The buildings in general are elegant, and most of them are neat, airy, and well furnished. The public buildings are, an exchange, a statehouse, an armoury, &amp; poorhouse, and an orphan's house. Here are several respectable academies. Part of the old barracks has been handsomely fitted up, and converted into a college, and there are a number of students ; but it can only be called as yet a respectable academy. Here are two banks ; a branch of the national bank, and the S. Carolina bank, established in 1792. The houses for public worship are, two Episcopal churches, two for Independents, one for Scotch Presbyterians, one for Baptists, one for German Lutherans, two for Methodists, one for French Protestants, a meetinghouse for Quakers, a Roman Catholic chapel, and a Jewish synagogue. Little attention is paid to the public markets ; a great proportion of the most wealthy inhabitants having plantations, from which they receive supplies of almost every article of living. The country abounds with poultry and wild ducks. Their beef, mutton, and veal are not generally of the best kind ; and few fish are found in the market. In 1787 it was computed that there were 1600 houses in this city, and 15,000 inhabitants, including 5400 slaves ; and what evinces the healthiness of the place, upwards of 200 of the white inhabitants were above 60 years of age. In 1791 there were 16,359 inhabitants, of whom 7684 were slaves. This city has often suffered much by fire ; the last and most destructive happened as late as June 1796. Charleston was incorporated in 1783, and divided into three wards, which choose as many wardens, from among whom the citizens elect an intendant of the city. The intendant and wardens form the citycouncil, who have power to make and enforce byelaws for the regulation of the city. The value of exports from this port, in the year ending November 1787, amounted to 505,279?. 19s. 5c?. sterling. The number of vessels cleared from the customhouse the same year was 947, measuring 62,118 tons; 735 of these, measuring 41,531 tons f were American ; the others belonged to Great Britain, Ireland, Spain, France, and the United Netherlands. In the year 1794 the value of exports amounted to 3,846,392 dollars . It is 60 miles s. w. by s. of Georgetown, 150 e. by s. of Augusta, 497 s. by w. of Richmond, 630 s. w. by s. of Washington city ; 763 s. w. by s. of Philadelphia, and 1110 s. w. of Boston. Lat. 32° 48'. Long. 80° 2' w. Knoxville, the capital of the state  of Tennessee, is much nearer to this than to any seaport town in the Atlantic ocean. A waggon road of only 15 miles is wanted to open the communication ; and the plan is about to be executed by the state.] 
Charleston, another capital city of the county of Middlesex in New England; situate on the bank of the river Charles. It is well peopled and of a good construction, occupying the whole of the space which lies between the aforesaid river and that of Mystic, the former river dividing the city from Boston, in the same manner as the Thames divides London from Southwark. It has a raft for the traffic of the river instead of a bridge, the fare or produce of which belongs to the college of Norwood in the city of Cambridge, which is close by : this city is as it were the half of Boston, and its situation, as being upon a peninsula, is very advantageous. At certain times it has fairs, and is the meeting place for the assembly of the county. It has a very large and handsome church, and a marketplace, ornamentally and conveniently situate on the river side, at which there are sold all kinds of flesh, fish, and other necessaries : it has two large streets leading to it. The river is navigable, and runs through the country for many leagues. Is in Lat. 42° 24' n. Long. 71° 6' w. 

[==[[Charlestown|CHARLESTOWN]]==, the principal town in Middlesex county, Massachusetts, called Mishawun by the aboriginal inhabitants, lies n. of Boston, with which it is now connected by Charles river bridge. The town, properly so called, is built on a peninsula formed by Mystic river on the e. and a bay setting up from Charles river on the w. It is very advantageously situated for health, navigation, trade, and manufactures of almost all the various kinds. A dam across the moxith of the bay, ■which sets up from Charles river, would afford a great number of millseats for manufactures. Bunker's, Breed's, and Cobble (now Barrell's) hills, are celebrated in the history of the American revolution. The second hill has upon its summit a monument erected to the memory of Majorgeneral Warren, near the spot where he fell, among the first sacrifices to American liberty. The brow of the hill begins to be ornamented with elegant houses. All these hills afford elegant and delightful prospects of Boston, and its charmingly variegated harbour, of Cambridge and its colleges, and of an extensive tract of highly cultivated country. It contains within the neck or parish about 250 houses, and about 2000 inhabitants. The only public buildings of consequence are, a handsome Congregational church, with an elegant steeple and clock, and an almshouse, very commodious   and pleasantly situated. Before the destruction of this town by the British in 1775, several branches of manufactures were carried on to great advantage, some of which have been since revived : particularly the manufacture of pot and pearl ashes, shipbuilding, rum, leather in all its branches, silver, tin, brass, and pewter. Three ropewalks have lately been erected in this town, and the increase of its houses, population, trade, and navigation, have been very great within a few years past. This town is a port of entry in conjunction with Boston. At the head of the neck there is a bridge over Mystic river, which connects Charlestown with Maiden.] Charlestown, another city of the island of Nevis, one of the Caribes, in the Antilles ; in which there are beautiful houses and shops well provided •with every thing ; is defended by a fort called Charles. It has a market every Saturday, beginning at sunrise and finishing at midday, whither the Negroes bring maize, names, gardenherbs, fruits, &amp;c. In the parish of San Juan is a piece of sulphureous land, in the upper extremity of an opening of the land, called Solfatara, or Sulphur gut, which is so hot as to be felt through the soles of the shoes when being trodden upon. At the foot offhe declivity of this same part of the city, is a small hot stream, called the Bath, which being supposed to rise from the aforesaid spot, loses itself shortly in the sand. Towards the side lying next the sea are two fountains, one of hot water, the other of cold, and of these two are formed the lake of Blackrock, the waters of which are of a moderate warmth, and which lies to the n. of the city, being nearly a quarter of a mile's distance from the place where are caught eels and silverfish, resembling the cod and slimgut in flavour, the latter of which has a head disproportioned to its body. [A prodigious piece of Nevis mountain falling down in an earthquake several years ago, left a large vacuity, which is still to be seen. The altitude of this mountain, taken by a quadrant from Charlestown bay, is said to be a mile and a half perpendicular ; and from the said bay to the top, four miles. The declivity from this mountain to the town is very steep halfway, -but afterwards easy of ascent.] In Lat. 17° 8' n. and long. 62° 40' w. 
Charlestown, another city of the island of Barbadoes ; the situation of which is two leagues from that of San Miguel. It has a good port defended by two castles ; the one beyond the other, and both commanding the city and the road : in the middle of them is a platform. The inhabitants carry on a great trade with the other islands.

==[[Charleton|CHARLETON]]==, an island situate near the e. coast of the country of Labrador, in the part ofN. 3 b    370    America called New South Wales. Its territory consists of a white dry sand, and it is covered with small trees and shrubs. This island has a beautiful appearance in the spring to those who discover it after a voyage of three or four months, and after having seen nothing but a multitude of mountains covered with frost, which lie in the bay, and in the strait of Hudson, and which are rocks petrified with eternal ice. This island appears at that season as though it were one heap of verdure. The air at the bottom of the bay, although in 51° of lat. and nearer to the sun than London, is excessively cold for nine months, and extremely hot the remaining three, save when the n. w. wind prevails. The soil on the e. as well as on the w. side produces all kinds of grain and fruits of fine qualities, which are cultivated on the shore of the river Rupert. Lat. 52° 12' n. Long. 80° w.

It is watered by the river which rises in the pool or lake of Valladolid, and by which the crops of wheat, maize, lentils, and the fruits peculiar to the place, are rendered fertile and productive. This reduced jurisdiction belongs to the Marquises of Valle, and is subject to the Dukes of Terranova. Its population is reduced to «ome ranchos, or meetings for the purpose of labour, and to the capital, which has the same name, and which contains a convent of the religious order of St. Augustin, this being one of the first [temples built by the Spaniards in this kingdom, the present dilapidated state of it bearing ample testimony to its great antiquity. It contains 430 families of Pirindas Indians, employed in labour and in the cultivation of the land, and in making bread, which is carried for the supply of Valladolid, the neighbouring ranchos and estates.

[Chatjote re Falls are situate about nine miles above Quebec, on the opposite shore, and about three or four miles back from the river St. Lawrence, into which the river Chaudiere disembogues itself. The river is seen at a distance, emerging from a thick wood, and gradually expanding from an almost imperceptible stream till it reaches the cataract, whose breadth is upwards of 360 feet. Here the disordered masses of rock, which appear to have been rent from their bed by some violent convulsion of nature, break the course of the waters, and precipitate them from a height of 120 feet into an immense chasm below. In some parts large sheets of water roll over the precipice, and fall unbroken to the bottom ; while in other places the water dashes from one fragment of the rock to another, with wild impetuosity, bellowing and foaming with rage in every hollow and cavity that obstructs its progress ; from thence it rushes down with the rapidity of lightning into the boiling surge beneath, where it rages with inconceivable fury, till driven from the gulf by fresh columns, it hurries away and loses itself in the waters of the St. Lawrence. The scenery which accompanies the cataract of Chaudiere is beautiful and romantic beyond description. In the centre, a large fragment of rock, which. first divides the water, at the summit of the precipice, forms a small island ; and a handsome firtree, which grows upon it, is thus placed in a most singular and picturesque situation. The forest on either side the river consists of firs, pines, birch, oak, ash, and a variety of other trees and shrubs, intermingled in the most wild and romantic manner. Their dark green foliage, joined with the brown and sombre tint of the rocky fragments over which the water precipitates itself, form a striking and pleasing contrast to the snowy whiteness of the foaming surge, and the columns of sparkling spray which rise in clouds and mingle temperature is various, since it contains the settle with the air.]

Here are bred.    CHE cattle of all sorts ; and there are some gold mines, though they produce at present very sparingly; some of the silver mines, winch were very fruitful, have lately filled with water, and attempts have been made in vain to empty them. Indeed the only mine* which have produced any great wealth are those found in the mountains of Aullagas, and from them, for some years past, metals of the rarest qualities have been extracted. In the woods of the valleys, which produce very fine and excellent timber, are found wolves, tigers, and other wild beasts inhabiting the mountains ; also a species of bees, which form their combs in the hollows of trees, and the honey of which they call de charas.

==[[Chetimachas|CHETIMACHAS]]==, a river of the province and government of Louisiana. It is an arm of the Mississippi, which runs s. e. and enters the sea on the side of the bay of Asuncion or Ascension. [On the Chetimachas, six leagues from the Mississippi, there is a settlement of Indians of the same name ; and thus far it is uniformly 100 yards broad, and from two to four fathoms deep, when the water is lowest. Some drifted logs have formed a shoal at its mouth on the Mississippi ; but as the water is deep under them they could be easily removed ; and the Indians say there is nothing to impede navigation from their village to the gulf. The banks are more elevated than those of the Mississippi, and in some places are so high as never to be overflowed. The natural productions are the same as on the Mississippi, but the soil, from the extraordinary size and compactness of the canes, is superior. If measures were adopted and pursued with a view to improve this communication, there would soon be on its banks the most prosperous and important settlements in that colony.] [Chetimachas, Grand Lake of, in Louisiana, near the mouth of the Mississippi, is 24 miles long, and nine broad. Lake de Portage, which is 13 miles long, and If broad, communicates with this lake at the n. end, by a strait a quarter of a mile wide. The country bordering on these lakes is low and flat, timbered with cypress, live and other kinds of oak ; and on the e. side, the land between it and the Chafalaya river is divided by innumerable streams, which occasion as many islands. Some of these streams are navigable. A little distance from the s. e. shore of the lake Chetimachas, is an island where persons passing that way generally halt as a resting place. Nearly opposite this island there is an opening which leads to the sea. It is about 150 yards wide, and has 16 or 17 fathoms water.]

==[[Cheuelus|CHEUELUS]]==, orCiiAVELos, a barbarous nation of Indians of the country of Maranon, who inhabit the woods bordeiing upon the river Aguarico, to the e. and in the vicinity of the lakes. They are warlike, of a cruel and treacherous nature, and in eternal enmity with their neighbours. M. dc la Martiniere will have it, that the name Chavelos is derived from the French word chevcux, the men and the women both allowing and encouraging the growth of their hair till it reaches down to the waist ; supposing, forsooth, that these Indians must either have known French when they were discovered, or that their discoverers, at all events, must have been French. 
==[[Cheura|CHEURA]]==, a river of the province and government of Esmeraldas in the kingdom of Quito. It runs n. n. e. and e. washing the country of the ancient Esmeraldas Indians : it afterwards enters the river of its name on the e. side, in lat. 1° 23' n.

==[[Chiapa|CHIAPA]]==, a province and alcaldia mayor of the kingdom of Guatemala ; bounded on thew. by the province of Tabasco, e. by that of Vera Paz, w. by that of Oaxaca of Nueva Espafia, and s. e. by that of Soconusco. It extends 85 leagues from e. to mi and is nearly 30 across at its widest part. It was conquered by Captain Diego Marariegos in 1531 : is divided into districts or alcaldias mayores, which are those of Zoques, Chontales, Los Llanos, and Xiquipila: is of a warm and moist temperature, although it has some parts in which the cold predominates. Its woods abound with large trees of pine, cypress, cedar, and walnut ; and of others of a resinous kind, from which  are extracted aromatic gums, balsams, and liquid amber, tacamaca, copal, &amp;c. It produces also, in abundance, maize, swine, honey, cotton, cochineal, which is only made use of for the purpose of dyeing the cotton ; also cacao, and much pepper and achote, or the heartleaved bixa ; also various kinds of domestic and wild birds, especially parrots, which are very beautiful and highly esteemed ; a small bird, called toto, less than a young pigeon, with green wings ; this is caught by the Indians, who pluck from its tail some feathers, which they prize highly, and then restoring it to liberty; it being a capital offence, according to their laws, to destroy it. The sheep, goats, and pigs," which have been brought from Europe, have multiplied in this province in a most extraordinary manner ; so also have horses, which are of such an esteemed breed, that the colts are taken from hence to Mexico, a distance of 500 miles. In the woods breed many lions, leopards, tigers, and wild boars, a great number of snakes, some being 20 feet in length, and others of a beautiful crimson colour, streaked with black and white. The territory is, for the most part, rugged and mountainous, and watered by different rivers : none of these, however, are of any particular consideration, although that which bears the name of this province is the medium by which the aforesaid productions are carried to the other provinces ; and although this province may be accounted comparatively poor, from being without mines of gold or silver, it is nevertheless of the greatest importance, as being the outwork or barrier to New Spain, from the facility with which this kingdom might be entered by the river Tabasco. The capital is the royal city of Chiapa, situate on a delightful plain. It is the head of a bishopric, erected in 1538; and has for arms a shield, upon which arc two sierras, with a river passing between them : above the one is a golden castle, with a lion rampant upon it ; and above the other a green palm,bearing fruit, and another lion, the whole being upon a red field. These arms were granted by the Emperor Charles V. in 1535. The cathedral is very beautiful. It contains three convents of the order of St. Francis, La Merced, and St. Domingo ; a monastery of nuns, and five hermitages. Its population is scanty and poor, and the principal commerce consists in cocoanuts, cotton, wool, sugar, cochineal, and other articles. Its nobility, although poor, are very proud, as having descended from some ancient families of the first nobility of Spain; such as those of Mendoza, Velasco, Cortes, &amp;c.

Lat Chiapa, another city in the same province, which, to distinguish it from the former, is called Chiapa de los Indios; these (the Indians) being, for the most part, its inhabitants ; is the largest settlement in the whole province, and is situate in a valley close upon the river Tabasco, being 12 leagues distant from the former city. It has various churches, abounds in wealth, and is the place wherein the Indian families first settled. They enjoy many privileges and exemptions, owing to the zeal of the bishop, Fray Bartolome de las Casas, their procurator at court. The river abounds greatly in fine fish ; and is full of barks, with which they occasionally represent seafights. In the city also there are commonly balls, plays, concerts, bullfights, and spectacles of horsemanship ; since the inhabitants are much given to diversions, and in these grudge no expence.

Chiautla, with the addition of La Sal, another settlement, the capital of its jurisdiction, in the same kingdom, thus called from the salt mines found in it formerly, and from which the inhabitants used to derive a great commerce. At present it is in a thorough state of decay, not only as its trade has fallen off in the other provinces ; but as the Indians have applied themselves rather to the cultivation of the soil and the planting of fruits and pulse, from the traffic of which they derive their maintenance. It is inhabited by 650 families of Mexican Indians, and 40 of Spaniards, Mus~ tees, and Mulattoes. It contains a convent of the religious order of St. Augustin. The jurisdiction is so much reduced that it is not more than five leagues in length and three in width, void of commerce, and has but a small revenue. Its inhabitants, although they are somewhat given to the breeding of small cattle, yet this must' hardly be considered with them a branch of commerce, since they have scarcely enough of these wherewith to support themselves.

==[[Chicama|CHICAMA]]==, a large, fertile, and beautiful valley of the province and corregimiento of Truxillo in Peru. It was one of the most populous in the times of the gentilism of the Indians, owing to its agreeable and benign temperature : is watered by a river of its name, which divides it from that of Chimu. In 1540, the friar Domingo de Santo Tomas founded here a#convent of his order, for the instruction of the Indians, which immediately was turned into a priory and a house for noviciates.

It is afterwards called Chicamocha, and passes through various provinces, until it becomes incorporated with the Magdalena, into which it enters in one large mouth. A little before this it forms a good port, called De la Tora, where there was formerly a settlement, but which is at present in a state of utter ruin.

CHICHAS y Tarija, a province and corregimiento of Peru; bounded on the n. by that of Cintij s, by that of Tucuman, the river called  
Quiaca serving as the line of division, w. by that of Lipes, and n. by that of Porco. The district of Tarija belonging to this corregimiento, which is 40 leagues distant from the capital of Chichas, is bounded e. by the territories of the infidel Chiriguanos, Chanaes, and Mataguayos Indians, to the first settlements of which from the last habitations of Tarija there is a narrow, craggy, and mountainous route of 14 leagues in length. It is also bounded on the n. and w. by the valley of Pilaya, and on the s. by the jurisdiction of Xuxui. The district of Chichas is 140 leagues in circumference, and that of Tarija 80, being either of them intersected by some extensive serranias : in the boundaries of the former there are many farms and estates for breeding cattle, where are also produced potatoes, maize, wheat, barley and other grain, likewise some wine. Here are mines of gold and silver, which were formerly very rich ; it having been usual for the principal ones to yield some thousand marks in each caxon ; this being especially the case in the mines of Nueva Chocaya, which still yield to this day 50 or 60 marks. Many of the metals found in these mines are worked up for useful purposes. The mines of Chilocoa have, on the whole, been most celebrated for their riches. The rivers, which are of some note, are that of Supacha, which flows down from the cordillera of Lipes, and running e. passes through the middle of the province until it enters the valley of Cinti, of the province of Pilaya and Paspaya ; and another, called Toropalca, which enters the province of Porco, and passes on to the same part of Cinti. The inhabitants of this district amount to 6200. In the settlement of Tatasi both men and women are subject to a distressing lunacy, which causes them to run wildly and heedlessly over the mountains, without any regard to the precipices which lie in their way ; since it has generally been observed that they dash themselves headlong down : if, however, it should happen that they are not killed, the fall, they say, frequently restores them to a sane mind. The observation, that the animals of this country, namely, the vicunas and the native sheep, are subject to this malady, is without foundation ; but it is thought to arise from the peculiar effluviasof the minerals abounding here, and which have a great tendency to cause convulsions. The women of the aforesaid settlement, when about to bring forth children, like to be delivered of them in the low parts of the quebradas, or deep glens. The settlements of this province are,

The district of Tarija is a territory full of quebradas and craggy mountains, as far as the punas and lofty plains of Escayache and Tacsora, where there are two salt lakes. It is composed of four fertile valleys lying on the skirts of hills, and in these are found human bones of a prodigious size, petrified, shinbones of a yard and a quarter long, and teeth larger than a fist. In the midst of one of these valleys is the town of San Bernardo de Tarija, which is the capital of the province. Its repartimiento used to amount to 82,350 dollars, and its alcavala to 558 dollars per annum. For the settlements of this district, see above.

Its jurisdiction includes some of the finest and richest provinces. It, consists of five head settlements of districts, to which are subject as many other. Its capital contains 430 families of Indians, and some of Spaniards, Mustees, and Mulattoes. Ninety leagues s. e. of Mexico.

CH1LCA, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Canete in Peru, with a small but safe and convenient port.

==[[Chilchoiaque|CHILCHOIAQUE]]==, a settlement of the head settlement of Tlacolula, and alcaldia mayor of Xalapa, in Nueva Espaila ; situate in a very extensive glen, surrounded by heights which begin in the neighbourhood of Xilotepec, and run somewhat more than a league in length. The population is very scanty, and the temperature bad ; indeed, out of the many families which formerly inhabited it, 19 only are remaining ; these employ themselves in the rancherias, agriculture being indispensably necessary to their maintenance, owing to the barrenness of the territory of the district. At the distance of a league to the n. of Xalapa, and on the side of the royal road leading to Mexico, is the great mill of Lucas Martin. Here the lands are fertilized by the large river Cerdeno ; by the waters of which also other settlements are supplied, as likewise some of the ranchos, wherein employment is found for upwards of SO families of Spaniards, some Mustees, and many Indians. Four leagues to the s. w. of its head settlement. 
==[[Chilchota|CHILCHOTA]]==, the alcaldia mayor and jurisdiction of the province and bishopric of Mechoacan.

Its population consists of 470 families of Tarascos Indians, and about 300 of Spaniards, Mulattoes, and Mustees', who are, for the most part, scattered in the agricultural estates of its district, where, from the fertility of the soil, wheat, maize, and other seeds, are cultivated in abundance. The country is agreeable, and well stocked with every kind of fruit trees. The capu  CHI  tal, the settlement of this name, is 70 leagues to the w. n. w. of Mexico.

It is of an extremely cold and moist temperature, and its commerce depends upon the working of the lead mines. Some silver mines were formerly worked here, but these yielded so base a metal, and in such small quantities, that they were entirely abandoned for those of lead, which yielded by far the greatest emolument. Five leagues to the e. of its capital. 

==[[Chile|CHILE]]==, a kingdom in the most s. part of S. America, bounded on the n. by Peru, on the s. by the straits of Magellan and Terra del Fuego, on the e. by the provinces of Tucuman and Buenos Ayres, on the n. e. by Brazil and Paraguay, and on the w. by the S. sea. It extends from n. to s. 472 leagues; comprehending the Terras Magallanicas from the straits and the plains or deserts of Copiapo, which are its most n. parts. The Inca Yupanqui, eleventh Emperor of Peru, carried his conquests as far as the river Maidi or Maulle, in lat. 34° 30' s. Diegro de Almagro was the first Spaniard who discovered this country, in the year 1535, and began its conquest, which was afterwards followed up, in 1541, by the celebrated Pedro de Valdivia, who founded its first cities, and afterwards met with a disgraceful death at the hands of the Indians, having been made prisoner by them in the year 1551. These Indians are the most valorous and warlike of all in America ; they have maintained, by a continual warfare, their independence of the Spaniards, from whom they are separated by the river Biobio. This is the limit of the country possessed by them ; and though the Spaniards have penetrated through different entrances into their territories, and there built various towns and fortresses, yet have all these been pulled down and destroyed by those valiant de-   fenders of their liberty and their country. They are most dexterous in the management of the lance, sword, arrow, and weapons made of Macana wood ; and although they are equally so in the practice of firearms, they use them but seldom, saying, " they are only fit for cowards." They are very agile and dexterous horsemen, and their horses are excellent, since those which run wild, and which are of the Andalucian breed, have not degenerated, or become at all inferior to the best which that country produces. The part which the Spaniards possess in this kingdom extends its whole length, from the aforesaid valley of Copiapo to the river Sinfordo, (unfathomable), beyond the isle of Chiloe, in lat. 44°, but it is only 45 leagues, at the most, in breadth ; so that the country is, as it were, a slip between the S. sea and the cordillera of the Andes : from these descend infinite streams and rivers, watering many fertile and beautiful valleys, and forming a country altogether charming and luxurious; the soil abounds in every necessary for the convenience and enjoyment of life, producing, in regular season, all the most delicate fruits of America and Europe. The summer here begins in September, the estio (or hot summer) in December, the autumn in March, and the winter in June. The climate is similar to that of Spain, and the temperature varies according to the elevation of the land; since the provinces lying next to Peru, and which are very low, are of a warm temperature, and lack rain, having no other moisture than what they derive from some small rivers descending from the cordillera, and running, for the space of 20 or 30 leagues, into the sea. In the other provinces it rains more frequently, in proportion as they lay more to the s. especially in the winter, from April to September ; for which reason they are more fertile. These provinces are watered by more than 40 rivers, which also descend from the cordillera, being formed by the rains, and the snow melted in the summer, swelling them to a great height. They generally abound in fish of the most delicate flavour, of which are eels, trout, bagres, reyeques, ahogatos, pejereyes, and many others. The seacoast is of itself capable of maintaining a vast population by the shellfish found upon it, of twenty different sorts, and all of the most delicious flavour. Other fish also is not wanting ; here are plenty of skate, congers, robalos, sienas f a species of trout, viejas, soles, machuelos, dorados, pejega/los, pulpos, pampanos, corbinas, pejereyes, and tunnies, which come at their seasons on the coast, in the same manner as in the Almadrabas of Andalucia. For some years past they salt down codfish in these parts, which, although of a   CHILE.  smaller size, are more delicate, and of superior flavour to those caught in Newfoundland. Ambergris is also found upon the coast. The mountains abound in trees of the most beautiful kind, laurels, oaks of four sorts, the carobtree, the wood of which is extremely hard, reulis, cinnamontrees, Cyprus, sandal, paraguas, hazelnut, wallnut, volos, and alerces, which are a kind of cedar, of which they make planks in great numbers to carry to Lima and other parts. Many of these trees are green the whole year round, from the moisture and shelter they derive from the Cordillera, which contains in its bowels much fire, as appears from the volcanoes found upon it, and which are 12 in number, without counting many others, even as far as the straits of Magellan. Although these mountains and woods are so immense, beasts of a savage kind are rarely to be found, excepting such, now and then, as a tiger or leopard ; but there are great numbers of deer, stags, vicunas, and huanacos, which served as food for the Indians ; as likewise of birds, as ducks, vandurrias, swans, herons, kites, doves, piuguenes, tartales, parrots, hawks, falcons, goshawks; and many singing birds, as goldfinches, larks, starlings, diucas, frillies, and many others. Its present vegetable productions are wheat, barley, Indian wheat, grains of different kinds, oil of the finest olives, excellent wines, much esteemed in Peru ; all kinds of succulent fruits, oranges, lemons, innumerable sorts of apples, and every kind of garden herb. Flax and hemp is cultivated here, from which they make rigging for vessels trading to the S. seas ; and this could be supplied in a proportion equal to any demand. This kingdom keeps up a considerable trade with Peru ; for, one year with the other, it sends to Lima from 150 to 180,000 bushels of wheat, 120,006 quintals of grease, much wine, and other productions, as almonds, nuts, lentils, a sort of wild marjoram and bastard saffron ; and takes in exchange sugar and cloths of the country. It derives also great emolument from large herds of the cow kind, from flocks of sheep and goats, of the skins of which they procure fine tanned leather, leathern jackets, shamois leather, and soles of shoes : from these animals is also procured much fat or tallow. Here are numerous breeds of most beautiful horses, and some of these, from excelling all the others in the swiftness of their paces, are called aguiUUias. It also abounds in mules, and it would still more so, if, as formerly, tbey were in request at Peru, where their skins were used instead of fine cloths and carpets. Baizes are still  made  as likewise some sorts of small cord, coarse  stuffs, and many kinds of sackcloth, which is the  common vesture, and consists of a square garment, with an opening to admit the head ; but many looms have been lost through a w r ant of Indians in the manufactories. The greater part of these people still prefer their original uncivilized state, depending upon the natural fruits of the earth for for their food ; for, besides the productions above enumerated, they used to gather, without the trouble of cultivation, all sorts of delicious fruits, such as pines, though different from those of Europe; and to make excellent chicha of the murtilla. Indeed the luxuriance and abundance of delicate flowers, and aromatic and medicinal herbs, is almost incredible ; of the last the following are the most esteemed for their virtue, viz. the canchalagua, quinchemali, albahaquilla, and culen. It contains many mines of the richest gold, silver, copper, lead, tin, quicksilver, brimstone, loadstone, and coal : yielding immense riches, which the Indians never appreciated, nor even gave themselves the least trouble about, until the conquest of the Incas, who began to work them ; sending portions of gold to Cuzco for the ornament of the temples and palaces, rather by way of gift than of tribute. The incursions and rebellions of the Indians, principally of the Araucanians, who, in the year 1599, took and destroyed six cities, viz. Valdivia, Imperial, Angol, Santa Crux, Chilian, and Concepcion, is the cause why the population is in many places not large, and that it consists of poor people, living in small communities ; the fact being, that they are always living in constant dread of a surprise from the Indians; not but that on the confines there are garrisons, well defended by Spanish troops, with necessary provisions of artillery, victuals, and ammunition. The war which has from the beginning been sustained by the Spaniards against these most ferocious Indians, has tended greatly to reduce the numbers of the former ; some having been killed on the spot, and others doomed to be slaves to their indignant conquerors. Indeed, when it was found that arms were of no avail against them, some missionaries of the society of the Jesuits were sent among them, in the year 1612, in order to propagate the gospel ; when the Fathers Horacio Vechi and Martin de Aranda suffered martyrdom at their hands: after which a treaty of peace was made by the Governor Marquis de Baides, A. D. 1640, and which has since been renewed yearly ; their deputies coming regularly to the capital to receive the presents from the king of Spain. They have, notwithstanding, at different times broken the treaty, making incursions into the Spanish towns, and their manner 4 m  CHILE.  of declaring war is by sending from town to town an arrow clenched in a dead man's hand, which they call convocatoria ; and this they did in the year 1723, making terrible havoc and slaughter. This kingdom is evidently, from what has been asserted, the most fertile, abundant, rich, and delightful region of all America ; to which Nature has granted, in profusion, all that she has given to others, either with a sparing hand, or at too high a price. The people are healthy and robust. The wind which generally prevails is thes. w. and the Puelche, which comes from the Cordillera, is somewhat troublesome. [The Puelche wind takes its name from some Indians so called, and from whose country it blows.] Chile is divided into two bishoprics, suffragan to the archbishopric of Lima ; and these are of Santiago and La Concepcion. It is governed by a president, governor, and captaingeneral, which title was first possessed by Don Melchor Bravo de Saravia, and its government is divided into 18 provinces or districts, which are,

Chap. I. Origin and language of the Chilians.— Conquest of the Peruvians, and state of Chile before the arrival of the Spaniards.— What was then its political establishments, government, and arts. Of the origin and language of tlie Chilians, no traces are to be found further back than the middle of the 15th century, which was the time when the Peruvians first began their conquests in this delightful country. It is the general opinion that America was settled from the n. e. part of Asia, but the opinion entertained by the Chilians is. that] 3e 2  C H I L E&gt;  
[their country was peopled from the w. However this may be, that it was originally peopled by one nation appears possible, as" all the Aborigines inhabiting it, however independent of each other, speak the same language, and have a similar appearance. 
I. Language. — Their language is copious, full of harmony and richness. Each verb, either derivatively or conjunctively, becomes the root of numerous other verbs and nouns, as well adjectives as substantives, which in their turn reproduce others, which are secondary, modifying themselves in an hundred different ways. There is no part of speech from which an appropriate verb cannot be formed by the addition of a final en. Even from the most simple particles various verbs are derived, that give great precision and strength to conversation : but what is truly surprising in this language is, that it contains no irregular verb or noun. Every thing in it may be said to be regulated with a geometrical precision, and displays much art with great simplicity : it contains words, apparently of Greek and Latin derivation, and of a similar signification in both languages. But what is most remarkable, it differs from every other American language, not less in its words than in its construction ; and with all its richness and harmony, its theory is so easy that it may be readily learned in a few days. Several grammars of this language are to be met with, but that of Febres, printed at Lima in 1765, is particularly to be recommended for its method and clearness. One argument further in favour of the simplicity of this tongue, is the circumstance of its having maintained itself in its pure state, and of its not having sunk into an unintelligible unconnected jargon, when it is considered that the Chilians, to the aforementioned period, had no ideas of writing, and that their traditionary accounts were so crude and imperfect, as to afford not the least degree of information to the inquisitive mind. Hence it follows that the first accounts of them are contained in the Peruvian annals ; that nation, as it was more civilized, being more careful to preserve the memory of remarkable events. 
2. Original state. — When the Inca Yupanqui began to attempt the conquest of Chile, its inhabitants were supposed to be numerous. They were divided into 15 tribes or communities, independent of each other, but subject to certain chiefs called ulmmes. These tribes, beginning at the n. and proceeding to the 5. were called Copiapins, Coquimbanes, Quillotanes, Mapochinians, Promaucians, Cures, Cauques, Penconcs, Araucanians, Cunches, Chilotes, Chiquilanians, Pchuenches, Pu-  elches, and Huilliches. Of these were subjugated to the Peruvian government, more by persuasion than force, the Copiapins, Coquimbanes, Quillotanes, and Mapochinians ; but the valour of the Promaucians put a stop to the success of the arms of the Inca, or rather to Sinchiruca, (a prince of the blood royal), to whom was entrusted the command of the expedition : for these brave people, naturally addicted to pleasures and diversions, and whose very name signifies the free dancers, opposed the Peruvian army with the most heroic valour, and entirely defeated it in a battle which, according to Carcilasso the historian, was continued for three days in succession. 
3. Divided into free and subjugated. — Thus Chile became divided into two parts, the one free, and the other subject to foreign domination. The tribes who had so readily submitted to the Peruvians were subjected to an annual tribute in gold, an imposition which they had never before experienced ; but the conquerors, whether they dared not hazard the attempt, or were not able to effect it, never introduced their form of government into these provinces. Of course, the subjected Chilians, as well as the free, preserved until the arrival of the Spaniards their original manners, which were by no means so rude as many are led to imagine. 
4. Agriculture. — Agriculture was already known to them ; but being in want of animals to till the ground, they were accustomed to turn it up with a spade made of hard wood. The plants which either necessity or accident made known to them, were the maize, the magu, the guegen, the tuca, the quinoa, pulse of various kinds, the potato, the oxalis tuberos/a, the common and the yellow pumpkin or gourd, the Guinea pepper, the madi, and the great strawberry. To these provisions of the vegetable kind, may be added the following of the animal, the little rabbit, and the Chiliheuque or Araucanian camel, whose flesh furnished excellent food, and whose wool, clothing for these people. If tradition may be credited, they had also the hog and the domestic fowl. With these productions, which required a very moderate degree of industry, they subsisted comfortably, and even with a degree of abundance, considering the few things which their situation rendered necessary. Subsistence, the source of population, being thus secured, the country became rapidly peopled under the influence of so mild a climate; whence it appears, that the first writers who treated of Chile, cannot have greatly exaggerated in saying, that the Spaniard's found it filled with inhabitants. 
5. Civilized stale. — It is a fact that there was but one language spoken throughout the country ; a]   

CHILE.  [proof that these tribes were in the habit of intercourse with each other, and were not insulated, or separated by vast deserts, or by immense lakes or forests, which is the case in many other parts of America. Another proof of their civilization, and perhaps equally so, as to the amount of population, is, that they had in many parts of the country aqueducts for watering their fields, which were constructed with much skill. Among these, the canal which for the space of many miles borders the rough skirts of the mountains in the vicinity of the capital, and waters the land to the n. of that city, is particularly remarkable for its extent and solidity. The right of property was fully established among the Chilians ; they were found to have collected themselves in societies, more or less numerous, in those districts that were best suited to their occupation ; and here, having established themselves in large villages, called cara, a name which they at present give to the Spanish cities, or in small ones, which they denominated lov, they enjoyed a specific form of government, and they had in each village or hamlet a chief, called ulmen, signifying a rich man, who in certain points was subject to the supreme ruler of the tribe, who was known by the same name. They built their houses of a quadrangular form, and covered the roof with rushes ; the walls were made of wood plastered with clay, and sometimes of brick, called by them tica. A house of similar construction at the village of Casa Blancn, is mentioned by Vancouver as having afforded accommodation to himself and friends on their way to St. J ago : indeed, they are still the common dwellings of the Indians ; and some of the villages before mentioned exist at present in several parts of Spanish Chile ; and of these the most considerable are Lampa, in the province of St. Jago, and Lora, in that of Maiile. They manufactured cloths for their garments from the wool of the Cbilihueque: they used two kinds of looms ; the first not unlike that used in Europe, the other vertical. It is very certain that the art of pottery is very ancient in Chile, as on opening a large heap of stones in the mountains of Arauco, an urn of extraordinary size Avas discovered at the bottom. 
6. The metals. — The mines of gold, silver, and other metals, with which this country abounds, had not yet been fully appreciated ; but they extracted from the earth gold, silver, copper, tin, and lead, and after purifying, employed ' these metals in a variety of useful and curious works. They had also discovered the method of making salt upon the seashore, and extracted fossil salt from several mountains which abounded in that  production. They procured dyes of all colours for their cloths, not only from the juice of plants, but also from mineral earths, and had discovered the art of fixing them by means of the polcura, a luminous stone of an astringent quality. Instead of soap, the composition of which they had not discovered, although acquainted with lye, they employed the bark of the quillai, which is an excellent substitute. From the seeds of the madi they obtained an oil, which is very good to eat and to burn, though it is not ascertained whether they ever applied it to the latter purpose. Although hunting was not a principal occupation with these people, they were accustomed to take such wild animals as are found in their country, particularly birds, of which there are great quantities. It is alleged, that from their connection with the Peruvians, they had advanced so far with respect to the enlargement of the sphere of their ideas, as to invent words capable of expressing any number ; mart signifying with them 10, pataca 100, and quaranca 1000. 
7. Substitute for writing. — To preserve the memory of their transactions, they made use, as other nations have done, of the pron, called by the Peruvians quippo, which was a skein of thread of several colours, with a number of knots: the subject treated of was indicated by the colours, and the knots designated the number or quantity. The progress which they had made in physic and astronomy was indeed wonderful ; but an account of these, of their religion, their music, and military skill, is deferred until we treat of the Araucanians, who still continue the faithful depositories of all the science and ancient customs of the Chilians. (See subsequent chapter III.) 
Chap. II. First expeditions of the Spaniards in Chile; encounters with the natives, with various success, until the alliance formed between the Spaniards and the Promaucians. 
1. Almagro marches against Chile.— Francis Pizarro and Diego Almagro having put to death the Inca Atahualpa, had subjected the empire of Peru to the dominion of Spain. Pizarro, desirous of enjoying without a rival this important conquest, made at their mutual espence, persuaded his companion to undertake the reduction of Chile, celebrated for its riches throughout all those countries, Almagro, filled with sanguine expectations of booty, began his march for that territory in the end of the year 1535, with an army composed of 570 Spaniards and 15,000 Peruvians, under the command of Paullu, the brother of the Inca Manco, the]  CHILE.  
[nominal emperor of Peru, who had succeeded the unfortunate Atahualpa. 
2. Roads from Peru to Chile. — Two roads lead from Peru to Chile ; one is by the seacoast, and is destitute of water and provision ; the other, for a distance of 120 miles, passes over the immense mountains of the Andes : the inexperience of Almagro caused him to take the latter ; for although it was, without doubt, the shortest, it was difficult in the extreme : for his army, after having been exposed to infinite fatigue, and many conflicts with the adjoining savages, reached the Cordilleras just at the commencement of winter, destitute of provisions, and but ill supplied with clothing. In this season the snow falls almost incessantly, and completely covers the few paths that are passable in summer; notwithstanding, the soldiers, encouraged by their general, advanced with much toil to the -top of those rugged heights. But, victims to the severity of the weather, 150 Spaniards there perished, with 10,000 Peruvians, who, being accustomed to the warmth of the torrid zone, were less able to endure the rigours of the frost. It is affirmed, that of all this army not one would have escaped with life, had not Almagro, resolutely pushing forward with a few horse, sent them timely succours and provisions, which were found in abundance at Copiapo. 
3. Kindly received at Copiapo. — Those of the most robust constitutions, who were able to resist the inclemency of the season, by this unexpected aid, were enabled to extricate themselves from the snow, and at length reached the plains of that province, which is the first in Chile ; where, through respect for the Peruvians, they were well received and entertained by the inhabitants. While Almagro remained in Copiapo, he discovered that the reigning ulmen had usurped the government in prejudice of his nephew and ward, who, through fear of his uncle, had fled to the woods. Pretending to be irritated at this act of injustice, he caused the guilty chief to be arrested, and calling before him the lawful heir, reinstated him in the government, with the universal applause of his subjects, who attributed this conduct entirely to motives of justice, and a wish to redress the injured. The Spaniards, having recovered from their fatigues through the hospitable assistance of the Copiapins, and reinforced by a number of recruits whom Rodrigo Organez had brought from Peru, commenced their march for the s. provinces. As it was natural, the natives were not a little curious concerning these their new visitors : they crowded around them to their march, as well to examine them near, as a present them with such things as they thought  would prove agreeable to a people who appeared to them of a character far superior to that of other men. In the mean time, two soldiers having separated from the army, proceeded to Guasco, where they were at first well received, but were afterwards put to death by the inhabitants, in consequence, no doubt, of some acts of violence, which soldiers freed from the controul of their officers are very apt to commit. 
4. First European blood shed. — This was the first European blood spilt in Chile, a country afterwards so copiously deluged with it. On being informed of this unfortunate accident, calculated to destroy the exalted opinion which he wished to inspire of his soldiers, Almagro, having proceeded to Coquimbo, ordered the ulmen of the district, called Marcando, his brother, and twenty of the principal inhabitants, to be brought thither; all of whom, together with the usurper of Copiapo, he delivered to the flames, without, according to Herrera, pretending to assign any reason for his conduct. This act of cruelty appeared to every one very extraordinary and unjust, since among those adventurers there were not wanting men of sensibility, and advocates for the rights of humanity. The greater part of the army openly disapproved of the severity of their general, the aspect of whose affairs, from this time forward, became gradually worse and worse. About this period, 1537, Almagro received a considerable reinforcement of recruits under Juan de Rada, accompanied with royal letters patent, appointing him governor of 200 leagues of territory, situate to the s. of the government granted to Francis Pizarro. The friends whom he had left in Peru, taking advantage of this opportunity, urged him by private letters to return, in order to take possession of Cuzco, which they assured him was within the limits of his jurisdiction. Notwithstanding this, inflated with his new conquest, he pursued his march, passed the fatal Cachapoal, and regardless of the remonstrances of the Peruvians, advanced into the country of the Promaucians. 
5. Battle with the Promaucians. — At the first sight of the Spaniards, their horses, and the thundering arms of Europe, these valiant people were almost petrified with astonishment ; but soon recovering from the effects of surprise, they opposed with intepridity their new enemies upon the shore of the Rio Claro. Almagro, despising their force, placed in the first line his Peruvian auxiliaries, increased by a number whom Paullu had drawn from the garrisons ; but these, being soon routed, fell back in confusion upon the rear. The Spaniards, who expected to have been merely specta-J    mi  

CHILE.  [tors of the battle, saw themselves compelled to sustain the vigorous attack of the enemy, and advancing with their horse, began a furious battle, which continued with great loss upon either side till night separated the combatants. Although the Promaucians had been very roughly handled, they lost not courage, but encamped in the sight of their enemy, determined to renew the attack the next morning. The Spaniards, however, though by the custom of Europe they considered themselves as victors, having kept possession of the field, were very differently inclined. Having been accustomed to subdue immense provinces with little or no resistance, they became disgusted with an enterprise which could not be eifected without great fatigue, and the loss of much blood, since in its prosecution they must contend with a bold and independent nation, by whom they were not believed to be immortal. 
6. Expedition abandoned, and why. — Thus all, by common consent, resolved to abandon this expedition ; but they were of various opinions respecting their retreat, some being desirous of returning to Peru, while others wished to form a settlement in the n. provinces, where they had been received with such hospitality. The first opinion was supported by Almagro, whose mind began to be impressed by the suggestions contained in the letters of his friends. Accordingly we find him returning with his army to Peru in 1538 : he took possession of the ancient capital of that empire ; and after several ineffectual negociations, fought a battle with the brother of Pizarro, by whom he was taken, tried, and beheaded as a disturber of the public peace. His army having dispersed at their defeat, afterwards reassembled under the title of the soldiers of Chile, and executed new disturbances in Peru, already sufficiently agitated. Such was the fate of the first expedition against Chile, undertaken by the best body of European troops that had as.yet been collected in those parts. The thirst of riches was the moving spring of the expedition, and the disappointment of their hopes of obtaining them, the cause of its failure. Francis the confines of Peru, is one of the most fertile and  to the Archipelago of Chiioe. Pizarro, jealous of these men, under frivolous pretexts, refused to confirm the royal nomination, and appointed to this expedition his quartermaster, Pedro de Valdivia, a prudent and active officer, who had gained experience in the Italian war, and what was still a greater recommendation, was attached to his party; directing him to take De II oz with him, who was probably more (o be feared than his colleague, and to allow him every advantage in the partition of the lands. 
7. Valdivia marches against Chile. — This officer having determined to establish a permanent settlement in the country, set out on his march in the year 1540, with 200 Spaniards, and a numerous body of Peruvian auxiliaries, accompanied by some monks, several women, and a great number of European quadrupeds, with every thing requisite for a new colony. He pursued the same route as Almagro; but, instructed by the misfortunes of his predecessor, he did not attempt to pass the Andes until midsummer. He entered Chile without incurring any loss, but very different was the reception he experienced from the inhabitants of the n. provinces from that which Almago had met with. Those people, informed of the fate of Peru, and freed from the submission they professed to owe the Inca, did not consider themselves obliged to respect their invaders. They of course began to attack them upon all sides, with more valour than conduct. Like barbarians in general, incapable of making a common cause with each other, and for a long time accustomed to the yoke of servitude, they attacked them by hordes or tribes, as they advanced, without that steady firmness which .characterises the valour of a civilized people. The Spaniards, however, notwithstanding the illcombined opposition of the natives, traversed the provinces of Copiapo, Coquimbo, Quillota, and Melipilla, and arrived, much harrassed, but with little loss, at that of Mapocho, now called St. Jago. 
8. Province of St. Jago described. — This province, which is more than 600 miles distance from  
Pizarro, having by the death of his rival obtained the absolute command of the Spanish possessions in S. America, lost not sight of the conquest of Chile, which he conceived might, in any event, prove an important acquisition to him. Among the adventurers who had come to Peru, were two officers commissioned by the court of Spain, under the titles of Governors, to attempt this expedition. To the first, called Pedro Sanchez de Hoz, was committed the conquest of the country as far as the river Maule ; and to the other, Carmargo,the remainder  pleasant in the kingdom. Its name signifies "the land of many people;" and from the accounts of the first writers upon Chile, its population corresponded therewith, being extremely numerous. It lies upon the confines of the principal mountain of the Andes, and is 140 miles in circumference. It is watered by the rivers Maypo, Colina, Lampa, and Mapocho, Avhich last divides it into two nearly equal parts ; and after pursuing a subterraneous course for the space of five miles, again shows itself with increased copiousness, and discharges its]  
■  CHILE.    [waters into the Maypo. The mountains of Caren, which terminate it on the n. abound with veins of gold ; and in that part of the Andes which bounds it at .the e. are found several rich mines of silver. Valdivia, who had endeavoured to penetrate as far as possible into the country, in order to render it difficult for his soldiers to return to Peru, determined to make a settlement in this province, which, "from its natural advantages, and its remoteness, appeared to him more suitable than any other for the centre of his conquests. 
9. Capital founded.— With, this view, having selected a convenient situation on the left shore of the Mapocho, on the 24th February 1541, he laid the foundations of the capital of the kingdom, to which, in honour of that apostle, he gave the name of St. Jago. In laying out the city, he divided the ground into plats or squares, each containing 4096 toises, a fourth of which he allowed to every citizen, a plan which has been pursued in the foundation of all the other cities ; one of these plats, lying upon the great square, he destined for the cathedral and the bishop's palace, which he intended to build there, and the one opposite for that of the government. He likewise appointed a magistracy, according to the forms of Spain, from such of his army as were the best qualified ; and to protect the settlement in case of an attack, he constructed a fort upon a hill in the centre of the city, which has since received the name of St. Lucia. Many have applauded the discernment of Valdivia, in having made choice of this situation for the seat of the capital of the colony. But considering the wants of a great city, it would have been better placed 15 miles farther to the s. upon the Maypo, a large river, which has a direct communication with the sea, and might easily be rendered navigable for ships of the largest size. This city, however, contained in 1807 more than 40,000 inhabitants, and is rapidly increasing in population, from its being the seat of government, and from its great commerce, supported by the luxury of the wealthy inhabitants. Meanwhile the natives saw with a jealous eye this new establishment, and concerted measures, although late, for freeing themselves of these unwelcome intruders. Valdivia having discovered their intentions in season, confined the chiefs of the conspiracy in the fortress ; and suspecting some secret intelligence between them and the neighbouring Promaucians, repaired with 60 horse to the river Cachapoal to watch their movements. But this measure was unnecessary ; that fearless people had not the policy to think of uniting with J heir neighbours in order to secure themselves from the impending danger.  
10. Steady unanimity of the Mapochinians. — The Mapochinians, taking advantage of the departure of the general, fell upon the colony with inconceivable fury, burned the halfbuilt houses, and assailed the citadel, wherein the inhabitants had taken refuge, on all sides. Notwithstanding; the ultimate defeat which the Mapochinians experienced in this battle, and others of not less importance which they afterwards experienced, they never ceased, for the space of six years, until their utter ruin, to keep the Spaniards closely besieged, attacking them upon every occasion that offered, and cutting off their provisions, in such a manner that they were compelled to subsist upon unwholesome and loathsome viands, and upon the little grain that they could raise beneath the cannon of the place. The fertile plains of the neighbourhood had become desert and uncultivated, as the inhabitants had destroyed their crops and retired to the mountains. This mode of life did not fail to disgust the soldiers of Valdivia, but he contrived wilh much prudence and address to sooth their turbulent spirits, painting to them in seducing colours the happy prospect that awaited them. 
11. The mine of Quilkta.—Va\divia had often heard in Peru thatthevalley of Quillota abounded in mines of gold, and imagined that he might obtain from thence a sufficient quantity to satisfy his soldiers ; in consequence, notwithstanding the difficulties with which he was surrounded, he sent thither a detachment of troops, with orders to superintend the digging of this precious metal. The mine that was "opened was so rich that its product surpassed their most sanguine hopes ; their present and past sufferings were all buried in oblivion, nor was there one among them who had the remotest wish of quitting the country. The governor, (for Valdivia had persuaded the magistracy of the city to give him this title), who was naturally enterprising, encouraged by this success, had a frigate built in the mouth of the river Chile, which traverses the valley, in order more readily to obtain succours from Peru, without which he was fully sensible he could not succeed in accomplishing his vast undertakings. In the mean time, as the state of affairs was urgent, Valdivia was resolved to send to Peru by land two of his captains, Alonzo Monroy and Pedro Miranda, with six companions, whose spurs, bits, and stirrups he directed to be made of gold, hoping to entice, by this proof of the opulence of the country, his fellowcitizens to come to his assistance. These messengers, though escorted by SO men on horseback, who were ordered to accompany them to the borders of Chile, were attacked and defeated by 100]   ==[[Chile|CHILE]]==,  [archers ofCopiapo, commanded by Coteo, an officer of the ulmen of that province. Of the whole band none escaped with life but the two officers, Monroy and Miranda, who were brought covered with wounds before the ulmen. 12. The compassionate uhnena.—M hilst that prince, who had resolved to put them to death, as enemies of the country, was deliberating on the mode, the ulmena, or princess, his wife, moved with compassion for their situation, interceded with her husband for their lives ; and having obtained her request, unbound them with her own hands, tenderly dressed their wounds, and treated them like brothers. When they were fully recovered, she desired them to teach her son the art of riding, as several of the horses had been taken alive in the defeat. The two Spaniards readily consented to her request, hoping to avail themselves of this opportunity to recover their liberty. But the means they took to effect this, were marked with an act of ingratitude to their benefactress, of so much the deeper dye, as, from their not being strictly guarded, such an expedient was unnecessary. As the young prince was one day riding between them, escorted by his archers, and preceded by an officer armed with a lance, Monroy suddenly attacked him with a poniard which he carried about him, and brought him to the ground with two or three mortal wounds ; Miranda at the same time wresting the lance from the officer, they forced their way through their guards, who were thrown into confusion by such an unexpected event. As they were wellmounted, they easily escaped pursuit, and taking their way through the deserts of Peru, arrived at Cuzco, the residence at that time of Vasca de Castro, who had succeededed to the government upon the death of Pizarro, cruelly assassinated by the partizans of Almagro. 
13. Recruits from Peru under Monroy.— On being informed of the critical situation of Chile, Castro immediately dispatched a considerable number of recruits by land, under the command of Monroy, who had the good fortune to conceal his march from the Copiapins, and at the same time gave directions to Juan Bautista. Pastene, a noble Genoese, to proceed thither by sea M'ith a still greater number. Valdivia, on receiving these two reinforcements, which arrived nearly at the same time, began to carry his greatdesignsinto execution. As he had been solicitous from the first to have a complete knowledge of the seacoast, he ordered Pastene to explore it, and note the situation of the most important parts and places, as far as the straits of Magellan. On his return from this expedition, he sent him back to Peru for new recruits, as since the affair ofCopiapo, the natives became daily more bold and enterprising. 
14. Stratagem of the Quillotanes.— Among others the Quillotanes had, a little time before, massacred all the soldiers employed in the mines. To this end they made use of the following strata.gem : One of the neighbouring Indians brought to the commander, Gonzalo Bios, a pot full of gold, telling him that he had found a great quantity of it in a certain district of the country ; upon this information, all were impatient io proceed thither to participate in the imagined treasure. As they arrived tumultuously at the place described, they easily became victims to an ambuscade which bad been formed for them, not one of them escaping except the imprudent commander and a Negro, who saved themselves by the superior excellence of their horses. The frigate, which wasthen finished, was also destroyed, being burned together with the arsenal. 
15. Serena founded.-~Vs\cYivia, on receiving advice of this disaster, hastened thither with his troops, and having revenged as far as in his power the death of his soldiers, built a fort to protect the miners. Being afterwards reinforced with 300 men from Peru, under the command of Francis Villagran and Christopher Escobar, he became sensible of the necessity of establishinga settlement in the n. part of the kingdom, that might serve as a place of arms, and a protection for the convoys that should come that way. For this purpose he made choice of a beautiful plain at the mouth of the river Coquimbo, which forms a good harbour, where, in 1564, he founded a city called by him Serena, in honour of the place of his birth ; it is not, however, known at present by this appellation, except in geographical treatises, the country name having prevailed, as is the case with all the other European settlements in Chile. 
16. Promaucian allies.— In the ensuing year he began to think of extending his conquests, and for that purpose proceeded into the country of the Promaucians. Contemporary writers have not made mention of any battle that was fought upon this occasion ; but it is not to be supposed that this valiant people, who had with so much glory repulsed the armies of the Inca and of Almagro, would have allowed him, without opposition, to violate their territory. It is, however highly probable that Valdivia, in the frequent incursions which he made upon their frontiers, had discovered the art to persuade them to unite with him against the other Chilians by seducing promises. In fact, the Spanish armies have ever since that period been strengthened by Promaucianl 
3 f J  CHILE.  
[auxiliaries, 'from whence has sprung that rooted antipathy which the Araucanians preserve against the residue of that nation. In the course of the year 1546, Valdivia, having passed the Maule, proceeded in his career of victory to the river Itata ; but being defeated there, he relinquished his plans of proceeding farther, and returned to St. Jago. 
17 '/Valdivia sets sail for Peru, and returns with men and supplies. — Being disappointed in his succours from Peru, he, in 1547, was on the eve of his departure for that country, when Pastenes arrived, but without any men, and bringing news of the civil war which had broken out between the conquerors of the empire ofthelncas. Nevertheless, persuaded that he might reap an advantage from these revolutions, he set sail with Pastene for Peru, taking with him a great quantity of gold; on his arrival he served, in quality of quartermaster-°-eneral, iu the famous battle that decided the fate of Gonzalo Pizarro. Gasca, the president, who under the royal standard had gained the victory, pleased with the service rendered him upon this occasion by Valdivia, confirmed him in his office of governor, and furnishing him with an abundance of military stores, sent him back to Chile with two ships filled with those seditious adventurers, of whom he was glad of an opportunity to be disembarrassed. The Copiapins, eager to revenue the murder of their prince, killed about the same time 40 Spaniards, who had been detached from several squadrons, and were proceeding from Peru to Chile ; and the Coquimbanes, instigated by their persuasion, massacred all the inhabitants of the colony lately founded in their territory, razing the city to its foundation. Francis Aguirre was immediately ordered there, and had several encounters with them with various success. In 1549 he rebuilt the city in a more advantageous situation ; its inhabitants claim him as their founder, and the most distinguished of them boast themselves as his descendants. After a contest of nine years, and almost incredible fatigues, Valdivia, conceiving himself well established in that part of Chile which was under the dominion of the Peruvians, distributed the land among his soldiers, assigning to each, under the title of commandery, a considerable portion, with the inhabitants living thereon. By this means, having quieted the restless ambitiori of his companions, he set out anew on his march for the s. provinces, with a respectable army of Spanish and Promaucian troops. 
18. Conception founded.— After a journey of 390 miles, he arrived, without encountering many obstacles, at the bay of Penco, which had been already explored by Pastene, where, on the 5th of October 1550, he founded a third city, called Concepcion. The situation of this place was very advantageous for commerce from the excellence of its harbour, but, from the lowness of the ground, exposed in earthquakes to inundations of the sea. Accordingly we find it destroyed in this manner by an earthquake that occurred on the 8th of July 1730, and the 24th of May 1751 ; for this reason, the inhabitants established themselves, on the 24th of November 1764, in the valley of Mocha, three leagues s. of Penco, between the rivers Andalien and Biobio, where they founded New Concepcion. The harbour is situated in the middle of the bay called Talgacuano, a little more than two leagues w. of Mocha ; a fort is now all the building that is left at Penco. But to return to our history, the adjacent tribes perceiving the intention of the Spaniards to occupy this important post, gave information of it to their neighbours and friends the Araucanians, who foreseeing that it would not be long before the storm would burst upon their own country, resolved to succour their distressed allies, inx&gt;rder to secure themselves. But before we proceed to relate the events of this war, it may be more advisable to give some account of the character and manners of that warlike people, who have hitherto, with incredible valour, opposed the overwhelming torrent of Spanish conquest, and from henceforward will furnish all the materials of our history. 
Chap. III.,
Of the character and manners of the Araucanians. 1. Local situation. — The Araucanians inhabit that delightful country situate between the rivers Biobio and Valdivia, and between the Andes and the sea, extending from 36° 44' to 39° 50' of r. latitude. They derive their appellation of Araucanians from the province of Arauco, which, though the smallest in their territory, has, like Holland, given its name to the whole nation, either from its having been the first to unite with the neighbouring provinces, or from having at some remote period reduced them under its dominion. This people, ever enthusiastically attached to their independence, pride themselves in being called auca, which signifies frank or free ; and those Spaniards who had left the army in the Netherlands to serve in Chile, gave to this country the name of Araucanian Flanders, or the Invincible State ; and some of them have even had the magnanimity to celebrate in epic poetry the exploits]  

CHILE.  !'of a people, who, to preserve their independence, iave shed such torrents of Spanish blood. 
2. Character. — The Araucanians, although they do not exceed the ordinary height of the human species, are in general muscular, robust, v/ell proportioned, and of a martial appearance. It is very unusual to find among them any person who is crooked or deformed,not from their pursuing, as some have supposed, the cruel custom of the ancient Spartans, of suffocating such unfortunate children, but because they leave to nature the care of forming them, without obstructing her operations by the improper application of bandages and stays. Their complexion, with the exception of the Boroanes, who are fair and ruddy, is of a reddish brown, but yet clearer than that of the other Americans ; they have round faces, small animated eyes full of expression, a nose rather flat, a handsome mouth, even and white teeth, muscular and well shaped legs, and small flat feet ; like the Tartars, they have scarce any beard, and the smallest hair is never to be discerned on their faces, from the care they take to pluck out the little that appears ; they esteem it very impolite to have a beard, calling the Europeans, by way of reproach, the long beards. The same attention is paid to removing the hair from their bodies, where its growth is more abundant ; that of their heads is thick and black, but rather coarse ; they permit it to grow to a great length, and wind it in tresses around their heads ; of this they are as proud and careful as they are averse to beards, nor could a greater affront be offered them than to cut it off. Their women are delicately formed, and many of them, especially among the Boroanes, arc very handsome. Possessed of great strength of constitution, and unencumbered j with the cares that disturb civilized society, they are not subject, except at a very advanced period of life, to the infirmities attendant upon old age ; they rarely begin to be grey before they are 60 or 70, and are not bald or wrinkled until 80 ; they are generally longer lived than the Spaniards, and many are to be met with whose age exceeds 100 ; and to the latest period of their lives, they retain their sight, teeth, and memory unimpaired. Their moral qualities are proportionate to their personal endowments ; they are intrepid, animated, ardent, patient in enduring fatigue, ever ready to sacrifice their lives in the service of their country, enthusiastic lovers of liberty, which they consider as an essential constituent of their existence, jealous of their honour, courteous, hospitable, faithful to their engagements, grateful for services rendered them, and generous and humane towards  the vanquished. But these noble qualities are obscured by the vices inseparable from the half savage state of life which they lead, unrefined by literature or cultivation; these are drunkenness, debauchery, presumption, and a haughty contempt for all other nations. Were the civil manners and innocent improvements of Europe introduced among them, they would soon become a people deserving of universal esteem; but under the present system, this happy change appears impossible to be effected. 
3. Dress. — All those nations, whom either the nature of the climate or a sense of decency has induced to clothe themselves, have made use at first of loose garments, as being the most easily made. But the Araucanians, from their great attachment to war, which they consider as the only true source of glory, have adopted the short garment, as best suited to martial conflicts ; this dress is made of wool, as was that of the Greeks and Romans, and consists of a shirt, a vest, a pair of short close breeches, and a cloak in form of a scapulary, with an opening in the middle for the head, made full and long so as to cover the hands and descend to the knees ; this cloak is called poncho, and is much more commodious than our mantles, as it leaves the arms at liberty, and may be thrown over the shoulder at pleasure ; it is also a better protection from the wind and the rain, and more convenient for riding on horseback, for which reason it is commonly worn, not only by the Spaniards in Chile, but by those of Peru and Paraguay. The shirt, vest, and breeches are always of a greenish blue, or turquois, which is the favourite colour of the nation, as red is that of the Tartars. The poncho is also, among persons of inferior condition, of a greenish blue; but those of the higher classes wear it of different colours, either white, red, or blue, with stripes a span broad, on which are wrought, with much skill, figures of flowers and animals in various colours, and the border is ornamented with a handsome fringe : some of these ponchos are of so fine and elegant a texture as to be sold for 150 dollars. The Araucanians make use of neither turbans nor hats, but wear upon their heads a bandage of embroidered wool, in the form of the ancient diadem ; this, whenever they salute, they raise a Uttle as a mark of courtesy, and on going to war ornament it with a number of beautiful plumes ; they also wear around the body a long woollen girdle or sash handsomely wrought. Persons of rank wear woollen boots of various colours, and leather sandals, called chelle, but the common people always go barefooted. The women are clad with much   CHILE.  
[modesty and simplicity ; their dress is entirely of wool, and, agreeable to the natural taste, of a greenish blue coiour ; it consists of a tunic, a girdle, and a short cloak, called ichella, which is fastened before with a silver buckle. The tunic, called chiamal, is long, and descends to the feet ; it is without sleeves, and is fastened upon the shoulder by silver broches or buckles ; this dress, sanctioned by custom, is never varied ; but to gratify their love of finery, they adorn themselves with all those trinkets which caprice or vanity suggests. They divide their hair into several tresses, which float in graceful negligence over their shoulders, and decorate their heads with a species of false emerald, called glianca, held by them in high estimation; their necklaces and bracelets are of glass, and their earrings, which are square, of silver; they have rings upon each finger, the greater part of which are of silver. It is calculated that more than 100,000 marks of this metal are employed in these female ornaments, since they are worn even by the poorest class. 
4. Dwellings. — We have already given some account of the dwellings of the ancient Chilians : the Araucanians, tenacious, as are all nations not corrupted by luxury, of the customs of their country, have made no change in their mode of building. But as they are almost all polygamists, the size of their houses is proportioned to the number of women they can maintain ; the interior of these houses is very simple ; the luxury of convenience^ splendour, and show, is altogether unknown in them, and necessity alone is consulted in the selection of their furniture. They never form towns, but live in scattered villages or hamlets on the banks of rivers, or in plains that are easily irrigated. Their local attachments are strong, each family preferring to live upon the land inherited from its ancestors, which they cultivate sufficiently for their subsistence. The genius of this haughty people, in which the savage still predominates, will not permit them to live in walled cities, which they consider as a mark of servitude. 
5. Division of the Araucanian state.— Although in their settlements the Araucanians are wanting in regularity, that is by no means the case in the political division of their state, which is regulated with much nicety and intelligence. They have divided it from n. to s. into four uthalmapus, or parallel tetrarchates, that are nearly equal, to which they give the names of Lauqucnmapu, the maritime country ; Lclbunmapu^ the plain country ; Inapiremapit, the country at the foot of the Andes; and Piremapu, or that of the Andes.  
Each uthalmapu is divided into five aillaregues or provinces; and each aillaregue, into nine regues or counties. The maritime country comprehends the provinces of Arauco, Tucapel, lllicura, Boroa, and Nagtolten ; the country of the plain includes those of Encol, Puren, Reposura, Maquegua, and Mariquiua ; that at the foot of the Andes contains Marven, Colhue, Chacaico, Quecheregua, and Guanagua ; and in that of the Andes is included all the valleys of the Cordilleras, situate within the limits already mentioned, which are inhabited by the Puelches. These mountaineers, who were formerly a distinct nation, in alliance with the Araucanians, are now united under their government, and have the same magistrates. In the second and third articles of the regulations of Lonquilmo, made in the year 1784, the limits of each uthalmapu are expressly defined, and its districts marked out. It declares to be appertaining to that of the cordilleras, the Huilliches of Changolo, those of Gayolto and Rucachoroy, to the s. ; the Puelches and Indian pampas to the n. from Malalque and the frontiers of Mendoza to the Mamilmapu in the pampas of Buenos Ayres ; the whole forming a corporate body with the Puelches and Pehuenches of Maule, Chilian, and Antuco ; so that at present, in case of an infraction of the treaty, it may easily be known what uthalmapu is to make satisfaction. This division of Araucania, which discovers a certain degree of refinement in its political administration, is of a date anterior to the arrival of the Spaniards, and serves as a basis for the civil government of the Araucanians, which is aristocratic, as that of many other barbarous nations has been. This species of republic consists of three orders of nobility, each subordinate to the other; the toquis, the apoulmenes, and the ulmenes, all jf whom have their respective vassals. The toquis, who may be styled tetrarchs, are four in number, and preside over the uthalmapus. The appellation of toqui is derived from the verb toquin, which signifies to judge or command ; they are independent of each other, but confederated ^.for the public welfare. The apoulmenes or archulmenes govern the provinces under their respective toquis. The ulmenes, who are the prefects of the regues or counties, are dependent upon the apoulmenes; this dependence, however, is confined almost entirely to military affairs. Although the ulmenes are the lowest in the scale of the Araucanian aristocracy, the superior ranks, generally speaking, are comprehended under the same title, which is equivalent to that of cacique. The discriminative badge of the toqui is a species of battleaxe, made]   ■^■■■■HS  

CHILE.  [of porphyry or marble. The apoulmenes and the ulmenes carry staves with silver heads, but the first, by way of distinction, have a ring of the same metal around the middle of their staves. All these dignities are hereditary in the male line, and proceed in the order of primogeniture. Thus have the dukes, the counts, and marquises of the military aristocracy of the north been established, from time immemorial, under different names, in a corner of South America. With its resemblance to the feudal system, this government contains also almostall its defects. The toqui possesses but the shadow of sovereign authority. The triple power that constitutes it is vested in the great body of the nobility, who decide every important question, in the manner of the ancient Germans or modern Poles, in a general diet, which is called butacoyog or aucacoi/og, the great council, or council of the Araucanians. This assembly is usually held in some large plain, where they combine the pleasures of the table with their public deliberations. Their code of laws, which is traditionary, is denominated admapUy that is to say, the customs of the country. In reality, these laws are nothing more than primordial usages or tacit conventions, that have been established among them, as was originally the case with almost all the laws of other nations; they have consequently all the defects peculiar to such sv stems. 
6. Its political form. — The clearest and most explicit of their political and fundamental laws are those that regulate the limits of each authority, the order of succession in toquiates and in the ulmenates, the confederation of the four tetrarchates, the choice of the power of the commanders in chief in time of war, and the right of convoking the general diets, which is the privilege of the toquis ; all these laws have for their object the preservation of liberty, and the established form of government. According to them, two or more states cannot be held under the rule of the same chief. Whenever the male branch of the reigning family becomes extinct, the vassals recover their natural right of electing their own chief from that family which is most pleasing to them. But before he is installed, he must be presented to the toqui of their uthalmapu, who gives notice of his election, in order that the new chief may be acknowledged and respected by all in that quality. The subjects are not, as under the feudal government, liable to a levy, or to any kind of personal service, except in time of war. Neither are they obliged to pay any contributions to their chiefs, who must subsist themselves by means of their own property. They respect them,  however, as their superiors, or rather as the first among their equals ; they also attend to their decisions, and escort them whenever they go out of the state. These chiefs, elated with their authority, would gladly extend its limits, and govern as absolute masters; but the people, who cannot endure despotism, oppose their pretensions, and compel them to keep within the bounds prescribed by their customs. 
7. Civil institutions. — The civil laws of a society whose manners are simple, and interests but little complicated, cannot be very numerous. The Araucanians have but a few; these, however, would be sufficient for their state of life, if they were more respected and less arbitrary. Their system of criminal jurisprudence, in a particular manner, is very imperfect. The offences that are deemed deserving of" capital punishment are treachery, intentional homicide, adultery, the robbery of any valuable article, and witchcraft. Nevertheless, those found guilty of homicide can screen themselves from punishment by a composition with the relations of the murdered. Husbands and fathers are not subject to any punishment for killing their wives or children, as they are declared by, their laws to be the natural masters of their lives.. Those accused of sorcery, a crime chiefly known in countries involved in ignorance, are first tortured by fire, in order to make them discover their accomplices, and then stabbed with daggers. Other crimes, of less importance, are punished by retaliation, which is much in use among them, under the name of thaulonco. Justice is administered in a tumultuous and irregular manner, and without any of those preliminary formalities that are observed among civilized nations. The criminal who is convicted of a capital offence is immediately put to death, according to the military custom, without being suffered to rot in prison ; a mode of confinement unknown to the Araucanians. It has, however, lately been introduced into Tucapel, the seat of the government of Lauquenmapu, by Cathicura, the then toqui of that district; but the success of this experiment, which was at first very ill received by his subjects, is supposed generally to have failed. The ulmenes are the lawful judges of their vassals, and for this reason their authority is less precarious. The unconquerable pride of this people prevents them from adopting the wise measures of public justice ; they merely possess some general and vague ideas upon the principles of political union, whence the executive power being without force, distributive justice is ill administered, or entirely abandoned to the caprice of individuals. The injured]   ** -_*  CHILE.  
[family often assumes the right of pursuing the aggressor or Ills relations, and of punishing them. From this abuse are derived the denominations and distinctions, so much used in their jurisprudence, of genguerin, gengunuui, genla, &amp;c. denoting the principal connections of the aggressor, of the injured, or the deceased, who are supposed to be authorised, by the laws of nature, to support by force the rights of their relatives. A system of judicial proceedings so irregular, and apparently so incompatible with the existence of any kind of civil society, becomes the constant source of disorders entirely hostile to the primary object of all good government, and public and private security. When those who are St enmity have a considerable number of adherents, they mutually make incursions upon each other's possessions, where they destroy or burn all that they cannot carry off. These private quarrels, called malocas, resemble much the feuds of the ancient Germans, and are very dreadful when the ulmenes are concerned, in which case they become real civil wars. But it must be acknowledged, that they are generally unaccompanied with the effusion of blood, and are confined to pillage alone. This people, notwithstanding their propensity to violence, rarely employ arms in their private quarrels, but decide them with the fist or with the club. 
8. Military system. — The military government of the Araucanians is not only more rational and better systematized than the civil, but in some respects appears to be superior to the genius of an uncultivated nation. Whenever the grand council determines to go to war, they proceed immediately to the election of a commander in chief, to which the toquis have the first claim, as being the hereditary generals or stadtholders of the republic. If neither of them is deemed qualified for the command, dismissing all regard for rank, they entrust it to the most deserving of the ulmenes, or even the officers of the common class, as the talents necessary for this important station are what alone are required. In consequence, Vilumilla, a man of low origin, commanded the Araucanian army, with much honour, in the war of 1722 ; and Curignanca, the younger son of the ulmen of the province of Encol, in that which terminated in 1773. On accepting his appointment, the new general assumes the title of toqui, and the stone hatchet, in token of supreme command ; at which time the native toquis lay aside theirs, it not being lawful for them to carry them during the government of this dictator. They likewise, sacrificing private ambition to the public good, take the oaths of obedience and fealty to him, to-  gether with the other ulmenes. Even the people, who in peace shew themselves repugnant to all subordination, are then prompt to obey, and submissive to the will of their military sovereign. He cannot, however, put any one to death without the consent of the principal officers of his army ; but as these are of his own appointment, his orders may be considered as absolute. From the arrival of the Spaniards in the country to the present time, it is observable, that all the toquis who have been appointed in time of war were natives ofthe provinces of Arauco, of Tucapel, of Encol, or of Puren. Whether this partiality be owing to some superstitious notion, or rather to some ancient law or agreement, we are unable to determine ; it appears, however, to be repugnant to the principles of sound policy, as it is very jare for the component parts of a state to maintain themselves long in any sort of union when they do not all participate equally in the advantages of the government. But it is a peculiarity worthy of admiration, that this discrimination has hitherto produced no division among them. One of the first measures of the national council, after having decided upon war, is to dispatch certain messengers or expresses, called guerquenis, to the confederate tribes, and even to those Indians who live among the Spaniards, to inform the first of the steps that have beeu taken, and to request, the others to make a common cause with their countrymen. The credentials of these envoys are some small arrows tied together witha red string, the symbol of blood. But if hostilities are actually commenced, the finger, or (as Alcedo will have it) the hand of a slain enemy is joined to the arrows. This embassy, called pulchitum, to run the arrow, is performed with such secrecy and expedition in the Spanish settlements that the messengers are rarely discovered. The toqui directs what number of soldiers are to be furnished by each uthalmapu ; the tetrarchs, in their turn, regulate the contingencies of the apoulmenes, and these last apportion them among their respective ulmenes. Every Araucanian is born a soldier. All are ready to proffer their services for war, so that there is no difficulty in raising an army, wMch usually consists of five or six thousand men, besides the corps de reserve, which are kept in readiness for particular occasions, or to replace those killed in battle. The commander in chief appoints his vicetoqui, or lieutenantgeneral, and the other officers of his staff, who in their turn nominate their subaltern officers : by this method harmony and subordination are maintained between the respective commanders. The vicetoqui is almost always selected from among the]  

CHILE.  
[Puelches, in order to satisfy that valiant tribe, who amount to the fourth part of the population of the state. Nor have the Araucanians ever had cause to repent of this selection. During the last war, one of these mountaineers, Leviantu, lieutenantgeneral of Curignancu, harassed the Spaniards greatly, and gave their troops constant employment. The army is at present composed of infantry and of horse. It originally consisted entirely of the former; but in their first battles with the Spaniards, perceiving the great advantages which their enemies derived from their cavalry, they soon began to discipline themselves in the same manner. Their first care was to procure a good breed of horses, which in a short - time became so numerous, that in the year 1568, seventeen years after their first opposing the Spanish arms, they were able to furnish several squadrons ; and in the year 1585, the cavalry was first regularly organized by the Toqui Cadeguala. The infantry, which they call namuntulinco, is divided into regiments and companies : each regiment consists of one thousand men, and contains ten companies of one hundred. The cavalry is divided in like manner, but the number of horse is not always the same. They have all their particular standards, but each bears a star, which is the national device. The soldiers are not clothed in uniform, according to the European custom, but all wear beneath their usual dress cuirasses of leather, hardened by a peculiar mode of dressing ; their shields and helmets are also made of the same material. 
9. Their army and mode of making war. — The cavalry is armed with swords and lances; the infantry with pikes or clubs pointed with iron. They formerly employed bows and slings, in the use of which they were very dexterous ; but since the arrival of the Spaniards, they have almost entirely relinquished them ; experience having taught them to avoid the destructive effect of their musketry, by immediately closing in, and fighting hand to hand with the enemy. The art of making gunpowder is as yet unknown to this warlike people. Either they regard it but little, or, what is more probable, those Spaniards with whom they have sometimes traded would not, if they were themselves acquainted with it, communicate to them the composition. It is, however, believed that they made use at first of the greatest exertions •to obtain the knowledge of this secret, so important in the present system of warfare. The discovery of powder is well ascertained to have been owing more to accident than to the efforts of human ingenuity, although some pretend that it was known  in China long before the period that it was discocovered in Europe. The inhabitants of the country relate the following anecdote respecting gunpowder, which, however fabulous and absurd it may appear, is generally credited. The Araucanians, on first seeing Negroes with the Spaniards, imagined that they prepared from them the powder which they used. Soon after, having taken one of those unfortunate men, they first covered him with stripes from head to foot, and afterwards burned him to a coal, in order, by reducing it to powder, to obtain the so much wishedfor secret ; but were soon convinced of the fallacy of their chemical principles. In their various encounters with the Spaniards, they occasionally took from them powder and muskets, which, in the subsequent battles, they employed with as much skill as if they had been for a long time accustomed to them ; but as soon as the powder was expended, they were forced to resume their former arms. The Dutch, when they took the city of Valdivia, attempted to form an alliance with them, and promised to supply them with powder and cannon ; but as they distrusted all Europeans, they would not listen to their proposal. Before setting out on his expedition, the general assigns three days for consultation, in order to consider anew the plans of the campaign, and to adopt the best expedients. Upon this occasion every one has the liberty of offering his opinion, if he deems it conducive to the public welfare. In the mean time the general consults in secret with the officers of his staff Upon the plans which he has formed, and the means of remedying sinister events. After this the army commences its march to the sound of drums, being always preceded by several advanced parties, in order to prevent a surprise. The infantry, as well as cavalry, proceed on horseback ; but on coming to action, they immediately dismount, and form themselves into their respective companies. Each soldier is obliged to bring from home not only his arms, but his supply of provisions, according to the custom of the Ilomans. As all are liable to military service, so no one in particular is obliged to contribute to the support of the army. The provision consists in a small sack of parched meal for each, which, diluted with water, furnishes sufficient food for them until they are enabled to live at free quarters upon the enemy. The Araucanian troops are extremely vigilant; they adopt at night the most prudent measures, by encamping in secure and advantageous positions. On these occasions centinels are placed upon all sides ; and in presence of the enemy they re-]  CHILE.  
[double their precautions, and strengthen the posts they occupy with strong entrenchments. Every soldier during night is obliged, in order to prove his vigilance, to keep up a fire before his tent : the great number of these fires serves to deceive the enemy, and have at a distance a very singular appearance. They are, besides, well acquainted with the art of constructing military works, and of protecting themselves with deep ditches, which they guard with branches of thorn, and strew caltrops in the environs to repress the incursions of the enemy's horse. In short, there are few military stratagems that they do not employ at a proper time and place. The celebrated Spanish poet Ercilla, who fought against them under Don Garcia, expresses his admiration at meeting with troops so well disciplined, and possessing such perfection in tactics, which, to use his expressions, the most celebrated nations in the world have not been able to attain without great trouble, and after a long course of years. When an action becomes necessary, they separate the cavalry into two wings, and place the infantry in the centre, divided into several battalions, the files being composed alternately of pikemen and soldiers armed with clubs, in such a manner, that between every two pikes a club is always to be found. The vicetoqui has the command of the right wing, and that of the left is committed to an experienced officer. The toqui is present every where, as occasion may require, and exhorts his men with much eloquence to fight valiantly for their liberties. But of this there appears little need, as the soldiers manifest such ardour, that their officers have much more difficulty in restraining their impetuosity than in exciting them to action. Fully impressed with the opinion, that to die in battle is the greatest honour that a man can acquire in this life, on the signal for combat being given, they advance desperately, shouting in a terrific manner ; and notwithstanding the slaughter made among them by the cannon, endeavour to penetrate the centre of the enemy. Though they know full well that the first ranks will be exposed to almost certain destruction, they eagerly contend with each other for these posts of honour, or to serve as leaders of the files. As soon as the first line is cut down, tJtie, second occupies its place, and then the third, until they finally succeed in breaking the front ranks of the enemy. In the midst of their fury they nevertheless preserve the strictest order, and perform all the evolutions directed by their officers. The most terrible of them are the clubbearers, who, like so many Hercules, destroy with their  ironpointed maces all whom they meet in their way. 
10. Division of the spoil. — The spoils of war are divided among those who have had the good fortune to take them. But when the capture has been general, they are distributed among the whole in equal parts, called reg, so that no preference is shown to any of the officers, nor even to the toqui. The prisoners, according to the custom of all barbarous nations, are made slaves, until they are exchanged or ransomed. According to the admapu, one of these unfortunate men must be sacrificed to the manes of the soldiers killed in the war. This cruel law, traces of which are to be found in the annals of almost all nations, is nevertheless very rarely put in practice, but one or two instances having occurred in the space of nearly 200 years. The Araucanians are sensible to the dictates of compassion, although the contrary is alleged by certain writers, who having assumed as an incontrovertible principle, that they never give quarter to their enemies, afterwards contradict themselves in mentioning the great number of prisoners who have either been exchanged or ransomed after the war. 
11. Sacrifice after the war. — The sacrifice above mentioned, called pru/oneon, or the dance of the head, is performed in the following manner : The officers, surrounded by the soldiers, form a circle, in the centre ofwhich, in the midst of four poniards, representing the four uthalmapus, is placed the official axe of the toqui. The unfortunate prisoner, as a mark of ignominy, is then led in upon a horse deprived of his ears and tail, and placed near the axe, with his face turned towards his country. They afterwards give him a handful of small sticks and a sharp stake, with which they oblige him to dig a hole in the ground ; and in this they order him to cast the sticks one by one, repeating the names of the principal warriors of his country, while at the same time the surrounding soldiers load these abhorred names with the bitterest execrations. He is then ordered to cover the hole, as if to bury therein the reputation and valour of their enemies, whom he has named. After this ceremony the toqui, or one of his bravest companions, to whom he relinquishes the honour of the execution, dashes out the brains of the prisoner with a club. The heart is immediately taken out by two attendants, and presented palpitating to the general, who sucks a little of the blood, and passes it to his officers, who repeat in succession the same ceremony ; in the mean time he fumigates with tobacco smoke from his pipe the four cardinal]    BVDi    CHILE.  
[points of. the circle. The soldiers strip the flesh from the bones, and make of them flutes ; then, cutting oft' the head, carry it round upon a pike, amidst the acclamations of the multitude, while, stamping in measured pace, they thunder out their dreadful warsong, accompanied by the mournful sound of these horrid instruments. This barbarous festival is terminated by applying to the mangled body the head of a sheep, which is succeeded by a scene of riot and intoxication. Jf the skull should not be broken by the blows of the club, they make of it a cup, called ralilonco, which they use in their banquets in the manner of the ancient Scythians and Goths. 
12. Congress of peace. — On the termination of a war, a congress is assembled, called by the Spaniards portamento, and the Araucanians huincacoyag. This is usually held in a delightful plain, between the rivers Biobio and Duqueco, on the confines of both territories, whither the Spanish president and the Araucanian toqui repair with the attendants agreed upon in the preliminary articles. The four uthalmapus send at the same time four deputies, who are usually the tetrarchs themselves, and whose unanimous consent is requisite for the establishment and ratification of peace. In the congress which was held after the war of 1723, were present ISO ulmenes, with their attendants, who amounted to the number of 2000 men. The camps of the negociating parties were separated by an interval of two miles. The conference is commenced with many compliments on either side, and in token of future friendship, they bind the staves of the ulmenes with that of the Spanish president together, and place them in the midst of the assembly : an Araucanian orator then presents a branch of cinnamon, which is with them the token of peace, and placing his left hand upon the bundle of staves, makes, in the Chilian language, a pertinent harangue on the causes which produced the war, and the most eligible means of preserving harmony between the two nations. He then proceeds with much eloquence to point out the losses and miseries occasioned by war, and the advantages which are derived from peace, to which he exhorts the chiefs of either party in a pathetic peroration. An interpreter then explains the precise meaning of all that the Araucanian has said. The Spanish president replies in another speech adapted to the subject, which is interpreted in the same manner. The articles of the treaty are then agreed upon, and are ratified by a sacrifice of several chilineques, or Chilian camels, which the Araucanians immolate for the happy continuance of the peace. After this the president dines at the same table with the toqui and the principal ulmenes, to whom he makes the customary presents in the name of his sovereign. This parliament is renewed as often as a new president is sent from Spain to Chile, and cannot possibly be dispensed with, as in that case the Araucanians, imagining themselves despised, would without any other cause commence war. For this reason, there is always a considerable sum ready in the royal treasury for the expences necessary on these occasions. On the arrival of a new president, an envoy, called the national commissary, is dispatched in his name to the four uthalmapus, to invite the toquis and the other ulmenes to meet him at the place appointed, for the purpose of becoming acquainted with each other, and to confirm the friendship contracted with his predecessors. In this convention nearly the same ceremonies are practised as are made use of on ratifying a treaty of peace. The ulmenes collect upon this occasion in great numbers, not only for the purpose of becoming personally acquainted with the new governor, but to form an opinion, from his manners and countenance, of his pacific or warlike disposition. A great number of merchants are attracted to the place where this meeting is held, and they form a kind of fair, which is mutually advantageous to both nations. 
13. System of religion. — The religious system of the Araucanians is simple, and well adapted to their free manner of thinking and of living. They acknowledge a Supreme Being, the Author of all things, whom they call Pillan, a word derived from pulli or pill/, the soul, and signifies the Supreme Essence ; they also call him Guemtpill 'an, the Spirit of Heaven ; Butagen, the Great Being ; Thalcove, the Thunderer ; Vikemvoe, the Creator of all; Vilpepihoe, the Omnipotent; Mol/gelu } the Eternal ; Aonolu, the Infinite, &amp;c. The universal government of the Pillan is a prototype of the Araucanian polity. He is the great toqui of the invisible world, and as such, has his apoulmenes, and his ulmenes, to whom he entrusts the administration of affairs of less importance. In the first class of these subaltern divinities is the Epunamun, or god of war ; the Meulen, a benevolent deity, the friend of the human race; and the Guecnbu, a malignant being, the author of all evil, who appears to be the same as the Algue. From hence it appears, that the doctrine of two adverse principles, called Manicheism, is very extensive. The Guecubu is the Mavari of the Oronoques, and the Aherman of the Persians. He is, according to the general opinion of the Araucanians, the etfieient cause of all the misfortunes that occur. If a horse tires, it is because the Guecubu has rode him. If} 3 a   410  

CHILE.  
[an earthquake happens, the Gtiecubu has given it a shock ; nor does any one die that is not suffocated by the Guecubu. The ulraenes of their celestial hierarchy are the genii, who have the charge of all created things, and who, in concert with the benevolent Meulen, form a counterpoise to the enormous power of Guecubu. They are of both sexes, male and female, who always continue pure and chaste, propagation being unknown to their system of the spiritual world. The males are  called get?, that is,  lords, unless this word should  be the same as the ginn of the Arabians. The females are called ameimalghen, which signifies spiritual nymphs or fairies, and perform for men the offices of lures, or familiar spirits. There is not an Araucanian but imagines he has one of these in his service. Men cat gni amchimalghen, " 1 keep my nymph still," is a common expression when they succeed in an undertaking. The Araucariians carry still farther their ideas of the analogy between the celestial government and their own ; for as their ulmenes have not the right of imposing any species of service or contributions upon their subjects, still less, in their opinion, should those of celestial race require it of man, since they have no occasion for it. Governed by these singular opinions, they pay to them no exterior worship. They have neither temples nor idols, nor are they accustomed to offer any sacrifices, except in cases of some severe calamity, or on concluding a peace; at such times they sacrifice animals, and burn tobacco, which they think is the incense the most agreeable to their deities. Nevertheless they invoke them and implore their aid upon urgent oc* easions, addressing themselves principally to Pillan and to Meulen. To this little regard for religion, lis owing the indifference which they have manifested at the introduction of Christianity among them, which is tolerated in all the provinces of their dominion. The missionaries are there much respected, well treated, and have full liberty of publicly preaching their tenets, but notwithstanding there are but few of the natives who are converted. If the Araucanians discover little regard for their deities, they are, however, very superstitious in many points of less importance. They firmly believe in divination, and pay the greatest attention to such favourable or unfavourable omens as the capaciousness of their imagination may suggest. These idle observations are particularly directed to dreams, to the singing and flight of birds, which are esteemed by the whole of them the truest interpreters of the will of the gods. The fearless Araucanian, who with incredible valour confronts death in battle, trembles at the sight of an owl.  
Their puerile weakness in this respect would appear incompatible with the strength of their intellect, if the history of the human mind did not furnish us with continual examples of similar contradictions. They consult upon all occasions their diviners, or pretenders to a knowledge of futurity, who are sometimes called gligua or gugol t among whom are some who pass for genpugnu, genpiru, Sec. which signifies masters of the heavens, of epidemic diseases, and of worms or insects ; and, like the llamas of Tibet, boast of being able to produce rain, of having the power to cure all disorders, and to prevent the ravages of the worms which destroy the corn. They are in great dread of the calcus, or pretended sorcerers, who, they imagine, keep concealed by day in caverns with their disciples, called ivmiehes, mananimals, and who at night transform themselves into nocturnal birds, make incursions in the air, and shoot invisible arrows at their enemies. Their superstitious credulity is particularly obvious in the serious stories which they relate of apparitions, phantoms, and hobgoblins; respecting which they have innumerable tales. But, in truth, is there a nation on earth so far removed from credulity in that particular, as to claim a right of laughing at the Araucanians ? They have, nevertheless, some among them who are philosophers enough to despise such, credulity as an absurdity, and to laugh at the folly of their countrymen. They are all, however, agreed in the belief of the immortality of the soul. This consolatory truth is deeply rooted, and in a manner innate with them. They hold that man is composed of two substances essentially different : the corruptible body, which they call anca, and the soul, am or pulli, which they say is ancanolu, incorporeal, and mugealu, eternal, or existing for ever. This distinction is so fully established among them, that they frequently make use of the word anca metaphorically, to denote a part, the half, or the subject of any thing. As respects the state of the soul after its separation from the body, they are not however agreed. All concur in saying, with the other American tribes, that after death they go towards the w. beyond the sea, to a certain place called Gnlcheman ; that is, the dwelling of the men beyond the mountains. But some believe that this country is divided into two parts, one pleasant, and filled with every thing delightful, the abode of the good ; and the other desolate, and in want of every thing, the habitation of the wicked. Others are of opinion that all indiscriminately enjoy there eternal pleasures, pretending that the deeds of this life have no influence upon a future state.]   CHILE.  
[14. Funeral ceremonies, —Notwithstanding they know the difference between the body and the soul, their ideas of the spirituality of the latter do not seem to be very distinct, as appears from the ceremonies practised at their funerals. As soon as one of their nation dies, his friends and relations seat themselves upon the ground around the body, and weep for a long time ; they afterwards expose it, clothed in the best dress of the deceased, upon a high bier, called pilluay, where it remains during the night, which they pass near it in weeping, or in eating and drinking with those who come to console them ; this meeting is called curicahum, the black entertainment, as that colour is among them, as well as the Europeans, the symbol of mourning. The following day, though sometimes not until the second or third after the decease of the person, they carry the corpse in procession to the eltun, or burying place of the family, which is usually situated in a wood or on a hill ; two . young men on horseback, riding full speed, precede the procession . The bier is carried by the principal relations, and is surrounded by women, who bewail the deceased in the manner of the hired mourners among the Romans ; while another ■woman, who walks behind, strews ashes in the road, to prevent the soul from returning to its late abode. On arriving at the place of burial, the corpse is laid upon the surface of the ground, and surrounded, if a man, with his arms, if a woman, with female implements, and with a great quantity of provisions, and with vessels filled with chica, and with wine, which according to their opinions are necessary to subsist them during their passage to another world ; they sometimes even kill a horse, and inter it in the same ground. After these ceremonies, they take leave with many tears of the deceased, wishing him a prosperous journey, and cover the corpse with earth and stones placed in a pyramidal form, upon which they pour a great quantity of chica. The similarity between these funeral rites and those practised by the ancients must be obvious to those acquainted with the customs of the latter. Immediately after the relations have quitted the deceased, an old woman, called Tempulcague, comes, as the Araucanians believe, in the shape of a whale, to transport him to the Elysian fields ; but before his arrival there, he is obliged to pay a toll, for passing a very narrow strait, to another malicious old woman who guards it, and who, on failure, deprives the passenger of an eye. This fable resembles much that of the ferryman Charon, not that there is any probability that the one was copied from the other ; as the human mind, when placed in similar situations,  will give birth to the same ideas. The soul, when separated from the body, exercises in another lite the same functions it performed in this, with no other difference except that they are unaccompanied with fatigue or satiety; husbands have there the same wives as they had on earth, but the latter have no children, as that happy country cannot be inhabited by any except the spirits of the dead ; and every thing there is spiritual. According to their theory, the soul, notwithstanding its new condition of life, never loses its original attachments ; and when the spirits of their countrymen return, as they frequently do, they fiVht furiously with those of their enemies whenever they meet with them in the air ; and these combats are the origin of tempests, thunder, and lightning. Not a storm happens upon the Andes or the ocean which they do not ascribe to a battle between the souls of their fellowcountry- -men and those of the Spaniards; they say that the roaring of the wind is the trampling of their horses ; the noise of the thunder that of their drums and the flashes of lightning the fire of their artillery! If the storm takes its course towards the Spanish territory, they affirm that their spirits have put to flight those of the Spaniards, and exclaim triumphantly, Inavimen, inavimen, puen, laguvirnen ! M Pursue them, friends, pursue them, kill them!" If the contrary happens, they are greatly afflicted, and call out in consternation, favulumen, puen, namuntumen! " Courage, friends be firm!" Thus do they believe that the dead.'al. though mere spirits, are possessed, like the sha. dows which thronged about ^Eneas in his descent into the infernal regions, of the same passions, and a love of the same pursuits, by which they were actuated when living. 
" Quce gratia curruum Armorumquc fuit vivis, quae euro nitenles Pascere equos, eadem sequilur tellure repostos." 
Their ideas respecting the origin of creation are so crude and ridiculous, that to relate them would serve for little else than to shew the weakness of human reason when left to itself. They have among them the tradition of a great delude, in which only a few persons were saved, who 3 took refuge upon a high mountain, called Thegthez the thunderiug, or the sparkling, which /had three points, and possessed the property of moving upon the water. From hence it is to be inferred, that this deluge was in consequence of some volcanic eruption, accompanied by terrible earthquakes, or should appear to he a corrupted tradition of Noah's flood.

[tains, which 'they fancy to be of a similar appearance, and which, of course, as they suppose, must possess the same property of floating upon the water, assigning as a reason, that they are fearful after an earthquake that the sea will again return and deluge the world. On these occasions, each one takes a good supply of provisions, and wooden plates to protect their heads from being scorched, provided the Tkegtkeg, when raised by the waters, should be elevated to the sun. Whenever they are told that plates made of earth would be much more suitable for this purpose than those of wood, which are liable to be burned, their usual reply is, that their ancestors did so before them. 
15. Division of time.— 'Time is divided by the Araucanians, as with us, into years, seasons, months, days, and hours, but in a very different method. Their year is solar, and begins on the 22d of December, or immediately after the southern solstice ; for this reason they call this solstice thaumathipantu, the head and tail of the year, and denominate June» Udanthipantu, the divider of the year, from its dividing it into two equal parts. These two essential points they are able jo ascertain with sufficient exactness by means of the solstitial shadows. The year is called tipantu, the departure, or course of the son, as that luminary departs, or appears to depart, from the tropic, in order to make its annual revolution : it is divided into 12 months of SO days each, as was that of the Egyptians and Persians. In order to complete the tropical year, they add five intercalary days, but in what manner they are introduced we are not able to determine ; it is, however, probable they are placed in the last month, which in that case will have 35 days. These months are called generally cujen, or moons, and must have originally been regulated wholly by the phases of the moon. The proper names of them, as near as they can be rendered by ours, are the following, which are derived from the qualities, or the most remarkable things which are produced in each month : Jvuncujen, January, The month of fruit. 
Cogicujen, February, The month of harvest. Glorcujen, March, The month of maize. 
Jiimucujen, April, The first month of the rimu. Inarimucujen, May, The second month of the rimu. Thorcujen, June, The first month of foam. 
Inanthorcvjen, July, Thesecond month offoam. Huincujeri) August, The unpleasant month. 

JPilluleujen, September, The treacherous month.  
Hueulcujcn, October, The first month of new winds. Inanhueulcujen, November, The second month of new winds. Huevirucujen, December, The month of new fruit. The seasons, as in Europe, consist of three months ; the spring is called peughen, the summer ucan, the autumn gualug, and the winter pucham. To render the distribution of the year uniform, they also divide the natural day into 12 parts, which they call gliagantu, assigning six to the day, and six to the night, in the manner of the Chinese, the Japanese, the Otaheitans, and several other nations. Thus each gliagantu, or Araucanian hour, is equal to two of ours. Those of the day they determine by the height of the sun, and those of the night by the position of the stars ; but as they make use of no instrument for this purpose, it follows that this division, which must necessarily be unequal, according to the different seasons of the year, will be much more so from the imperfect manner of regulating it. They begin to number their hours, as is general in Europe, from midnight, and give to each a particular name. In civil transactions they calculate indifferently, either by days, nights, or mornings ; so that three days, three nights, ^or three mornings, signify the same thing. 
16. Astronomical ideas.— To the stars in general they give the name of huaglen, and divide them into several constellations, which they call pal or ritha. These constellations usually receive their particular appellations from the number of remarkable stars which compose them. Thus the pleiades are called cajupal, the constellation of six ; and the antarctic cross, meleritho, the constellation of four ; as the first has six stars which are very apparent, and the last four. The milky way is called rupuepeu, the fabulous road, from a story which, like other nations, they relate of it, and which is considered as fabulous by the astronomers of the country. They are well acquainted with the planets, which they call gau, a word derived from the verb gaun, to wash ; from whence it may be inferred, that they have respecting these bodies the same opinion as the Romans, that at their setting they submerge themselves in the sea. Nor are there wanting Fontenelles among them, who believe that many of those globes are so many other earths, inhabited in the same manner as ours ; for this reason they call the sky Guenumapu, the country of heaven ; and the moon, Cui/enmapu, the country of the moon. They agree likewise with the Aristotelians, -in maintain-]  

CHILE.  [ing that the comets, called by them cheruvoe, proceed from terrestrial exhalations, inflamed in the upper regions of the air ; but they are not considered as the precursors of evil and disaster, as they have been esteemed by almost all the nations of the earth. An eclipse of the sun is called by them layanlu, and that of the moon lacujen, that is, the death of the sun or of the moon. But these expressions are merely metaphorical, as are the correspondent ones in Latin, of defectus solis aut lunce. Their opinions as to the causes of these phenomena are not known, but it lias been observed that they evince no greater alarm upon these occasions than at the most common operations of nature. Their language contains many words solely applicable to astronomical subjects, such as thoren, the late rising of the stars, and others similar, which prove that their knowledge in this respect is much greater than what is generally supposed. 
17. Measures.— Their long measures are the palm, nela ; the span, duche ; the foot, namun ; the pace, thecan ; the ell, neroeu ; and the league, tupu, which answers to the marine league, or the parasang of the Persians. Their greater distances are computed by mornings, corresponding to the day's journeys of Europe. Their liquid and dry measures are less numerous: the guampar, a quart ; the can, a pint ; and the mencu, a measure of a less quantity, serve for the first. The dry measures are the chiaigue, which contains about six pints ; and the gliepu, which is double that quantity. With regard to the speculative sciences they have very little information. Their geometrical notions are, as might be expected from an uncultivated people, very rude and confined. They have not even proper words to denote the principal figures, as the point, the line, the angle, the triangle, the square, the circle, the sphere, the cube, the cone, &amp;c. ; their language, however, is so flexible and copious, that it would be easy to form from it a vocabulary of technical words to facilitate the acquisition of the sciences to the Araucanians. 
18. Rhetoric— Notwithstanding their general ignorance, they cultivate successfully the sciences of rhetoric, poetry, and medicine, as far as these are attainable by practice and observation; for they have no books among them, nor are there any of them who know how to read or write. Neither can they be induced to learn these arts, either from their aversion to every thing that is practised by the Europeans, or from their being urged by a savage spirit to despise whatever does not belong to their country. Oratory is particularly held in  high estimation, and, as among the ancient Romans, is the high road to honour, and the management of public affairs. It is equally valued amongst the North American Indians. The eldest son of an ulraenwho is deficient in this talent, is for that sole reason excluded from the right of succession, and one of his yoxinger brothers, or the nearest relation that he has, who is an able speaker, substituted in his place. Their parents, therefore, accustom them from their childhood to speak in public, and carry them to their national assemblies, where the best orators of the country display their eloquence. From hence is derived the attention which they generally pay to speak their language correctly, and to preserve it in its purity, taking great care to avoid the introduction of any foreign Avord; in which they are so particular, that whenever a foreigner settles among them, they oblige him to relinquish his name, and take another in the Chilian language. The missionaries themselves are obliged to conform to this singular regulation, if they would obtain the public favour. These have much to endure from their excessive fastidiousness, as even while they are preaching, the audience will interrupt them, and with importunate rudeness correct the mistakes in language or pronunciation which may escape them. Many of them are well acquainted with the Spanish language, from their frequent communication with the neighbouring Spaniards. They, however, make but little use of it, none of them ever attempting to speak in Spanish in any of the assemblies or congresses that have been held between the two nations ; on which occasions they had much rather submit to the inconvenience of listening to some tiresome interpreter, than, by hearing another language, to suffer their native tongue to be degraded. The speeches of their orators resemble those of the Asiatics, or more properly those of all barbarous nations. The style is highly figurative, allegorical, elevated, and replete with peculiar phrases and expressions, that are employed only in similar compositions : from whence it is called coyagtucan, the style of parliamentary harangues. They abound with parables and apologues, which sometimes furnish the whole substance of the discourse. Their orations, hotwithstanding, contain all the essential parts required by the rules of rhetoric ; which need not excite our surprise, since the same principle of nature which led the Greeks to reduce eloquence to an art, has taught the use of it to these people. They are deficient neither ina suitable exordium, a clear narrative,a wellfounded argument,or a pathetic peroration : they commonly divide their subject^   4J4  

CHILE.   [into two or three points, which they call that/, and specify the number by saying, epu Ihoygeitamen piavin, " what I am going to say is divided into two points." They employ in their oratory several kinds of style, but the most esteemed is the rachidugun, a word equivalent to academic. 
19. J'oetr?/.— Their poets are called gempin, lords of speech. This expressive name is well applied to them, since, possessing that strong enthusiasm excited by passions undebilitated by the restraints and refinements of civil life, they follow no other rides in their compositions than the impulse of their imaginations. Of course, their poetry generally contains strong and lively images, bold figures, frequent allusions and similitudes, novel and forcible expressions, and possesses the art of moving and interesting the heart by exciting its sensibility. Every thing in it is metaphorical and animated, and allegory is, if we may use the expression, its very soul or essence. The principal subject of the songs of the Araucanians is the exploits of their heroes. Their verses are composed mostly in stanzas of eight or eleven syllables, a measure which appears most agreeable to the human ear. They are blank, but occasionally a rhyme is introduced, according to the taste or caprice of the poet. 
20. Medical skill. — The Araucanians have three kinds of physicians, the ampives, the vileus, and the machis. The ampives, a word equivalent to empirics, are the best. They employ in their cures only simples, are skilful herbalists, and have some very good ideas of the pulse, and the other diagnostics. The vileus correspond to the regular physicians. Their principal theory is, that all contagious disorders proceed from insects, an opinion held by many physicians in Europe. For this reason, they generally give to epidemics the name of culampiru, that is to say, vermiculous disorders, or diseases of worms. The machis are a superstitious class, that are to be met with among all the savage nations of both continents. They maintain that all serious disorders proceed from witchcraft, and pretend to cure them by supernatural means, for which reason they are employed in desperate cases, when the exertions of the ampives or the vileus are ineffectual. Their mode of cure is denominated machlun, and consists in the following idle ceremonies, which are always performed in the night. The room of the sick person is lighted with a great number of torches ; and in a corner of it, among several branches of laurel, is placed a large bough of cinnamon, to which is suspended the magical drum ; near it is a sheep ready for sacrifice. The machi directs the women who are pre-  sent to sing with a loud voice a doleful song, accompanied with the sound of some little drums, which they beat at the same time. In the mean while he fumigates three times with tobacco smoke the branch of cinnamon, the sheep, the singers, and the sick person. After this ceremony he kills the sheep, takes out the heart, and after sucking the blood, fixes it upon the branch of cinnamon. He next approaches the patient, and by certain charms pretends to open his belly to discover the poison which has been given him by the pretended sorcerer. He then takes the magical drum, which he beats in concert to a song sung by himself and the women, who follow him round the room in procession ; when, ail at once, he falls to the ground like a maniac, making frightful gesticulations and horrible contortions of his body, sometimes wildly opening his eyes, then shutting them, appearing like one possessed of an evil spirit. During this farcical scene, the relations of the sick interrogate the machi upon the cause of the malady. To these questions the fanatical impostor replies in such a manner as he believes best calculated to promote the deception, either by naming, as the cause of the malady, some person of whom he wishes to be revenged, or expressing himself doubtfully as io the success of his incantations. In this manner these diabolical mountebanks become very frequently the cause of horrible murders ; as the relations of the sick, supposing the accusation true, put to death without pity those accused of these practices, and sometimes involve in their revenge the whole family, should they not be strong enough to resist their violence. But these malicious fomenters of discord are careful never to accuse the principal families. The machis, though not invested with the sacerdotal character, like the physicians of most other savage nations, greatly resemble in their impostures the shamanis of Kamschatka, the molars of Africa, and the piachis of Orenoque, whose tricks are accurately described by the Abbe Giii, in his History of the Orinokians. These physicians, notwithstanding the different systems they pursue, sometimes meet to satisfy the solicitude or the vanity of the relations of the sick ; but their consultations, which are called thauman, have generally the same issueas those of the physicians of Europe. They have besides these other kinds of professors of medicine. The first, who may be styled surgeons, are skilful in replacing dislocations, in repairing fractures, and in curing wounds and ulcers : they are called gutarvt, possess real merit, and often perform wonderful cures. But this is by no means the case with the others, called cupove, from the verb cupon, to ana-J   

CHILE.  
[tomfze : these, infatuated with machiism, dissect bodies in order to show the entrails, which they say are infected with magic poison. Nevertheless, by means of this practice, they acquire ideas, by no means contemptible, respecting the conformation of the human body, for the different parts of which they have appropriate names. Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Araucanians made bleeding, blistering, clysters, emetics, cathartics, and sudorifics, all which remedies have their peculiar names in their language. They let blood with the sharp point of a flint fixed in a small stick. This instrument they prefer to a lancet, as they think it less liable to fail. Instead of a syringe they make use, like the inhabitants of Kamschatka, of a bladder, to which they apply a pipe. Their emetics, cathartics, and sudorifics, are almost all obtained from the vegetable kingdom . 
21. Commerce. — Their internal and exteral commerce is very limited: not having yet introduced among them the use of money, every thing is conducted by means of barter. This is regulated by a kind of conventional tariff, according to which all commercial articles are appraised, under the name of cutten. Thus a horse or a bridle forms one payment ; an ox two, &amp;c. Their external commerce is carried on with the Spaniards, with whom they exchange ponchos and animals for wine, or the merchandize of Europe, and their good faith in contracts of this kind has always been highly applauded. " The Spaniard," says Raynal in his history, " who engages in this trade, applies directly to the heads of families. When he has obtained the necessary permission, he proceeds to all the houses, and distributes indiscriminately his merchandize to all those who present themselves. "When he has completed his sale, he gives notice of his departure, and all the purchasers hasten to deliver to him, in the first village he arrives at, the articles agreed upon ; and never has there been an instance of the least failure of punctuality." We cannot help extracting also the following from the Compendium of the Geographical, Natural, and Civil History of Chile, printed in Bologna, 1776. " The Spaniards who live in the province of Maule, and near the frontiers of Araucania, carry on a commerce with these people, which consists in supplying them with iron ware, bits for bridles, cutlery, grain, and wine. This trade is conducted altogether by the way of barter, as it is not possible to persuade the Araucanians to open the gold mines, nor to produce any of that metal. The returns therefore are in ponchi, or Indian cloaks, of which they receive more than 40,000 an-   nually ; in horned cattle, horses, ostrich feathers, curiously wrought baskets, and other trifles of a similar kind. This commerce, although generally prohibited, is carried on in the Indian country, whither the traders go with their merchandize by byeroads, and deposit it in the cabins of the natives, to whom they readily trust whatever they wish to sell, certain of being punctually paid at the time agreed upon, which is always the case, these Indians observing the greatest faith in their contracts." 
22. National pride. — The Araucanians, proud of their valour and unbounded liberty, believe themselves the only people in the world deserving the name of men. From hence it is, that, besides the appellation ofauca, or free, which they value so highly, they give themselves metaphorically the names of che, or the nation ; of reche, pure or undegenerated nation; and of huentu, men, a word of similar signification with the vir of the Latins; and as the Latter is the root of the word virtus, so from the former is derived huentugen, which signifies the same thing. From this ridiculous pride proceeds the contempt with which they regard all other nations. To the Spaniards they gave, on their first knowledge of them, the nickname of chiapi, vile soldiers ; from whence proceeded the denomination of chiapeton, by which they are known in South America. They afterwards called them h&lt;;inca; this injurious appellation, which from time and custom has lost its odiousness, comes from the verb huincun, which signifies to assassinate. It is true that in their first battles the Spaniards gave them too much reason for applying to them these opprobrious epithets, which serve to the present time to denote one of that nation- Esteeming themselves fortunate in their barbarity, they call those Indians who live in the Spanish settlements culmehuinea, or wretched Spaniards. To the other Europeans, the English, French, and Italians, whom they readily distinguish from each I other, they give the name of maruche, which is equivalent to the term mora, used by the common people of Spain, to denote all strangers indiscriminately. They call each other pegni, that is, brothers, and even apply the same name to those born in their country of foreign parents. 
23. Kindness towards each other. — Thebenevo? lence and kindness with which these people treat each other is really surprising. For the Word ( friend, they have six or seven very expressive terms in their language ; among others, that of canay, which corresponds to the alter ego of the Latins. Those who haye the same name call each] 
-   I  CHILE.  
[other faca, and those who bear but a part of the name apellaca : these denominations incur an obligation of mutual esteem and aid. Relations by consanguinity are called in general monmague, and those of affinity quillan. Their table of genealogy is more intricate than that of the Europeans ; all the conceivable degrees of relationship being indicated therein by particular names. From the mutual affection which subsists between them, proceeds their solicitude reciprocally to assist each other in their necessities. Not a beggar or an indigent person is to be found throughout the whole Araucanian territory ; even the most infirm and most incapable of subsisting themselves are decently clothed. This benevolence is not, however, confined only to their countrymen : they conduct themselves with the greatest hospitality towards all strangers of whatever nation, and a traveller may live in any part of their country without the least expence. 
24. Mode of salutation. — Their usual expression whenever they meet is marimari ; and when they quit each other, ventempi or venteni. They are rather tiresome in their compliments, which are generally too long, as they take a pride upon such occasions, as well as every other, in making a display of their eloquence. The right hand is among them, as with the Europeans, the most honourable station, contrary to the practice of the Asiatics, with whom the left enjoys that privilege. They are naturally fond of honourable distinction, and there is nothing they can endure with less patience than contempt or inattention. From hence, if a Spaniard speaks to any one of them with his hat on, he immediately says to him in an indignant tone, entugo tarni curksia, "takeoff your hat." By attention and courtesy any thing may be obtained from them, and the favours which they receive make an indelible impression upon their minds ; while, on the contrary, ill treatment exasperates them to such a degree, that they proceed to the greatest excesses to revenge themselves. 
25. Proper names. — The names of the Araucanians are composed of the proper name, which is generally either an adjective or a numeral, and the family appellation or surname, which is always placed after the proper name, according to the European custom, as Carilemu, green bush ; Melianlu, four suns. Nor is there scarcely a material object which does not furnish them with a discriminative name. From hence, we meet among, them with the families of Rivers, Mountains, Stones, Lions, &amp;c. These families, which are called Cuja or E/pa, are more or less respected ac-  cording to their rank, or the heroes they have given to their country. The origin of these surnames is unknown, but is certainly of a period much earlier than that of the Spanish conquests. 
26. Matrimony. — By the admapu, polygamy is allowed among the Araucanians, whence they marry as many wives as they can furnish with a dower, or more properly purchase, as to obtain them they must give to their fathers a certain amount of property, as has been, and still is, the practice in most countries of both continents. But in their marriages they scrupulously avoid the more immediate degrees of relationship. Celibacy is considered as ignominious. Old bachelors are called by way of contempt vuchiapra, and old maids cudepra, that is, old, Idle, good for nothing. Their marriage* ceremonies have little formality, or, to speak more accurately, consist in nothing more than in carrying off the bride by pretended violence ; which is considered by them, as by the Negroes of Africa, an essential prerequiste to the nuptials. The husband, in concert with the father, conceals himself with some friends near the place where they know the bride is to pass. As soon as she arrives, she is seized and put on horseback behind the bridegroom, notwithstanding her pretended resistance and her shrieks, which are far from being serious. In this manner she is conducted with much noise to the house of her husband, where her relations are assembled, and where they receive the presents agreed upon, after having partaken of the nuptial entertainment. Of course, the expences of an Araucanian wedding are by no means inconsiderable ; from whence it happens that the rich alone can maintain any considerable number of wives. The poor content themselves with one, or two at most. Nor does there arise any inconvenience from the scarcity of women, as the number of females is much greater than that of males, which is, however doubtful, said to be the case in those countries where polygamy is permitted. The first wife, who is called unendomo, is always respected as the real and legitimate one by all the others, who are called inandomo, or secondary wives. She has the management of the domestic concerns, and regulates the interior of the house. The husband has much to do to maintain harmony among so many women, who are not a little inclined to jealousy; and each night, at supper, makes known his choice of her who is to have the honour of sharing his bed, by directing her to prepare it. The others sleep in the same room, and no one is permitted to approach them. Strangers, on their arrival, are lodged in a cabin entirely separate from]  

CHILE.  f this seraglio. The wives have the greatest respect For their husbands, and generally give him the title of buta, or great. Besides female occupations, they • are obliged to employ themselves in many which in civilized countries are considered as the peculiar province of the men, according to the established maxim of all barbarous nations, that the weaker sex arc born to labour, and the stronger to make war and to command. Each of them is obliged to present to her husband daily a dish prepared-, by herself in her separate kitchen or fireplace ; for this reason the liouses of the Araucanians have as many fires as there are women inhabiting them; whence, in inquiring of any one how many wives he has, they make use of the following phrase, as being the most polite, muri onthalgeimi, " how many fires do you keep." Each wife is also obliged to furnish her husband yearly, besides his necessary clothing, with one of those cloaks already described, called ponchos, which form one of the principal branches of the Araucanian commerce. 
26. Domestic employments. — The greatest attention is paid by the women to the cleanliness of their houses, which they sweep, as well as their courts, several times in the course of a day ; and •whenever they make use of any utensil they immediately wash it ; their houses being so situated as to be always readily supplied with an abundance of running water. The same attention to cleanliness is paid with regard to their persons : they comb their heads twice a day, and once a week wash them with a soap made from the bark of the quillai, which keeps the hair very clean, and which is also much used by the Spaniards, especially those who live in the country. There is never to be seen a spot of dirt on the clothes of an Arauxanian woman. The men are likewise equally fond of cleanliness ; they never fail to comb their heads every day, and are alsoaccustomed frequently to wash them. Bathing, as among the ancients, is in common use with these people, who think it necessary for the sake of preserving their health and of strengthening their bodies; and in order to have it convenient, "they are careful to place their houses on the banks of rivers. In warm weather they bathe themselves several times a day, and it is rare, even in winter, that they do not bathe ihemsel/es at least once a day : by means of this continued exercise they become excellent swimmers, and give wonderful proofs of dexterity in this art. They will swim for a great distance under water, and in this manner cross their largest rivers, which renders them some of the best divers in the world. The women are also fond of freTOL. I.  quent bathing, and for this purpose select the most obscure solitary places, at a great distance from the men. Even on the very day of the birth of a child, they take the infant to the river and wash it, and also themselves, and within a short time return to their customary avocations, without experiencing any inconvenience ; so true it is, that the human constitution is not naturally delicate, but is rendered. so by our customs and living. Childbirth is with them attended with little pain ; which must be attributed to the strength of their constitutions ; for a similar reason, the women of the lower classes in Europe, according to the statement of Doctor Bland, in the Philosophical Transactions, experience a more easy delivery than the ladies^ and are less subject to sickness in consequence. Whether directed by an impulse of simple nature, or actuated by their solicitude to furnish strong men to the state, they rear their children in a very different manner from what is practised in civilized countries. When they have washed them in running water, as has been already observed, they neither swathe nor bandage them, but place them in a hanging cradle, called chigua, lined with soft skins, where they merely cover them with a cloth, and swing them from time to time by means of acord attached to the cradle, which leaves them more at liberty to attend to their domestic concerns. When their children begin to walk, which is very soon, they neither put them into stays, nor any other confined dress, but keep them loosely clad, and let them go anywhere, and eat what they please. Formed thus, as it were, by themselves, they become well shaped and robust, and less subject to those infirmities that are the consequence of a tender and a delicate education. Indeed, the maladies which prevail among the Araucanians are but few, and are for the most part reducible to inflammatory fevers, originating either from intemperance in drinking, or to the excessive exercise which they sometimes use. If the physical education of the Araucanian children is in a certain degree laudable, the moral education which they receive will not certainly meet with our entire approbation. It is, nevertheless, conformable to the ideas of that highminded people respecting the innate liberty of man, and such as may be expected from an uncivilized nation. Their fathers are satisfied in insructing them in the use of arms, and the management of horses, and in teaching them to speak their native language with elegance. In other respects they leave them to do whatever they please, and praise them whenever they see them insolent, saying, that in this manner they learn to become men. It is very unusual for therol 3n  CHILE.  
[to chastise or correct them, as they hold it as an established truth, that chastisement only renders men base and cowardly. 
27. Food. — The usual diet of the Araucanians is very simple ; their principal subsistence is several kinds of grain and pulse, which they prepare in a variety of different modes. They are particularly fond of maize, or Indian corn, and potatoes; of the last they have cultivated more than SO different kinds from time immemorial, esteeming them a very healthy nutriment. Although they have large and small animals and birds in plenty, yet they eat but little flesh, and that is simply boiled or roasted. They have the same abstemiousness in the use of pork, from which they know very well how to prepare black puddings and sausages. Their seas and rivers abound with excellent fish, but they do not much esteem this kind of aliment. Instead of bread, which they are not accustomed to eat, except at their entertainments, they make use of small cakes of maize or roasted potatoes with a little salt. Their usual drinks consist of various kinds of beer, and of cider made from Indian corn, from apples, and other fruits of the country. They nevertheless are extremely fond of wine, which they purchase from the Spaniards, but hitherto, either for political reasons, or more probably from carelessness, they have paid no attention to the raising of vines, which, as has been proved by experiment, produce very well in all their provinces. The master of the house eats at the same table with the rest of his family. The plates are earthen, of their own manufactory, and the spoons and cups are made of horn or wood. The ulmenes have in general wrought plate for the service of their tables, but they only make use of it when they entertain some stranger of rank : upon such occasions they ostentatiously display it, being naturally fond of show, and of being considered rich. Their seasonings are made of Guineapepper, of madi, and salt. In summer they are fond of dining in the shade of trees, which for this purpose are always planted around their houses. They do not use the flint for the purpose of obtaining fire, but employ, like the Kamschatdales, two pieces of dry wood, one of which they place upon another, and turn it in their hands until it takes fire, which is very soon. Besides dinner, supper, and breakfast, they have every day without fail their luncheon, which consists of a little flour of parched corn, steeped in hot water in the morning, and in cold in the evening. But they often deviate from this simple mode of living when at their public entertainments, which they give each other on occasion of funerals, marriages, or any other important  event. At such times no expence is spared, and they are profuse of every thing that can promote festivity. In one of these banquets, at which it is common for 300 persons to be present, more meat, grain, and liquor is consumed, than would be sufficient to support a whole family for two years. It is usual for one of these feasts to continue two or three days : they are called cahuhi, or circles, from the company seating themselves in a circle around a large branch of cinnamon. Such entertainments are made gratuitously, and any person whatever is permitted to partake of them without the least expence. But this is not the case with the mingacos, or those dinners which they are accustomed to make on occasion of cultivating their land, threshing their grain, building a house, or any other work which requires the combined aid of several. At such times all those who wish to partake in the feast, must labour until the work is completed. But as these people have abundant leisure, the labourers collect in such numbers, that in a very few hours the work is finished, and the rest of the day is devoted to feasting and drinking. The Spaniards who live in the country have also adopted a similar plan, availing themselves of the same kind of industry to complete their rural labours. Fermented liquors, in the opinion of the Araucanians, form the principal requisites of an entertainment; for whenever they are not in plenty, whatever may be the quantity of provisions, they manifest great dissatisfaction, exclaiming golingelai, " it is a wretched feast, there is no drink." These bacchanalian revels succeed each other almost without interruption throughout the year, as every man of property is ambitious of the honour of giving them; so that it may be .said, that the Araucanians, when not engaged in war, pass the greater part of their lives in revelry and amusement. 
28. Music and other diversions. — Music, dancing, and play, form their customary diversions. As to the first, it scarcely deserves the name ; not so much from the imperfection of the instruments, which are the same they make use of in war, but from their manner of singing, which has something in it harsh and disagreeable to the ear, until one has been accustomed to it for a long time. They have several kinds of dauces, which are lively and pleasing, and possess considerable variety. The women are rarely permitted to dance with the men, but form their companies apart, and dance to the sound of the same instruments. If what the celebrated Leibnitz asserts is true, that men have never dicovered greater talents than in the invention of the different kinds of games, the]  

CHILE.  [Araucanians may justly claim the merit of not being in this respect inferior to other nations. Their games are very numerous, and for the most part very ingenious ; they are divided into the sedentary and gymnastic. It is a curious fact, and worthy of notice, that among the first is the game of chess, which they call comican, and which has been known to them from time immemorial. The game of quechu, which they esteem highly, has a great affinity to that of back -gammon ; but instead of dice they make use of triangular pieces of bone marked with points, which they throw with a little hoop or circle, supported by two pegs, as was probably the fritillus of the Romans. The youth exercise themselves frequently in wrestling and running. They are fond of playing at ball, which is made from a species of rush, and called pilma. All their gymnsatic games, many of which resemble those of tiie European youth, require strength, are well suited to their genius, and for the most part serve as an image of war. What has been said of the Araucanians does not altogether apply to the Puelches, or inhabitants of the fourth uthalmapu, situated in the Andes. These, although they conform to the general custom of the nation, always discover a great degree of rudeness and savageness of manners. Their name signifies easternmen. They are of lofty stature, and are fond of hunting, which induces them frequently to change their habitations, and extend their settlements, not only to the eastern skirts of the Andes, but even to the borders of the lake Naguelguapi, and to the extensive plains of Patagonia, on the shores of the Atlantic. The Araucanians hold these mountaineers in high estimation for the important services which they occasionally render them, and for the fidelity which they have ever observed in their alliance with them. 
Chap. IV. 
The wars of the Araucanians with the Spaniards, and concomitant events. Sect. I. Comprising a period of nine years, from 1550 to 1559. I. The Toqui Aillavila. — It was in the year 1550, that the Araucanians, having resolved to send succours to the inhabitants of Penco, who were at that time invaded by the Spaniards, gave orders to the Toqui Aillavila to march immediately to their assistance at the head of 4000 men : he accordingly passed the great river Biobio, which separates the Araucanian territory from that of the Pencones, and boldly offered battle to these new enemies, who had advanced to meet him to the shores of the Andalien. After the first discharge  of musketry, which the Araucanians sustained without being terrified or disconcerted, thus early manifesting how little they would regard it when rendered familiar by habit, Aillavila, with a rapid movement, fell at once upon the front and flanks of the Spanish army. The Spaniards were consequently thrown into much disorder, and their general was exposed to imminent danger, having had his horse killed under him, when Aillavila, hurried forwards by a rash courage, received a mortal wound. The Araucanians having lost their general, with many of their most valiant officers, then retired, but in good order, leaving the field to the Spaniards, who had no disposition to pursue them. Valclivia, who had been in many battles in Europe as well as America, declared that he had never been exposed to such imminent hazard of his life as in this engagement. 
2. The Toqui Lincoyan. — In the following year the Araucanians were again led on to the attack by a new toqui, Lincoyan; when such was the terror inspired by their approach, that the Spaniards, after confessing themselves, and partaking of the sacrament, thought proper to take shelter under the cannon of their fortifications. The event of this battle was the cause of the foundation of the chapel dedicated to St. James, which chapel was built by the Spanish soldiers from sentiments of gratitude, and from their supposition that the retreat of Lincoyan, who was unsuccessful in his first attack, was caused by the supernatural agency of the apostle St. James himself, whom they declared to have seen riding upon a white horse with a flaming sword, and striking terror into his enemies. The governor, after the elapse of nearly a year, resolved to attack them with a reinforcement he bad just received from Peru : he accordingly, unobstructed by the tardy operations of Lincoyan, bent his way towards the shores of the Cauten, which divides the Araucanian territory into two nearly equal parts. 
3. Imperial founded. — At the confluence of this river and that of Damas, he founded the city of Imperial, so called in honour of the Emperor Charles the Fifth, or, as it is said by some, in consequence of finding there eagles with two heads cut in wood, and placed as ornaments upon the tops of houses. This city was situated in a beautiful spot, abounding with every convenience of life; and during the short period of its existence became the most flourishing Of any in Chile. Its position on the shore of a large river, of sufficient depth for vessels to lie close to the walls, rendered it a highly advantageous situation for commerce, and would enable it to obtain immediate succour] 
3 h 2  CHILE.  
[in case of a siege. Modern geographers speak of it as a city not only existing in the present time, but as very stongly fortified, and the seat of a bishopric, when it has been buried in ruins for more than 200 years. 
4. Villaric a founded. — About the same time he dispatched Alderete, one of his officers, with 60 men, to form a settlement on the shore of the great lake JLauquen, to which he gave the name of Villarica, from the great quantity of gold that he found in its environs. In the mean time, having received fresh reinforcements, he commenced his march towards the s. still kept in view by Lincoyan, whom timid caution constantly prevented from offering himself to his enemy. 
5. The Clinches. — In this manner the Spanish commander traversed, with little loss, the whole of Araucania from n. to s. ; but at his arrival at the Calacalht, which separates the Araucanians from the Cunches, he found the latter in arms determined to oppose his passage. While he was deliberating what measures to pursue, a woman of the country, called Hecloma, had the address to persuade the Cunchese general to favour the strangers ; and without foreseeing the consequences, be permitted them to pass unmolested. The Cunches form one of the most valiant nations of Chile: they inhabit that tract of country which lies upon the sea, between the river Calacalla, at present called Valdivia, and the Archipelago of Chiloe. They are the allies of the Araucanians, and mortal enemies to the Spaniards, and are divided into several tribes, which, like those in the other parts of Chile, are governed by their respective ulmene's. 
6. Valdivia founded. — The Spanish commander having passed the river with his troops, founded upon the southern shore the sixth city, called Valdivia, being the first of the American conquerors who sought in this manner to perpetuate his family name. This settlement, of which at present only the fortress remains, in a few years attained a considerable degree of celebrity, not only from the superior fineness of the gold dug in its mines, which obtained it the privilege of a mint, but from the excellence of its harbour, one of the most secure and pleasant in the S. sea. The river is very broad, and so deep, that ships of the line may anchor within a few feet of the shore ; it also forms several other harbours in the vicinity. 
7. Fortresses, of Puren^ Tucapel, and Arauco built. — Valdivia, satisfied with the conquests, or rather incursions, that he had made, turned back, and in repassing the provinces of Puren, Tucapel,  and Arauco, built in each of them, in 1553, a fortress, to secure the possession of the others ; as he well knew that from these provinces alone he had to apprehend any attempt that might prove fatal to his settlements. Ercilla says, that in this expedition the Spaniards had to sustain many battles with the natives; which is highly probable, as the continuance of Lincoyan in command can on no other principle be accounted for. Without re- Meeting upon the imprudence of occupying so large an extent of country with so small a force, Valdivia had the farther rashness, on his return to Santiago, to dispatch Francis de Aguirre, with 200 men, to conquer the provinces of Cujo and Tucuman, situated to the e. of the Andes. 
8. City of the Frontiers founded. — The Spanish general, indefatigable in his plans of conquest, returned also himself to Araucania ; and in the province of Encol founded the seventh and last city, in a country fertile in vines, and gave it the name of the City of the Frontiers. This name, from events which could not possibly have been in the calculation of Valdivia, has become strictly applicable to its present state, as its ruins are, in reality, situated upon the confines of the Spanish settlement in that part of Chile. It was a rich and commercial city, and its wines were transported to Buenos Ay res by a road over the Cordilleras. 
9. Three principal military offices instituted at Concepcion. — After having made suitable provisions for this colony, Valdivia returned to his favourite city of Concepcion, where he instituted the three principal military offices ; that of quartermastergeneral, of serjeantmajor, and of commissary ; a regulation which has, till within a few years, prevailed in the royal army of Chile. At present only two of these offices exist ; that of the quartermastergeneral, who is also called the intendant, and resides in the city of Concepcion, and that of the serjeantmajor. 
10. The Toqui Caupolican. — The next toqui who distinguished himself in the Araucanian wars, and who succeeded Lincoyan in command, was Caupolican ; he evinced a spirit of much enterprise and cunning, and succeeded in driving the Spaniards from the forts of Arauco and Tucapel, which were by his orders completely destroyed. In a succeeding battle we find this commander, from the loss of a number of his men, flying in confusion before the Spanish artillery, and suffering all the horror and disgrace attendant upon an apparent defeat, when, in a momentous crisis, a young Araucanian, called Lautaro, whom Valdivia in one of his incursions had taken prisoner,}   CHILE.  [baptized, and made his page, instigated by shame for his countrymen, quitted the victorious party, and by encouragement and entreaties prevailed upon the Araucanians to return to the conflict. Thus was changed llie fate of the day : of the Spanish army only two Promaucians had the fortune to escape: and this may be considered an epoch in the history of Araucanian valour, not only from the event of the battle itself, but as being the dawn of that glory which ever after signalized the armies of that nation under the happy auspices of the Araucanian Hannibal, the great and valiant Lautaro. 
. 11. Valdivia slain ; Lautaro appointed lieutenantgeneral. — After the death of Valdivia, who was taken prisoner in the battle, and dispatched by an old ulmen whilst pleading for his life in an assembly of ulraenes, the young Lautaro was appointed lieutenantgeneral extraordinary to Caupolican, with the privilege of commanding in chief another army, which he intended to raise to protect the frontiers from the invasion of the Spaniards. In the mean time the Spanish inhabitants of the City of the Frontiers and of Puren, thinking themselves insecure within their walls, retired to Imperial. The same was the case of those of Villarica, who abandoned their houses, and took refuge in Valdivia. Thus had the Araucanians only these two places to attack. Caupolican having determined to besiege them, committed to Lautaro the care of defending the in frontier. 
12, The mountain Mariguenu. — The young vicetoqui fortified himself upon the lofty mountain of Mariguenu, situated on the road which leads to the province of Arauco, supposing, as it happened, that the Spaniards, desirous of revenging the death of their general, would take that road in search of Caupolican. This mountain, which on several occasions has proved fatal to the Spaniards, has on its summit a large plain interspersed with shady trees. Its sides are full of clefts and precipices ; on the part towards the w. the sea beats with great violence, and the e. is secured by impenetrable thickets. A winding byepath on the n. was the only road that led to the summit of the mountain. 
13. The Governor Villagran. — Villagran, who had succeeded Valdivia in the government, was not able to cope with the valour and military prowess of Lautaro. Without entering into particulars of a desperate battle which was fought between these two commanders, we shall content ourselves with observing, that the result was the immediate evacuation of Concepcion ; as Villagran, thinking it  impossible to defend that city, embarked precipitately the old men, the women, and children, on board of two ships which were then fortunately in the harbour, with orders to the captains to conduct part of them to Imperial, and part to Valparaiso ; while with the rest of the inhabitants he proceeded by land to Santiago. 
14. Concepcion destroyed. — Lautaro, on entering the deserted city, found in it a very great booty, as its commerce and mines had rendered it very opulent ; and the citizens, more attentive to save their lives than their riches, had, on their departure, taken scarcely any thing with them except a ftw provisions. After having burned the houses, and razed the citadel to its foundation, the victor returned with his army to celebrate his triumph in Arauco. But although Lautaro was thus successful, Caupolican was obliged to raise the siege of Imperial and Valdivia; these places having had strong reinforcements thrown into them by Villagran. 
15. The smallpox appears. — It was at this awful period, when he, availing himself of the absence of his enemy, was ravaging the country in the vicinity of Imperial, and burning the houses and crops, that the Araucanians were visited by that baneful enemy of mankind, the smallpox, supposed to have been communicated by some of the Spanish soldiers, who were either infected at the time, or who had but recently recovered from it. It made the greatest ravages ; and we hear that of the several districts of the country there was one whose population amounted to 12,000 persons, of which number not more than 100 escaped with life. This pestilential disorder had, to be sure, already made its appearance a few years before in some of the n. provinces, but those of the s. had been for more than a century exempt from its ravages, from the precautions employed by the inhabitants to prevent all communication with the infected countries. Whilst Villagran was employing all his attention in maintaining, as far as possible, the Spanish power, his attention was drawn off to the claims of Francis Aguirre, who, in Valdivia's instructions, had been named the second as governor ; and who, on learning the death of that general, determined to possess himself of the government either by favour or force. 
16. Decision of the audience of Lima respecting the governors. — His pretensions must infallibly have produced a civil war between Villagran and himself, had they not both consented to submit their claims to the decision of the royal audience of Lima. This court, whose jurisdiction at that]  CHILE.  
[time (1555) extended over the whole of S. America, did not think proper to commit the government to either, but in tbeir place directed that the corregidors of the city should have the command, each in his respective district, until further orders. 
17. Conception rebuilt, and destroyed by Laittaro. — Upon a remonstrance of the inhabitants to the court of audience, Villagran was afterwards appointed to the command, but merely, however, with the title of corregidor, receiving orders at the same time to rebuild the city of Concepcion. No sooner was this order executed, than the young Lautaro rallied his army, and, exasperated against what he termed " obstinacy," passed the Biobio without delay, and attacked the Spaniards, who imprudently confiding in their valour, awaited him in the open plain. The first encounter decided Ihefate of the battle. The Araucanians entered the fort with those citizens who fled with precipitation, and killed a great number of them ; some indeed embarked in a ship which was in the port, and others fled into the woods. Thus Lautaro, having plundered and burned the city as before,- returned laden with spoils to his wonted station. Continued victories had so heightened the confidence of this commander, that nothing appeared to him impossible, and he formed the determination of attacking the Spaniards in their vejy capital, of carrying his arms against Santiago itself. He accordingly passed with a chosen band of 600 followers through the country of the Promaucians, where his indignation did not fail to vent itself upon these people ; a people detested by him for having submitted to the Spanish yoke. The inhabitants of Santiago could not at first believe it possible that he should have had the boldness to undertake a journey of 300 miles in order to attack them ; but being undeceived as to the fact, thought proper to make some preparations of defence. 
18. Lautaro arrives at Santiago. — Lautaro had now encamped his army in a low meadow, on the shore of the Matiquito ; a measure he had been obliged to adopt from repeated loss he had sustained in some skirmishes with young Villagran, who had taken the command on account of his father being confined by sickness ; but the father having recovered his health, and being strongly solicited by the citizens, who every moment expected to see the Araucanians at their gates, at length, in 1556, began his march with 1,96 Spaniards, and 1000 auxiliaries, in search of Lautaro; but too well remembering the defeat of Marisruenu, he resolved to attack him by surprise. With this  intent he quitted the great road, secretly directed his march by the seashore, and under the guidance of a spy, by a private path, came at daybreak upon the Araucanian encampment. ' 
19. Death of Lautaro. — Lautaro, who at that moment had retired to rest, after having been upon guard, as was his custom during the night, leaped from his bed at the fast alarm of the sentinels, and ran to the entrenchments to observe the enemy ; at this moment a dart, hurled by one of the Indian auxiliaries, pierced his heart, and he fell lifeless in the arms of his companions. It would seem that fortune, hitherto propitious, was desirous by so sudden a death to save him from the mortification of finding himself, for the first time in his life, defeated. It is, however, not improbable that his genius, so fertile in expedients, would have suggested to him some plan to have baffled the attempts of the assailants, if this fatal accident had not occurred. Encouraged by this unexpected success, Villagran attacked the fortifications on all sides, and forced an entrance, notwithstanding the obstinate resistance of the Araucanians, who, retiring to an angle of the works, determined rather to be cut to pieces than to surrender themselves to those who had slain their beloved general. In vain the Spanish commander repeated lyofl'ered them quarter ; none of them accepted it, excepting a few of the neighbouring Indians who happened to be in their camp. The Araucanians perished to a man, after having fought with such obstinacy, that a few of the last sought their death by throwing themselves on the lances of their enemies. This victory, which was not obtained without great loss by the victors, was celebrated for three days in succession in Santiago, and in all the other Spanish settlements, with the utmost demonstrations of joy. The Spaniards felicitated themselves on being at last freed from an enemy, who at the early age of 19 had already obtained so many victories over their nation, and who possessed talents capable of entirely destroying their establishments in Chile, and even harassing them in Peru, as he had resolved upon, when he had restored the liberty of his native country. The Araucanians for a long time lamented the loss of their valiant countryman, to whom they owed all the success of their arms, and on whose conduct and valour they entirely relied for the recovery of their liberties. His name is still celebrated in their heroic songs, and his actions proposed as the most glorious model for the imitation of their youth. 
20. Caupolican raises tlie siege of Imperial.— But above all, Caupolican felt this fatal loss; as he was a sincere lover of his country, far from]   CHILE.  [thinking he had freed himself from a rival, he believed he had lost his chief cooperator in the glorious work of restoring his country. As soon as he received the mournful news, he quitted the siege of Imperial, which was reduced to the last extremity, and returned with his army to the frontiers to protect them from the incursions of the enemy. 
21. The Governor Don Garcia JIurtado de 3tendoza.— The next person this general had to encounter, proved more formidable than any of the former Spanish chiefs; it was Don Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza, who was appointed to the government by his father, the Marquis of Cailete, viceroy of Peru. 
22. Catipolican taken prisoner and impaled.— He took possession of the island of Quriquina, and during his stay there, which was almost the whole winter, he did not fail to send embassies to the Araucanians, expressing the wish of coming to an amicable accommodation ; but they were not inclined to listen to any proposals, and on the 6th of August military operations again commenced, and the result of several battles which were fought on this occasion was, that the Araucanians were generally defeated, and that they eventually lost their leader Caupolican, who being taken prisoner by the Spaniards was, by the command of Don Garcia, and with the entire disapprobation of the Spanish army, put to an ignominious death. 
23. Cane! e founded. — -But it should be remarked, that the Spauish general having proceeded in his marches to the province of Tucapel, and having come to the place where Valdivia had been defeated, built there, in contempt of his conquerors, a city which he called Canete, from the titular appellation of his family ; and that, considering the Araucanian war as already terminated, he gave orders for the rebuilding of the city of Concepcion. 
24. The Clinches, their curious embassy and stratagem.'— It was in 1558 that the above commander first marched with a numerous body of troops against the Cunches, a people who had not yet been opposed to the Spanish arms. These, when they first heard of the arrival of the strangers, met to deliberate whether they should submit, or resist their victorious forces ; and an Araucanian exile, called Tunconobal, who was present at the assembly, and who was desired to give his opinion upon the measures proposed, replied in the following terms : " Be cautious how you adopt either of these measures ; as vassals you will be despised, and compelled to labour ; as enemies, you will be exterminated. If you wish to free your-  selves of these dangerous visitors, make them believe you are miserably poor ; hide your property, particularly your gold ; they will not remain where they have no expectation of finding that sole object of their wishes ; send them such a present as will impress them with an idea of your poverty, and in the mean time retire to the woods." The Cunches approved the wise counsel of the Araucanian, and commissioned him, with nine natives of the country, to carry the present which he had recommended to the Spanish general. Accordingly, clothing himself and companions in wretched rags, he appeared with every mark of fear before that officer, and after complimenting him, in rude terms, presented him a basket containing some roasted lizards and wild fruits. The Spaniards, who could not refrain from laughter at the appearance of the ambassadors and their presents, began to dissuade the governor from pursuing an expedition which, from all appearances, would prove unproductive. But although he was persuaded that these people were poor and wretched, yet, lest he should discover too great facility in relinquishing his plan, he exhorted his troops to prosecute the expedition he had undertaken, assuring them, that further on, according to the information he had received, they would find a country that abounded in all the metals. Having therefore inquired of the Cunches the best road to the s. Tunconobal directed him towards the w. which was the most rough and mountainous; and the same, being applied to for a guide, gave him. one of his companions, whom he charged to conduct the army by the most desolate and difficult roads of the coast. The guide pursued so strictly the instruction of the Araucanian, that the Spaniards;, who in their pursuit of conquest were accustomed to surmount with ease the severest fatigues, acknowledged that they had never before, in any of their marches, encountered difficulties comparable with these. 
25. Archipelago of Chiloe discovered.— Having at length overcome all obstacles, they came to the top of a high mountain, from whence they discovered the great Archipelago of Anced, more commonly called Chiloe, whose channels were covered with a great number of boats navigated with sails and oars. From these islanders the Spaniards experienced every mark of politeness and humanity, and constantly regaled by them, they coasted the Archipelago to the bay of Reloncavi, when some went over to the neighbouring islands, where they found land well cultivated, and women employed in spinning wool mixed with feathers of sea birds, with which they made their clothes.]   424  

CHILE.  
[The celebrated poet Ercilla was one of the party, and solicitous of the reputation of having proceeded further s. than any other European, he crossed the gulf, and upon the opposite shore inscribed on the bark of a tree some verses containinghis name, and the time of the discovery, the 31st January 1559. 
26. City of Osorno founded. — Don Garcia satisfied with having been the first to discover by land the Archipelago ofChiloe, returned, taking for his guide one of those islanders, who conducted him safely to Imperial through the country of the Huilliches, which is for the most part level, a: d abounds in provisions. The inhabitants, who are similar in every respect to their western neighbours the Cunches, made no opposition to his passage. He there founded, or, according to some writers, rebuilt the city of Osorno, which increased rapidly, not less from its manufactures of woollen and linen stuff's, than from the fine gold procured from its mines, which were afterwards destroyed by the Toqui Paillamacu. 
Sect. II. Comprising a period of 27 years ', from 1559 to 1586. 
27. Coupolican II. — The campaign of the following year was rendered still more memorable by the numerous battles that were fought between the two armies ; that of the Araucanians was commanded by Caupolican, the eldest son of the general of that name ; but though he possessed the celebrated talents of his father, he was not equally successful in defeating his enemy. But of all his contests, that of Quipeo was the most unfortunate ; for here he lost all his most valiant officers, and being pursued by a detachment of Spanish horse, he slew himself to avoid the melancholy fate of his father. 
28. The Guarpes subjected. — Don Garcia, considering this battle decisive in every point of view, and finding himself provided with a good number of veteran troops, sent a part of them, under the command of Pedro Castillo, to complete the conquest of Cujo, which had been commenced by Francis de Aguirre. That prudent officer subjected the Guarpes, the ancient inhabitants of that province, to the Spanish government. 
29. St. Juan and Mendoza founded.— -He founded on the e. limits of the Andes two cities, one of which he called Jt. Juan, and the other Mendoza, from the family name of the governor. This extensive and fertile country remained for a considerable time under the government of Chile, but has since been transferred to the viceroyalty of Buenos Ayres, to which, from its natural situation, it ap-  pertains. Whilst in this manner Don Garcia took advantage of the apparent calm that prevailed in the country, he heard of the arrival at Buenos Ayres of the person appointed his successor by the court of Spain. In consequence of this information, confiding the government for the present to Rodrigode Quiroga, he returned to Peru, where, as a reward for his services, he was promoted to the exalted station which his father had filled. 
50. Villagran reinstated.— The governor appointed in place of Don Garcia was his predecessor, Francis Villagran, who having gone to Europe after he had been deprived of the government, procured his reinstatement therein from the court of Spain. On his arrival at Chile, supposing, from the information of Don Garcia and Quiroga, that nothing more was necessary to be done with the Araucanians, and that they were in no condition to give him trouble, Villagran turned his attention to the reacquisition of the province of Tucuman, which, after having been by him, in 1549, subjected to the government of Chile, had been since attached to the viceroyalty of Peru. 
51. The province of Tucuman restored, after" wards retaken.—- Gregori Castaneda, who had the charge of this enterprise, defeated the Peruvian commander, Juan Zurita, the author of the dismemberment, and restored the country to the obedience of the captainsgeneral of Chile ; it was, however, retained under their government but a short time, as they were obliged by the court of Spain, before the close of the century, to cede it again to the government of Peru. But neither Don Garcia nor Quiroga, notwithstanding the long time they had fought in Chile, had formed a correct opinion of the temper of the people whom they pretended they had conquered. The invincible Araucanian cannot be made to submit to the bitterest reverses of fortune. The few ulmenes who had escaped from the late defeats, more than ever determined to continue the war, assembled, immediately after the rout of Quipeo, in a wood, where they unanimously elected as toqui an officer of inferior rank, called Antiguenu, who had signalized himself in the last battle. He, with a few soldiers, retired to the inaccessible marches of Lumaco, called by the Spaniards the Rochela, Avheie he caused high scaffolds to be erected to secure his men from the extreme moisture of this gloomy retreat. The youth, who were from time to time enlisted, went thither to be instructed in the science of arms, and the Araucanians still considered themselves free, since they had a toqui. 
32. Canete destroyed. — Antiguenu began now to make incursions in the Spanish territory, in]   m  
■■  

CHILE.  
[order to practise his troops, and subsist them at the expence of the enemy ; and after defeating one of Villagran's sons, who, with a large force, came to give him battle, he marched against Cafiete ; but Villagran, convinced of the imposibiiity of defending it, anticipated him by withdrawing all the inhabitants, part of whom retired to Imperial, and part to Concepcion. The Araucanians, on their arrival, did not fail to destroy this city ; they set it on fire, aud in a short time it was entirely consumed. 
33. Pedro Villagran.— In the mean time Villagran, more the victim of grief and mental anxiety than of his disorder, died, universally regretted by the colonists, who lost in him a wise, humane, and valiant commander, to whose prudent conduct they had beea^indebted for the preservation of their conquests. Before his death he appointed as his successor, by a special commission from the court, his eldest son Pedro, whose mental endowments were no way inferior to his father's. The death of the governor appeared to Antiguenu to present a favourable opportunity to undertake some important enterprise. Having formed his array, which consisted of 4000 men, into two divisions, he ordered one, under the command of his vicetoqui, to lay siege to Concepcion, in order to attract thither the attention of the Spaniards, while with the other he marched against the fort of Arauco. The siege was protracted to a considerable length ; the commanders therefore determined to settle the affair by single combat ; but after having fought, with the greatest obstinacy for the space of two hours, they were separated by their men. But what force had not been able to effect, was performed by famine. Several boats loaded with provisions had repeatedly attempted in vain to relieve the besieged: the vigilance of the besiegers opposed so insuperable an obstacle, that Bernal, the commander, saw himself at length compelled to abandon the place. The Araucanians permitted the garrison to retire without molestation, and contented themselves with burning the houses and demolishing the walls. The capture of Angol, after that of Cafiete and Arauco, appeared easy to Antiguenu, but the attempt cost him his life ; for after the most brilliant feats of valour and intrepidity, he was forced along with a crowd of soldiers who fled, and, falling from a high bank into a river, Avas drowned. 
34. The Toqui Paillataru — Antiguenu had for successor in the toquiate Paillataru," the brother or cousin of the celebrated Lautaro. During the same time a change was made of the Spanish governor. Rodrigo de Quiroga, who had been appointed to that office by the royal audience of Lima, began his administration by arresting his predecessor, and sending him prisoner to Peru. Having received a reinforcement of 300 soldiers in 1665, he entered the Araucanian territory, rebuilt the fort of Arauco, and the city of Cafiete, constructed a new fortress at the celebrated post of Quippo, and ravaged the neighbouring provinces. Towards the end of the following year he sent the Marshal Ruiz Gamboa with CO men to subject the inhabitants of the Archipelago of Chiloe ; that officer encountered no resistance, and founded in the principal island the city of Castro and the port of Chacao. 
35. Archipelago of Chiloe subjected; description of the same, its^ inhabitants, &amp;c. — The islands of the Archipelago amount to 80, and have to all appearance been produced by earthquakes, owing to the great number of volcanoes, with which that country formerly abounded. Every part of them exhibits the most unquestionable marks of fire. Several mountains in the great island of Chiloe, which has given its name to the Archipelago, are composed of basaltic columns, which some authors strongly urge could have been produced only by the operation of fire. The native inhabitants, though descended from the continental Chilians, as their appearance, their manners, and their language all evince, are nevertheless of a very different character, being of a pacific, or rather a timid disposition. They made no opposition, as we have already observed, to the handful of Spaniards who came there to subjugate them, although their population is said to have exceeded 70,000 ; nor have they ever attempted to shake oflj the yoke until the beginning of the last century, when an insurrection of no great importance was excited, and soon quelled. The number of inhabitants at present amounts to upwards of 11,000; they are divided into 76 districts or ulmenates, the greater part of which are subject to the Spanish commanders, and are obliged to render personal service for fifty days in the year, according to the feudal laws, which are rigidly observed in this province, notwithstanding they have been for a long time abolished throughout the rest of the kingdom. These islanders generally possess a quickness of capacity, and very readily learn whatever is taught them. They have a genius for mechanical arts, and excel in carpentry, cabinetmaking, and turnery, from the frequent occasions which they have to exercise them, all their churches and houses being buiit of wood. They are very good manufacturers of linen and woollen, with which they mix the feathers of seabirds, and form beautiful coverings for their] Si  CHILE.  
[beds. From their swine, which are very numerous, they make excellent hams, the most esteemed of any in S. America. Notwithstanding the great quantity of timber taken from them, these islands are covered with thick woods ; and as it rains there almost incessantly, the cultivated grounds continue wet the whole year. From hence it follows that the inhabitants, although they have cattle, make no use of them for ploughing, but till the earth in a very singular manner. About three months before sowing time they turn their sheep upon their lands, changing their situation every three or four nights. When the field is sufficiently manured in this manner, they strew the grain over it. One of their strongest men then attempts to harrow it by means of a machine formed of two large sticks of hard wood, made sharp, and fastened together, which he forces against the ground with his breast, and thus covers the seed. Notwithstanding this imperfect tillage, a crop of wheat will yield them ten or twelve for one. They also raisegreat quantities of barley, beans, peas, quinoa, and potatoes, which are the largest and best of any in Chile. From the excessive moisture of the atmosphere, the grape never acquires sufficient maturity to be made into wine, but its want is supplied by various kinds of cider, obtained from apples and other wild fruits of the country. The necessity they are under of often going from one island to another, where the sea is far from deserving the name of the Pacific, renders the Chilotes excellent sailors. Their pirogues are composed of three or five large planks sewed together, and caulked with a species of moss that grows on a shrub. These are in great numbers throughout the whole of the Archipelago, and are managed with sails and oars, and in these frail skiffs the natives will frequently venture as far as Concepcion : and here it may not be improper to observe, that the Indians, who form the principal part of the sailors of the S. seas, are very active and docile, and excellent seamen. These people are fond of fishing, an occupation to which they are led from the great variety of fish with which their coasts abound. Large quantities of these are dried and sent to foreign countries. They likewise dry the testaceous kinds, particularly the conchs, the clamps, and the mures. Fori his purpose they arrange them in a long trench, covering them with the large leaves of the panke iincloria. Over these they place stones, on which they make a hot fire for several hours. They then take the roasted animals from their shells, and string them upon threads, which they hang for some time in the smoke : in this manner they find them to keep very well, and so carry them to Cujo,  and other places at a distance from the sea. As soon as the Christian religion was preached in Chiloe, it was readily embraced by the natives, who have ever since continued faithful and obedient to its precepts. Their spiritual concerns are under the direction of the bishop of Concepcion, and their temporal were administered by a governor appointed by the captaingeneral of Chile ; but in 1792 it was vested in the viceroyalty of Lima. The Spaniards at present established in this Archipelago amount to about 15,000, and its commerce is conducted by means of three or four ships which trade there annually from Peru and Chile. These purchase of the natives large quantities of red cedar boards, timber of different kinds, suitable for carriages, upwards of 2000 ponchos of various qualities, hams, pilchards, dried shellfish, white cedar boxes, cloaks, embroidered girdles, and a small quantity of ambergris, which is found upon the shores ; giving in exchange wine, brandy, tobacco, sugar, herb of Paraguay, salt, and several kinds of European goods. Independently of the above trade, Chiloe has of late years been made an entrepot of illicit commerce between the Spanish colonies, and English and N. American ships engaged in the S. sea fishery. 
36. The court of audience established. — But to return to our history, the continuation ofilie war, and the great importance of the conquest, finally induced Philip II. to erect a court of royal audience in Chile, independent of that of Peru. This supreme tribunal, embracing the political, as well as military administration of the kingdom, and being composed of four judges of law, and a fiscal, made, on the 13th of August 1567, its solemn entry into Concepcion, where it fixed its residence. Immediately on assuming its functions, it removed Quiroga from _the government, and gave the command of the army, with the title of general, to Ruiz Gamboa. The military government of the royal audience was soon found to be inadequate to the purpose of its establishment, and accordingly Don Melchor de Bravo was, in 1568, invested with the triple character of president, governor, and captaingeneral of Chile. Between him and Paillatara some serious battles were fought, though not such as to alter the general state of aii'airs, when,, until the death of the latter commander, (a period of about four years), the two belligerent nations observed a truce or suspension of arms. This was probably owing in a great measure to the general consternation caused by a dreadful earthquake which wasfeltthroughout the country, and did great injury to the Spanish settlements, particularly the city of Concepcion, which was entirely destroyed.]   m  r m  

CHILE.  
[37. Suppression of the tribunal of audience. ^-ln 1575 the tribunal of audience was' suppressed, as it is asserted, on the sole principle of economy, and Rodrigo Quiroga was reinstated in the government by order of Philip II. This experienced officer, having received a reinforcement of 2000 men from Spain, gave directions to his fatherinlaw, Ruiz Gambo.i, to found a new colony at the foot of the cord/Hems, between the cities of Santiago and Concepcion, which has since received the appellation of Chilian, from the river on whose shore it stands, and has become the captial of the fertile province of that name. Shortly after the establishment of this settlement, in 15S0, the governor died at a very advanced aare, having nominated Gamboa as his successor. The three years of Gamboa's government were occupied on one side in opposing the attempts of Paynenancu, the then existing toqui, and on the other in repelling the Pehuenches and Chiquillanians, who, instigated by the Araucanians, had begun to molest the Spanish settlements. 
38. Description of the Pehuenches. — The Pehuenches form a numerous tribe, and inhabit that part of the Chilian Andes lying between lat. 34° and 37° s. to the e. of the Spanish provinces of Calchagua, Maule, Chilian, and Huilquilemu. Their dress is no way different from that of the Araucanians, except that instead of drawers or breeches, they wear around the waist a piece of cloth like the Japanese, which falls down to their knees. Their boots or shoes are all of one piece, and made from the skin of the hind leg of an ox taken off at the knee ; this they fit to the foot while green, turning the hair within, and sewing up one of the ends, the skin of the knee serving for the heel. These shoes, from being worn, and often rubbed with tallow, become as soft and pliable as the best dressed leather. Although these mountaineers have occasionally shown themselves to be valiant and hardy soldiers, they are nevertheless fond of adorning and decorating themselves like women. They wear earrings and bracelets of glass beads upon their arms ; they also ornament their hair with the same, and suspend little bells around their heads. Notwithstanding they have numerous herds of cattle and sheep, their' usual food is horseflesh, which, like the Tartars, they prefer to any other ; but, more delicate than that people, they eat it only when boiled or roasted. They dwell in the manner of the Bedouin Arabs, in tents made of skins, disposed in a circular form, leaving in the centre a spacious field, where their cattle feed during the continuance of the herbage. When that begins to fail, they transport themselves  to another situation, and in this manner, continually changing place, they traverse the valleys of the cordilleras. Each village or encampment is governed by an ulmen or hereditary prince. In their language and religion they differ not from the Araucanians. They are fond of hunting, and often, in pursuit of game, traverse the immense plains which lie between the great river of Plata and the straits of Magellan. These excursions they sometimes extend as far as Buenos Ayres, and plunder the country in the vicinity. They frequently attack the caravans of merchandize going from thence to Chile ; and so successful have they been in their enterprises, that, owing totbatcause, the commerce in that quarter was once almost entirely stopped, though very lately resumed with a tolerable degree of vigour. They have, nevertheless, for many years abstained from committing hostilities within the Chilian boundaries in time of peace ; induced either by the advantages Avhich they derive from the trade with the inhabitants, or from the fear of being roughly handled by them. Their favourite weapon is the laque, which they always carry with them fastened to their girdles. It is very probable that the ten Americans conducted by the valiant Orellana, of whose amazing courage mention is made in Lord Anson's voyage, were of this tribe. Notwithstanding their wandering and restless disposition, these people are the most industrious and commercial of any of the savages. W hen in their tents they are never idle. The women weave cloths of various colours : the men occupy themselves in making baskets anil a variety of beautiful articles of wood, feathers, or skins, which are highly prized by their neighbours. They assemble every year on the Spanish frontiers, where they hold a kind of fair, which usually continues for 15 or 20 days. Hither they bring fossil salt, gypsum, pitch, bedcoverings, ponchos, skins, wool, bridlereins beautifully wrought of plaited leather, baskets, wooden vessels, feathers ostrich eggs, horses, cattle, and a variety of other articles; and receive in exchange wheat, wine Ti,e - manuf actures of Europe.' They are very skilful in traffic, and can with difficulty be overreached. For fear of being plundered bv those who believe every thing is lawful against infidels, they never all drink at the same time, but separate themselves into several companies; and while some keep guard, the others indulge themselves in the pleasures of wine. They are generally humane, complacent, lovers of justice, and possess all those good qualities that are produced or perfected bv commerce. ■* 
39. Description of the Chiquillanians.— The"] 3x2 J   428  

CHILE.  
[Chiquillanians, whom some have erroneously supposed to be a part of the Pehuenches, live to the n. e. of (hem, on the e. borders of the Andes. These are the most savage, and of course the least numerous of any of the Chilians ; for it is an established fact, that the ruder the state of savage life, the more unfavourable it is to population. They go almost naked, merely wrapping around them the skin of the guanaco : their language is guttural, and a very corrupt jargon of the Chilian. It is observable that all the Chilians who inhabit the e. valleys of the Andes, both the Pehuenches, the Puelches, and the Huilliches, as well as the Chiquillanians, are much redder than those of their countrymen who dwell to the w. of that mountain. All these mountaineers dress themselves in skins, paint their faces, live in general by hunting, and lead a wandering and unsettled life. They are no other, as we have hitherto observed, than the so much celebrated Patagonians, who have occasionally been seen near the straits of Magellan, and have been at one time described as giants, and at another as men a little above the common stature. It is true, that they are, generally speaking, of a lofty stature and great strength. 
40. Landing and defeat of the Engish. — Now whilst the Araucanians endeavoured to oppose the progress of the Spaniards in their country, and whilst Don Alonzo Sotomayor, who succeeded Rodrigo Quiroga in the government, was strenuously exerting his influence to [suppress the Pehuenches and the Chiquillanians on the e. the English also had planned an expedition to these remote parts. On the 21st July 1586, Sir Thomas Cavendish sailed with three ships from Plymouth, and in the following year arrived on the coast of Chile. He landed in the desert port of Quintero, and endeavoured to enter into a negociation with the natives of the country. But his stay there was of short continuance ; he was attacked by Alonzo Molina, the corregidor of Santiago, and compelled to quit the coast with the loss of several of his soldiers and seamen. 
Sect. III. Comprising a period of 201 years, from 1586 to 1787. The history of the Araucanians, with regard to their wars with the Spaniards in the above period, would form little more than a recapitulation of battles similar to those already described, but bearing, nevertheless, a corroborative testimony to the exertions which a brave and generous people will ever exhibit for the just maintenance of their natural rights. The interest of these wars must, therefore, have been in a great measure anticipated,  and they will consequently be treated of in a manner much more general than those which have been already mentioned ; and this, since they will allow space for the more free detail of other political events. 
41. Nature of the war in anno 1589. — In the toquiate of Guanoalca, in 1589, the Spanish governor, Don Alonzo Satomayor, apprehensive that he should not be able to defend them, or not considering them of sufficient importance, evacuated the forts of Puren, Trinidad, and Spirito Santo, transferring the garrison to another fortress which he had directed to be built upon the river Puchanqui, ia order to protect the city of Angol : so that the war now became in a great measure reduced to the construction and demolition of fortifications. To the Toqui Guanoalca sncceeded Quintugnenu and Paillaeco, and it has been observed that the repeated victories gained over them by the Spaniards, and which they held as the cause of such exultation, were but the preludes of the severest disasters that they had ever experienced in Chile. 
42. Independence restored. — After the death of the last mentioned toqui, the Araucanians appointed to the chief command the hereditary toqui of the second uthalmapu, called Paillamachu, a man of a very advanced age, but of wonderful activity. Fortune, commonly supposed not to be propitious to the old, so far favoured his enterprises, that he surpassed all his predecessors in military glory, and had the singular felicity of restoring his country to its ancient state of independence. Owing to the continued successes of this general, on the 22d of November 1598, and under the government of Loyola, not only the Araucanian provinces, but those of the Cunchese and Huilliches were in arms, and even the whole of the country to the Archipelago of Chiloe. It is asserted, that every Spaniard who had the misfortune of being found without the garrisons was put to death ; and it is certain that the cities of Osorno, Valdivia, Villarica, Imperial, Canete, Angol, Coya, and the fortress of Arauco, were all at once invested with a close siege. But not content with this, Paillamachu, without loss of time, crossed the Biobio, burned the cities of Concepcion and Chilian, laid waste the provinces in their dependence, and returned loaded with spoil to his country. In some successive battles he likewise caused the Spaniards to evacute the fort of Arauco, and the city of Canete, and obliged the inhabitants to retire to Concepcion. On the 14th of November 1599, he caused his army to pass the broad river Calacalla or Valdivia, by swimming, stormed the city at daybreak, burned the houses,]   CHILE.  
[killed a great rmmber of the inhabitants, and attacked the vessels at anchor in the harbour, on board of which many had taken refuge, who only effected their escape by immediately setting sail. After this he returned in triumph to join Millacalquin, one of his officers, to whom he had entrusted the guard of the Biobio, with a booty of 2,000,000 of dollars, all the cannon, and upwards of 400 prisoners. 
43. Expedition of the Dutch. — Ten days after the destruction of Valdivia, Colonel Francisco Campo arrived there from Peru with a reinforcement of 300 men ; but finding it in ashes, he endeavoured, though ineffectually, to introduce those succours into the cities of Osorno, Villarica, and Imperial. Amidst so many misfortunes, an expedition of five ships of war from Holland arrived in 1600 upon the coast of Chile, which plundered the island of Chiloe, and put the Spanish garrison to the sword. Nevertheless, the crew of the commodore having landed in the little island of Talca or Santa Maria, was repulsed with the loss of 23 of their men, by the Araucanians who dwelt there, and who probably supposed them to be Spaniards. After a siege of two years and 11 months, Villarica, a very populous and opulent city, fell at length, in 1*602, into the hands of the Araucanians. A similar fate, after a short interval, was experienced by Imperial, the metropolis of the s. colonies; indeed, this city would have fallen some months before, had not its fate been protracted by the courage of a Spanish heroine, called Ines Aguilera. This lady perceiving the garrison to be discouraged, and on the point of capitulating, dissuaded them from surrendering, and directed all the operations in person, until a favourable opportunity presenting itself, she escaped by sea with the bishop and a great part of the inhabitants. She had lost during the siege her husband and brother, and her valour was rewarded by the king with an annual pension of 2000 dollars. 
44. All the Spanish settlements destroyed. — Osorno, a city not less rich and populous than the preceding, was not able much longer to resist the fate that awaited it. It fell under the violent efforts of the besiegers, who, freed from their attention to the others, were able to bring their whole force against it. Thus, in a period of little more than three years, were destroyed all the settlements which Valdivia and his successors had established and preserved at the expence of so much blood, in the extensive country between the Biobio and the Archipelago of Chiloe, none of which have been since rebuilt, as what is at present called Valdivia is no more than a fort or garrison. The sufferings   of the besieged were great, and can scarcely be exceeded by those endured in the most celebrated sieges recorded in history. They were compelled to subsist on the most loathsome food, and a piece of boiled leather was considered a sumptuous repast by the voluptuous inhabitants of Villarica and Osorno. The cities that were taken were destroyed in such a manner, that at present few vestiges of them remain, and those ruins are regarded by the natives as objects of detestation. Although great numbers of the citizens perished in the defence of their walls, the prisoners of all ranks and sexes were so numerous, that there was scarcely an Araucanian family who had not one to its share. The women were taken into the seraglios of their conquerors. Husbands were, however, permitted for the most part to retain their wives, and the unmarried to espouse the women of the country; and it is not a little remarkable that the Mustees, or offspring of these singular marriages, became in the subsequent wars the most terrible enemies of the Spanish name. The ransom and exchange of prisoners was also permitted. By this means many escaped from captivity. Some, however, induced by the love of their children, preferred to remain with their captors during their lives ; others, who acquired the affection of the people, by their pleasing manners or their skill in the arts, established themselves advantageously in the country. Among the latter were Don Basilio Roxas and Don Antonio Bascugnan, both of noble birth, who acquired high reputation among the natives, and have left interesting memoirs of the transactions of their own times. But those who fell into brutal hands had much to suffer. Paillamachu did not long enjoy the applause of his countrymen : he died at the end of the year 1603, and was succeeded by Hunecura. In consequence of the disasters the Spaniards encountered during the reign of the last mentioned toqui, and under the second government of Garcia Ramon, in 1608, the court of Spain issued orders, that hereafter there should constantly be maintained on the Araucanian frontier a body of 2000 regular troops, for whose support an appropriation of 292,279 dollars annually was made in the treasury of Peru. 
45. Court of audience reestahlished. — On the 8th of September in the following year, the royal court of audience, which had been suppressed for 34 years, was again established, though not in its ancient situation, but in the city of St. Jago, to the great satisfaction of the inhabitants ; since which period it has continued to exist with a high reputation for justice and integrity. According to the royal decree establishing the court of audience,]  CHILE.  
[the government now devolved npon the eldest son of the auditor, Don Lours Merio do la Fuente. 
46. Ineffectual efforts of Philip III. to establish a lasting peace.- — Among the missionaries about this time charged with the conversion of the Chilians, there was a Jesuit called Luis Valdivia, who perceiving that it was impossible to preach to the Araucanians during the tumult of arms, went to Spain, and represented inl the strongest terms to Philip ill. who was then on the throne, the great injury done to the cause of religion by the continuance of the war. That devout prince, who had more at heart the advancement of religion than the augmentation of his territories, sent orders immediately to the government of Chile, to discontinue the war and settle a permanent peace with the Araucanians, by establishing the river Biobio as the line of division between the two nations. The articles of peace had been discussed, and were about to be mutually agreed upon, when an unexpected event rendered abortive all the measures that had been taken. Among the wives of Ancanamon, the existing toqui, was a Spanish lady, who, taking advantage of his absence, fled for refuge to the governor, with two small children, and four women, whom she had persuaded to become Christians, two of whom were the wives, and the others the daughters of her husband. The indignation of the toqni on this occasion was carried to such an extreme, that, upon some missionaries being sent under the superintendence of Valdivia to preach the gospel among the Araucanians, he hastened to meet them at Illicura, where, without deigning to listen to their arguments, he put them all to the sword. Thus were all the plans of pacification rendered abortive ; Ancanamon incessantly harassed the Spanish provinces, and the war was recommenced in 1G 17, with greater fury than before. From the abovementioned period to the year 1637, nothing material occurred in our history, saving the enterprises of the Toquis Leintur and Putapichion ; these, however, did not serve materially to change the state of affairs. 
47. Second expedition of the Dutch. — In the following year the Dutch attempted a second time to form an alliance with the Araucanians, in order to obtain possession of Chile ; but this expedition was not more fortunate than the first. The squadron, which consisted of four ships, was dispersed by a storm on its arrival on the coast, in 16SS. A boat well manned and armed, being afterwards dispatched to the island of Mocha, belonging to the Araucanians, the inhabitants supposing that they came to attack them, fell upon the crew, put the whole to death, and took possession of the boat.  
Another crew experienced a similar misfortune in the little island of Talca or Santa Maria. The Araucanians, ns has been already observed, were equally jealous, and not (as may be readily imagined) without reason, of every European intlon. 
48. Sec &lt;nd expedition of the English. — Notwithstanding the ill success of the Dutch, Sir John Narborough, an English naval counander, undertook some years after a similar enterprise, by order of his sovereign Chaves II. ; but in passing the straits of Magellan, he lost his whole fleet, which was much better equipped than that of the Dutch. The war continued to rage with undiminished fury until the year 1640, the time when the reins of government were assumed by Don Francisco Zuniga, Marquis de Baydes. It was under his milder auspices, that, in January of the following year, the articles of peace were agreed upon, the day of its ratification being fixed for the sixth of that month, and the place of meeting, the village of Quillin, in the province of Puren. 
49. Peace at length concluded. — At the time prefixed, the marquis appeared at the appointed place, with a retinue of about 10,000 persons, from all parts of the kingdom. Lincopichion, the existing toqui, at the head of the four hereditary toquis, and a great number of ulmenes and other natives, opened the conference with a very eloquent speech. He then, according to the Chilian custom, killed a llama, and sprinkling some of the blood on a branch of cinnamon, presented it in token of peace to the governor. The articles of the treaty were next proposed and ratified, and in one of these the marquis stipulated that the Araucanians should not permit the landing of any strangers upon the coast, or furnish supplies to any foreign nation whatever; which being conformable to the political maxims of the nation, was readily complied with. Thus was a period put to a war of 90 years duration, and this grand negotiation was terminated by a sacrifice of 28 camels, and an eloquent harangue from Antiguenu, chief of the district, upon the mutual advantages which both nations would derive from the peace. 
50. Last expedition of the Dutch. — In 1643, two years after the peace, the importance of the article inserted by the governor in the treaty was rendered very apparent to the Spaniards, by a last attempt made by the Dutch to possess themselves of Chile. Their measures were so well taken, that had they been in the least seconded by the Araucanians, they must have infallibly succeeded. Having left Brazil, which they had conquered, Avith a numerous fleet, well provided with men and cannon, they took possession of the harbour of Valdivia, which]  

CHILE.  [had been deserted for more than 40 years, -where they intended to form an establishment in order to conquer the rest ofthe kingdom. With this view they immediately began building three strong forts at the entrance of the river, in order to secure its possession. The Araucanians were invited, with the most flattering promises, to join them ; this they not only declined, but strictly adhering to the stipulations ofthe treaty, refused to furnish them with provisions, of which they were greatly in want. The Cuncbese, to whom the territory which they had occupied belonged, following the counsel of their allies, refused also to treat with them or supply them. In consequence of this refusal, the Dutch, pressed with hunger, and hearing that a combined army of Spaniards and Araucanians were on their march against them, were compelled to abandon the place in three months after their landing. The Marquis de Mancura, son to the viceroy of Peru, having soon after arrived there in search of them, with 10 ships of war, fortified the harbour, and particulary the island, which has since borne the titular name of his family. On the termination of the sixth year of his government, Baydes was recalled by the court, and Don Martin Muxica appointed in his place. 
51. Dreadful earthquake. — lie succeeded in preserving the kingdom in that state of tranquillity in which he found it, no other commotion occurring during his government, but that produced by a violent earthquake, which, on the 8th of May 16-17, destroyed part of the city of St. Jago. The fortune of his successor, Don Antonio Acugna, Was very different. During his government the war was excited anew between the Spaniards and Araucanians ; but contemporary writers have left us no accounts of the causes that produced it. Clentaru, the hereditary toqui of Lauquemapu, being, in 1655, unanimously elected general, signalized his first campaign by the total defeat of the Spanish army. He, moreover, continued to persecute the Spaniards with great violence for a period of 10 years, under the governments of Don Pedro Portel Casanate, and Don Francisco Meneses. The last, who was a Portuguese by birth, had the glory of terminating it, in 1665, by a peace more permanent than that made by Baydes. All the succeeding governors appear to have kept up a good understanding with the Araucanians until the year 1686, when Garro was nearly breaking it, on occasion of removing the inhabitants of the island of Mocho to the n. shore of the Biobio, in order to cut off all communication with foreign enemies. 
52. Commerce with the French, -r-The corn-  
's mencement ofthe present asra was marked in Chile by the deposition of the Governor Don Francisco Ibanez, the rebellion of the inhabitants of Chiloe, and the, trade with the French. The islanders of Chiloe were soon restored to obedience, through the prudent conduct ofthe quartermastergeneral ofthe kingdom, Don Pedro Molina, who succeeded in reducing them rather by mild measures than by useless victories. The French, in consequence of the war of the succession, possessed themselves for a time of all the external commerce of Chile. From 1707 to 1717, its ports were filled with their ships, and they carried from thence incredible sums in gold and silver. It was at this period that the learned Father Feuille, who remained there three years, made his botanical researches and meteorological observations upon the coast. His amiable qualities obtained him the esteem ofthe inhabitants, who still cherish his memory with much affection. It was in 1722 that the Araucanians, impatient at the insolence of those who were designated by the title of captains of the friends ; and who having been introduced under pretence of guarding the missionaries, arrogated to themselves a species of authority over the natives, resolved to create a toqui, and have recourse to arms. A war in consequence ensued, but it soon became reduced to little skirmishes, which were finally terminated by the celebrated peace of Negrete, a place situated at the confluence of the rivers Biobio and Lara, where the treaty of Quillan was reconfirmed, and the odious title of captain of friends wholly abolished. 
53. How the Pehuenches became inimical to the Spaniards.— The Governor Gonzaga was the next who excited the flames of war by endeavouring to effect more than his predecessors. He undertook to compel the Araucanians to live in cities. This chimerical scheme was ridiculed by those who knew the prejudices of this people, and it was finally abandoned, not, however, till it had procured another powerful, and forever after implacable enemy to the Spaniards. This was no other than the Pehuenches, who being in the above war in alliance with the Spaniards, and who suffered a. considerable defeat whilst fighting against the Araucanians, resolved all at once to'change sides and have ever since been the firm allies of the latter. They have a practice of attacking the Spanish caravans from Buenos Ayres to Chile, and every year furnishes some melancholy information' of that kind. We shall not proceed particularly to notice several actions, and among others a bloody battle M'hich was fought in the beginning of the year 1773 ; mention of which was madein, the!   CHILE.  
[European gazettes of that period, at which time the war had cost the royal treasury and individuals 1,700,000 dollars. 
54. Peace restored. — The same year an accommodation was agreed on; and by .this it was allowed that the Araucanians should afterwards have a minister resident in the city of St. Jago. With respect to the other articles of the peace, it is sufficient to state, that the treaties of Quillan and Negrete were by mutual consent revived. On the death of Gonzaga, the court of Spain sent Don Augustin Jauregui to govern Chile, who has since filled with universal approbation the important office of viceroy of Peru. His successor, Don Ambrosio Bcnavides, has rendered the country happy by his wise and beneficent administration. 
Chap. V. 
Present slate of Chile. 
From the brief relation that we have given of the occurrences in Chile since its discovery, it will be seen that its possession has cost Spain more blood and treasure than all the rest of her settlements in America. The Araucanians, occupying but a small extent of territory, have with far inferior arms not only been able to counterbalance her power, till then reputed irresistible, but to endanger the loss of her best established possessions. Though the greater part of her officers had been bred in that school of war, the Low Countries, and her soldiers, armed with those destructive weapons before which the most extensives empires of that continent had fallen, were considered the best in the world, yet have these people succeeded in resisting them. The Spaniards, since losing their settlements in Araucania, have prudently confined their views to establishing themselves firmly in that part of Chile which lies between the s. confines of Peru and the river Biobio, and extends from lat. 24° to 36|° 5. : this they have divided into 13 provinces. They also possess the fortress of Valdivia, in the country of the Cunchese, the Archipelago of Chiloe, and the island of Juan Fernandez. vVI, 1. Civil government. - — These provinces are governed by an officer, who has usually the rank of lieutenantgeneral, and combines the title of president, governor, and captaingeneral of the kingdom of Chile, He resides in the city of St. Jago, and is solely dependent upon the king, except in caseof war, when, in certain points, he receives his directions from; the viceroy of Peru. In quality of captaingeneral he commands the army, and has under him not only the three principal officers of the kingdom, the quartermaster, the Serjeant•  major, and the commissary, but also the four governors of Chiloe, Valdivia, Valparaiso, and Juan Fernandez. As president and governor, he has the supreme administration of justice, and presides over the superior tribunals of that capital, whose jurisdiction extends all over the Spanish provinces in those parts. The principal of these is the tribunal of audience, or royal senate, whose decision is final in all causes of importance, both civil and criminal ; and is divided into two courts, the one for the trial of civil, and the other for the trial of criminal causes. Both are composed of several respectable judges, called auditors, of a regent, a fiscal or royal procurator, and a protector of the Indians. All these officers receive large salaries from the court. Their judgment is final, except in causes where the sum in litigation exceeds 10,000 dollars, when an appeal may be had to the supreme council of the Indies. The other supreme courts are those of finance, of the cruzada, of vacant lands, and the consulate or tribunal of commerce, which is wholly independent of any other of that kind. The provinces are governed by prefects, formerly called corregidors, but at present known by the name of subdelegates ; these, according to the forms of their institution, should be of royal nomination, but owing to the distance of the court they are usually appointed by the captaingeneral, of whom they style themselves the lieutenants. They have jurisdiction both of civil and military affairs, and their emoluments of office depend entirely upon their fees, which are by no means regular. In each capital of a province there is, or at least should be, a municipal magistracy, called the cabildo, which is composed, as in other parts of the Spanish dominions, of several members, called regidores, who are appointed for life, of a standardbearer, a procurator, a forensic judge, denominated the provincial alcalde, an alguazil or high sheriff, and of two consuls or burgomasters, called alcaldes. The latter are chosen annually from among the principal nobility by the cabildo itself, and have jurisdiction both in civil and criminal causes in the first instance. 
2. Military force.— 'The. inhabitants are divided into regiments, which are obliged to march to the frontiers or the seacoast in case of war. In 1792 there were 15,856 militia troops enrolled in the two bishoprics of Santiago and Concepcion ; 10,218 in the first, and 5638 in the latter. Besides this regular militia, there are a great many city militias^ that are commanded by commissaries, who act as colonels. A sufficient force also of regular troops for the defence of the country is maintained by] 1   CHILE  [the king. All the veteran troops in Chile do not exceed 2000, and these consist of artillery, dragoons, and infantry. The infantry as well as the artillery is under the command of two lieutenantcolonels. 
3. Ecclesiastical government. — As respects the ecclesiastical government, Chile is divided into the two large dioceses of St. Jago and Concepcion, which cities are the residencies of the bishops, who are suffragans to the archbishop of Lima. The first diocese extends from the confines of Peru to the river Mauie, comprehending the province of Cujo upon the other side of the Andes. The second comprises all the rest of Chile, with the islands, although the greater part of this extent is inhabited by pagans. The cathedrals are supplied with a proper number of canons, whose revenues depend upon the tithes, as do those of the bishops. The court of inquisition at Lima has at St., Jago a commissioner with several subaltern officers. Pedro Valdivia, on his first entering Chile, brought with Mm the monks of the order of Mercy; and about the year 1553, introduced the Dominicans and strict Franciscans. The Augustins established themselves there in 1595; and the Hospitallers of St. John of God, about the the year 1615. These religious orders have all a number of convents, and the three first form distinct jurisdictions. The brothers of St. John of God have the charge of the hospitals, under a commissary, who is dependent upon the provincial of Peru. These are the only religious fraternities now in Chile. The Jesuits, who came into Chile in 1593, with the nephew of their founder, Don Martin de Loyola, formed likewise a separate province. Others have several times attempted, but without success, to form establishments, the Chilians having always opposed the admission of new orders among them. In St. Jago and Concepcion are several convents of nuns ; but they are the only cities that contain them. 
4. The cities and dwellings. — The cities are built in the best situations in the country. Many of them, however, would have been better placed, for the purposes of commerce, upon the shores of the large rivers. This is particularly the case with those of more recent construction. The streets are straight, intersecting each other at right angles, and are 36 French feet in breadth. On account of earthquakes the houses are generally of one story ; they are, however, very commodious, whitewashed without, and generally painted within. Each is accommodated with a pleasant garden, irrigated by an aqueduct which furjnishes water for the use of the family. Th^se belonging to the wealthier classes, particularly the nobility, are furnished with much splendour and taste. The inhabitants perceiving that old buildings of two stories have resisted the most violent shocks &gt; have of late years ventured to reside in the upper rooms, and now begin to construct their houses in the European manner. In consequence of this the cities have a better appearance than formerly ; and the more so, as instead of forming their houses ofclay hardened in the sun, which was supposed less liable to injury, they now employ brick and stone. Cellars, sewers, and wells, were formerly much more common than at present; a circumstance which may have contributed to render the buildings more secure from earthquakes. The churches are generally more remarkable for their wealth than their style of architecture. The cathedral and the church of the Dominicans in the capital, which are built of stone, are however exceptions. The first was constructed at the royal expence, under the direction of the Bishop Don Manuel Alday, an excellent and learned prelate; it is built in a masterly style, and is 384 French feet in front. The plan was drawn by two English architects, who superintended the work : but when it was half finished they refused to go on, unless their wages were increased. In consequence of this the building was suspended, when two of the Indians who had worked under the Englishmen, and had secretly found means of instructing themselves iff every branch of the art, offered to complete it ; which they did with as much skill and perfection as their masters themselves could have displayed. In the capital the following edifices are also worthy of remark : the barracks for the dragoons, the mint, which has been lately, built by a Roman architect, and the hospital for orphans. 
5. Population. — Spanish Chile, in consequence of the freedom granted to its maritime trade, is peopling with a rapidity proportioned to the salubrity of its climate and the fertility of its soil. Its population in general is composed of Europeans, Creoles, Indians, Negroes, and Mustees. The Europeans, except a few French, English, and Italians, are Spaniards, who for the most part are from the s. provinces of Spain. D. Cosrne Bueno, whose manuscript account of Peru is stated by Robertson, as having been drawn up in 1764, (though the copies which we have seen of this work; contain facts of a later date by at least SO years)£ gives to Chile a population of 240,000 souls. Malespina, who visited that country in 1790, is of opinion that this estimate is greatly under the truth ; and we have been lately informed, on good authority, that the present population of Chile] 3 K   434  

CHILE.    [amounts to 720,000 souls, including 70,000 independent Araucanos. 
6. Chilian Creoles. — The Creoles, -who form the greater number, are the descendants of Europeans. Their character, with some slight difference, proceeding from climate or government, is precisely similar to that of the other American Creoles of European origin. The same modes of thinking, and the same moral qualities, are discernible in them all. Tiiis uniformity, which furnishes much subject for reflection, has never yet been considered by any philosopher in its full extent. Whatever intelligent and unprejudiced travellers have observed respecting the characters of the French and English Creoles, will perfectly apply to that of the Chilian. They are generally possessed of good talents, and succeed in any of the arts to which they apply themselves. They would make as great progress in the useful sciences as they have done in metaphysics, if they had the same motives to stimulate them as are found in Europe. They do not readily imbibe prejudices, and are not tenacious in retaining them. 
7. Slate of arts and sciences. — As scientific books and instruments, however, are very scarce, or sold at an exorbitant price, their talents are either never developed, or are wholly employed upon trifles. The expences of printing are also so great, as to discourage literary exertion, so that few aspire to the reputation of authors. The knowledge of the civil and canonical laws is held in great esteem by them, so that many of the Chilian youth, after having completed their course of academical education in Chile, proceed to Lima, which is highly celebrated for its schools of law, in order to be instructed in that science. The fine arts are in a very low state in Chile, and even the mechanical are as yet very far from perfection. We may except, however, those of carpentry, and the working of iron and the precious metals, which have made considerable progress, in consequence of the information obtained from some German artists, who were introduced into the country by that worthy ecclesiastic, Father Carlos, of Hainhausen in Bavaria. In a word, the arts and sciences of Chile have for these latter years much engaged the attention of the inhabitants, and it is affirmed that the state of the country has already assumed a very different appearance. 
8. The 'peasantry. — The peasantry, though for much the greater part of Spanish origin, dress in the Araucanian manner. Dispersed over that extensive country, and unencumbered by restraint, they possess perfect liberty, and lead a tranquil and happy life, amidst the enjoyments of that de-  lightful climate. Raynal observes, " the principal part of these robust men live dispersed upon their possessions, and cultivate with their own hands a greater or less extent of ground. They are incited to this laudable labour by a sky always clear and serene, and a climate the most agreeably temperate of any in the two hemispheres, but more especially by a soil whose fertility has excited the admiration of all travellers." They are naturally gay and fond of all kinds of diversion. They have likewise a taste for music, and compose verses after their manner, which, although rude and inelegant, possess a certain natural simplicity more interesting than the laboured compositions of cultivated poets. Extemporaneous rhymes, or improvisator!, are common among them, and are called in their language palladores. Those known to possess this talent are held in high estimation, and apply themselves to no other occupation. In the countries dependent on the Spanish colonies, there is generally no other language than the Spanish spoken, but on the frontiers the peasants speak the Araucanian or Chilian, as well as the former. 
9. Dress, Sfc. — The men dress in the French, and the women in the Peruvian fashion, except that the women of Chile wear theirgarments longer than those of Peru. In point of luxury, there is no difference between the inhabitants of the two countries ; Lima prescribes the .fashions for Chile, as Paris does for the rest of Europe. Those who are wealthy make a splendid display in their dress,  their servants, coaches, or titles.  
Chile alone, of  all the American provinces, has enjoyed the superior privilege of having two of its citizens exalted to the dignity of grandees of Spain ; the one Don Fernando Irrazabal, Marquis of Valparaiso ; the other, Don Fermin Caravajal, Duke of St. Carlos. 10. Diseases ; smallpox, how cured. — The salubrity of theair, and the constant exercise on horseback to Which they accustom themselves from childhood, render them strong and active, and preserve them from many diseases. The smallpox is not so common as in Europe, but it makes terrible ravages when it appears. This disease was, in the year 1766, for the first time introduced into the province of Maule, where it became very fatal. A countryman who had recovered from it, conceived the idea of attempting to cure a number of unhappy wretches, who had been abandoned, by cow's milk, which he gave them to drink, or administered to them in clysters. With this simple remedy he cured all those whom he attended ; while the physicians, with their complicated prescriptions, saved but a very few. This anecdote is supported by, at the same time that it tends strongly]   

CHILE.  [to confirm, the experiments of M. Lassone, physician to the queen of France, in the cure of the smallpox with cow's milk, published by himself in the Medical Transactions of Paris for the year 1779. The countryman, however, employed milk alone, whereas M. De Lassone thought it advisable to mix it with a decoction of parsley roots. These instances would seem to prove that milk has the singular p r operty of lessening the virulence of this disorder, and repressing its noxious and deadly qualities. It is for the ilenneriaus to consider how far these facts may corroborate, or what may be their analogy to the principles that are inculcated by the vaccine institutions of this country. 
11. Manners, moral and physical. — The inhabitants of the country are generally very benevolent. Contented with a comfortable subsistence, they may be said scarcely to know what parsimony or avarice is, and are very rarely affected with that vice. Their houses are open to all travellers that come, whom they freely entertain without any idea of pav, and often ou these occasions regret that they are not more wealthy, in order to exercise their hospitality to a greater extent. This virtue is also common in the cities, anil Feuille observes, that " the ill return that they have frequently met with from individuals of our nation, has never been able to produce a diminution of their native hospitality." vol. II. To this hospitality it is owing that they have not hitherto been attentive to the erection of inns and public lodging houses ; which will, however, become necessary when the coin. . raerce of the interior is more increased. Lord Anson, in his voyage, gives a particular description of the dexterity of the South American pea- ,sants in managing the laqui, with which they take animals, either wild or domestic. In Chile, the inhabitants of the country constantly carry this laqui with them, fastened to their saddles, in order to have it ready upon occasion, and arc very skilful in the use of it. It consists merely in a strip of leather several fathoms in length, well twisted in the manner of a cord, and terminated by a strong noose of the same material. They make use of it both on foot and on horseback, and in the latter case with equal certainty, whether amidst woods, mountains, or steep declivities. On these occasions one end of it is fastened under the horse's belly, and the other held by the rider, who throws it over the flying animal with a dexterity that scarcely ever misses its aim. Herodotus makes mention of a similar noose which was used in battle by the Sagartians. " The Sagartii," he observes, " were originally of Persian descent, and use the Persian language : they have no offensive weapons  either of iron or brass, except their daggers : their principal dependence in action is upon cords made of twisted leather, which they use in tins manner : when they engage an enemy, they throw out these cords, having a noose at the extremity ; if they entangle in them either horse or man, they without difficulty put them to death." Beloe's Herodotus, vol. III. Polymnia, p. 205. The Chilians have also employed the laqui with much success against the English pirates who have landed upon their coast. They are also skilful in the management of horses, and in the opinion of travellers, who have had an opportunity of witnessing their dexterity and courage in this exercise, they might soon be formed into the best body of cavalry in the world. Their attachment to horses renders them particularly fond of horseracing, which they conduct in the English manner. The Negroes, who havebceu introduced into Chile wholly by contraband means, are subjected to a state of servitude, which may be considered as tolerable in comparison to that which they endure in many parts of America, where the interest of the planter stifles every sentiment of humanity. As the planting of sugar and other articles of West Indian commerce has not been established in Chile, the slaves are employed in domestic services, where by attention and diligence they may readily acquire the favour of their masters. Those in most esteem are either such as are born in the country of African parents, or the Mulattoes, as they become more attached to the fa-" mily to which they belong. The humanity of the government or the inhabitants has introduced in favour of this unfortunate race a very proper regulation. Such of them as by their industry have obtained a sum of money sufficient for the purchase of a slave, can ransom ihemselves by paying it to their masters, who are obliged to receive it, and set them at liberty ; and numbers Avho have in this manner obtained their freedom, are to be met with throughout the country. The same law subsists in all the Spanish colonies ; and a slave who cannot redeem himself entirely, is allowed to redeem one or more days in the week, by paying a proportion of his price. Those who are ill treated by their owners can demand a letter of sale, which is a written permission to them to seek a purchaser. In case of the master's refusal, they have the privilege of applying to the judge of the place, who examines their complaints, and if well founded, grants them the permission required. Such instances are, however. Tery unusual, either because the master, on account of his reputation, avoids reducing his slaves to this extremity, or that the slaves themselves contract such an attachment to] 3 k 2  
43G  
G HI L E.  
[their masters, that the greatest punishment inflicted on them would be to sell them to others. Masters nevertheless exercise the rights of fathers of families over their slaves, in correcting them for their faults. 
12. Internal and external commerce, mines, imports, and exports. — The internal commerce of Chile has been hitherto of very little importance, notwithstanding the advantages that the country offers for its encouragement. Its principal source, industry, or more properly speaking, necessity, is wanting. An extensive commerce is correlative with a great population, and in proportion as the latter increases, the former will also be augmented. Hitherto it may be said, that of the two branches that in general give birth to commerce, agriculture and industry, the first is that alone which animates the internal commerce of Chile, and even that part of the external which is carried on with Peru. The working of mines also occupies the attention of many in the provinces of Copiapo, Coquimbo, and Quillota ; but the industry is so trifling that it does not deserve the name. Notwithstanding the abundance of its fruits and materials of manufacture, as flax, wool, hemp, skins and metals, which might produce a flourishing commerce, it is conducted but languidly. The inhabitants employ themselves only in making ponchos, stockings, socks, carpets, blankets, skincoats, saddles, hats, and other small articles chiefly made use of by the common or poorer class of people, since those of the middle rank employ those of European manufacture. These, but more particularly the sale of hides and tanned leather, which they have in great plenty, with that of grain and wine, form the whole of the internal commerce of the kingdom. The external, which is carried on with all the ports of Peru, particularly Callao, arises from the exportation of fruits; this amounts to 700,000 dollars annually, according to the statements given in the periodical publications at Lima. The commerce between Chile and Buenos Ayres is quite otherwise, since for the herb of Paragway alone, it is obliged to advance 300,000 dollars annually in cash; the other articles received from thence arc probably paid for by those sent thither. In the trade with Spain, the fruits received from Chile go but a little way in payment of more than a million of dollars, which are received from thence annually in European goods, either directly, or by the way of Buenos Ayres, and sometimes from Lima. Gold, silver, and copper, are the articles which form nearly the whole of this commerce, since the hides and vicuna wool are in such small quantities as to render them of little importance.  
Notwithstandingthe working of the mines in Chile has in a great measure been relinquished from theexpence,and from the impediments offered by the warlike spirit of the Araucanians, there are more than a thousand now in work between the cities of Coquimbo and Copiapo, besides those of the province of Aconcagua ; and it is a matter of fact that the produce of its mines has been increasing ever since that the passage into the S. sea by cape Horn was frequented by the Spanish merchants. The gold coined in the capital was lately regulated at 5200 marks annually ; but the present yearly produce of the mines, as calculated from the amounts of the royal duties, and therefore considerably under the truth, amounts to 10,000 Spanish marks of pure gold, and 29,700 do. of pure silver. The value in dollars of both is 1,737,380 ; the gold being estimated at 145 -?£$ dollars, and the silver at 9/o dollars the Spanish mark. Besides this, we must add for contraband 322,620 dollars ; and the total produce will then be 2,060,000. According to Humboldt, the dollars imported into Chile and Peru in 1803 amounted to 11,500,000, and the exports consisted of produce to the value of 4,000,000 dollars, besides 8,000,000 dollars in specie. The receipts of Chile, Guatemala, and Caracas, are consumed within the country. The remittances of gold and silver to Spain are usually made from Buenos Ayres ; the first being less bulky, is carried by the monthly packets in sums of 2 or 3000 ounces ; as to the second, it has, till within a very late period, been sent in two convoy ships in the summer, by which conveyances gold is also remitted. The copper which is extracted from the mines is estimated from 8 to 10,000 quintals.. From these data it will not be difficult to form a general estimate of all that Chile produces annually. A communication by water, which greatly facilitates the progress of commerce, has been already commenced. In several of the ports, barks are employed in the transportation v TOf merchandize, which was before carried by; land upon mules. Several large ships have also been built in the harbour of Concepcion and the mouth of the river Maule. The external commerce is carried on with Peru and Spain. In the first, 23 or 24 ships, of 5 or 600 tons each, are employed, which are partly Chilian and partly Peruvian. These usually make three voyages in a year; they carry from Chile wheat, wine, pulse, almonds, nuts, cocoanuts, conserves, dried meat, tallow, lard, cheese, soleleather, timber for building, copper, and a variety of other articles, and bring back in return silver, sugar, rice and cotton. The Spanish ships receive in exchange for Euro-]  

CHILE.  [pean merchandise gold, silver, copper, vicugna wool, and hides. A trade with the East Indies would be more profitable to the Chilians than any other, as their most valuable articles have either become scarce, or are not produced in that wealthy part of Asia ; and the passage, in consequence of the prevalence of the s. winds in the Pacific, would be easy and expeditious. No money is coined or has currency in Chile except gold and silver, a circumstance very embarrassing to the internal traffic. Their smallest silver coin is one sixteenth of a dollar, and their weights and measures are the same that are used in Madrid. 
13. Natural divisions. — Chile, properly called, or that part which is situated between the Andes and the sea, and within lat. 24° and 45° s. is at least 120 miles in breadth. It is commonly divided into two equal parts, that is, the maritime country, and the midland country ; the maritime country is intersected by three chains of mountains, running parallel to the Andes, between which are numerous valleys watered by delightful rivers. The midland country is almost flat ; a few insulated hills only are to be seen, which diversify and render the appearance of it more pleasing. The Andes, which are considered as the loftiest mountains in the world, cross the whole continent of America, in a direction from s. to n. for we cannot consider the mountains in North America in any other light than as a continuation of the Cordilleras. The part appertaining to Chile may be 120 miles in breadth ; it consists of a great number of mountains, all of them of a prodigious height, which appear to be chained to each other, and where nature displays all the beauties and all the horrors of the most picturesque situations. Although it abounds with frightful precipices, many agreeable valleys and fertile pastures are to be found there ; and the rivers, which derive their sources from the mountains, often exhibit the most pleasing as well as the most terrifying features. That portion of the cordilleras which is situated between lat. 24° and S3° is wholly desert ; but the remainder, as far as the 45°, is inhabited by some colonies of Chilians, who are called Chiquillanes, Pehuenches, Puelches, and Huilliches, but are more generally known by the name of Patagonians. The surface of Chile is estimated at 378,000 square miles. There are about eight or nine roads which cross its Cordillera; of which that leading from the province of Aconcagua to Cuyo, although dangerous, as being narrow, and having on either side lofty and perpendicular mountains, is the most travelled. Mules are often precipitated from these roads into the rivers beneath.  
14. Political divisions. — The political, divisions of Chile consist of the part occupied by the Spaniards, and that which is inhabited by the Indians. The Spanish part is situated between lat^245a c nd 37° 5. and is divided into 13 provinces, viz. Copiapo, Coquimbo, Quillota, Aconcagua, Melipilla, and St. J ago, (which contains the capital'cfity of the country of the same name), Rancagua; Calchagua, Maule, Ylata, Chilian, Puchacayy and Huilquelemu. The Indian country is situated: between the river Biobio and the Archipelago l&gt;f Chiloe, or lat. 36° and 41°. It is inhabited bylfaree different nations, the Araucanians, the CundhSs, and the Huilliches. The Araucanians do not," as Mr. De Paun pretends, inhabit the barren rocks of Chile, but, on the contrary, the finest plains in the whole country, situate between the rivers: Bidbio and Valdivia. 
15. Climate.-*— Chile is one of the best countries in America. The beauties of its sky, the constant mildness of its climate, and its abundant fertility, render it, as a place of residence, extremely agreeable ; and with respect to its natural productions, it may be said, without exaggeration, not to be inferior to any portion of the globe. The seasons succeed each other regularly, and are sufficiently marked, although the transition from cold to. heat is very moderate. The spring in Chile commences, as in all the countries of the s. hemisphere, the 22d September, the summer in December, the autumn in March, and the winter in June. The following account is from Robertson's History of America^ vol. IV. c. 7. " That part of Chile which may properly be deemed a Spanish province, isa narrow district, extending along the coast froiU the desert of Atacamas to the island of Chiloe, above 900 miles, lis climate is the most delicious of the new world, and is hardly equalled by that of any region on the face of the earth. Though bordering on the torrid zone, it never feels the extremity of heat, being screened on the^. by the Andes, and refreshed from the w. by cooling seabreezes. The temperature of the air is so mild and equable, that the Spaniards give it the preference of that of the *. provinces in their native country. The fertility of the soil corresponds with the benignity of the climate,, and is wonderfully accommodated to European productions. The most valuable of these,, corn, wine, and oil, abound in Chileans if they had been native in the country.,AH i;he fruits imported from Europe attain to full maturity there. The animals of our hemisphere not only multiply, but improve in this delightful region. The horsed cattle are of larger size than those of Spain, its breed of horses surpasses, both in beauty and in"}  sasa    438  

CHILE.  
[spirit, the famous Andaluciati race, from which they sprang. Nor has Nature exhausted her bounty on the surface of the earth ; she has stored its bowels with riches: valuable mines of gold, of silver, of copper, and of lead, have been discovered in various parts of it. A country distinguished by so many blessings, we may be apt to conclude, would early become a favourite station of the Spaniards, and must have been cultivated with peculiar predilection and care ; instead of this, a great part of it remains unoccupied. In all this extent of country there are not above 80,000 white inhabitants, and about three times that number of Negroes and people of a mixed race. The most fertile soil in America lies uncultivated, and some of its most promising mines remain unwrought." 
16. Of rain. — From the beginning of spring until autumn, there is throughout Chile a constant succession of fine weather, particularly between the 24° and 36° of latitude ; but in the islands, which for the most part are covered with woods, the rains are very frequent, even in summer. The rainy season on the continent usually commences in April, and continues until the end of August. In the n. provinces of Coquimbo and Copiapo it very rarely rains ; in the central ones it usually rains three or four days in succession, and the pleasant weather continues 15 or 20 days ; in the s. the rains are much more frequent, and often continue for nine or ten days without cessation. These rains are never accompanied with storms or hail, and thunder is scarcely known in the country, particularly in places at a distance from the Andes, where, even in summer, it is seldom ever heard. Lightning is wholly unknown in tile province of Chile; and although, in the abovementioned mountains, and near the sea, storms occasionally arise, yet they, according to the direction of the wind, pass over, and take their course to the n. or s. In the maritime provinces snow is never seen. In those nearer the Andes it falls' about once in five years; sometimes not so often, and the quantity very trifling ; it usually melts while falling, and it is very uncommon'' to have it remain on the ground for a day. In the Andes, however, it falls in such quantities from April to November, that it not only lies there con, stantly during that time, but even renders them wholly impassable during the greater part of the year. The highest summits of these mountains, which are constantly covered with snow, are distinguishable at a great distance by their whiteness, and form a very singular and pleasing appearance. Those of the inhabitants who are not sufficiently wealthy to have icehouses, procure snow from the mountains, which they transport upon mules. The consumption of this article is very considerable, as a general use is made of it in summer to cool their liquors. The maritime countries being at a distance from the Andes, do not enjoy this advantage, but they feel the privation of it less, as the heat is much more moderate upon the coast than in the interior. In the midland provinces is sometimes seen, in the month of August, a white frost, accompanied by a slight degree of cold, which is the greatest that is experienced in those districts. This coldness continues two or three hours after sunrise; from which time the weather is like that of a fine day in spring. The dews are abundant throughout Chile in the spring, summer, and autumnal nights, and in a great measure supply the want of rain during those seasons. Although the atmosphere is then loaded with humidity, its salubrity is not injured thereby, for both husbandmen and travellers sleep in the open air with perfect security. Fogs are common on the coast, especially in the autumn ; they continue but a few hours in the morning, and as they consist only of watery particles, are not prejudicial either to the health of the inhabitants, or to the vegetation. 
17. Winds. — The n. and n. w. Avinds usually bring rain, and the s. and s. e. a clear sky ; these serve as infallible indications to the inhabitants, who are observant of them, and furnish themselves with a kind of barometer to determine previously the state of the weather. The same winds produce directly contrary effects in the s. and in the n. hemispheres. The n. and northerly winds, before they arrive at Chile, cross the torrid zone, and there becoming loaded with vapours, bring with them heat and rain ; this heat is, however, very moderate, and it would seem that these winds, in crossing the Andes, which are constantly covered Avith snow, become qualified, and lose much of their heat and unhealthy properties. In Tucuman and Cujo, where they are known by the name of sonda, they are much more incommodious, and are more suffocating than even the siroc in Italy. The 5. winds coming immediately from the antarctic pole, are cold and dry; these are usually from the s.w. and prevail in Chile during the time that the sun is in the s. hemisphere ; they blow constantly towards the equator, the atmosphere at that period being highly rarefied, and no adverse current of air opposing itself to their course* as they disperse the vapours, and drive them towards the Andes, it rains but seldom during their continuance. The clouds collected upon these mountains, uniting with those]    CHILE.  [which come from the n. occasion very heavy rains, accompanied with thunder, in all the provinces beyond the Andes, particularly in those of Tucumanand Cujo, while at the same time the atmosphere of Chile is constantly clear, and its inhabitants enjoy their finest season. The contrary takes place in winter, which is the fine season in these provinces, and the rainy in Chile. Thes. wind never continues blowing during the whole day with the same force ; as the sun approaches the meridian, it falls very considerably, and rises again in the afternoon. At noon, when this wind is scarcely perceptible, a fresh breeze is felt from the sea, which continues about two or three hours ; the husbandmen give it the name of the twelve o'clock breeze, or the country man's watch, as it serves to regulate them in determining that hour. This seabreeze returns regularly at midnight, and is supposed to be produced by, the tide; it is stronger in autumn, and sometimes accompanied with hail. The e. winds rarely prevail in Chile, their course being obstructed by the Andes. Hurricanes, so common in the Antilles, are unknown here; there exists indeed a solitary example of a hurricane, which, in 1633, did much injury to the fortress of Caremalpo, in the s. part of Chile. The mild temperature which Chile almost always enjoys must depend entirely upon the succession of these winds, as a situation so near the tropic would naturally expose it to a more violent degree of heat. In addition to those, the tide, the abundant dews, and certain winds from the Andes, which are distinct from the e. wind, cool the air so much in summer, that in the shade no one is ever incommoded with perspiration. The dress of the inhabitants of the seacoast is the same in the winter as in the summer ; and in the interior, where the heat is more, perceptible than elsewhere, Reaumur's thermometer scarcely ever exceeds 25°. The nights, throughout the country, are generally of a very agreeable temperature. Notwithstanding the moderate heat of Chile, all the fruits of warm countries, and even those of the tropics, ^arrive to great perfection there, which renders it probable that the warmth of the soil far exceeds that of the atmosphere. The countries bordering on the e. of Chile do not enjoy these refreshing winds ; the air there is suffocating, and as oppressive as in Africa under the same latitude. 

IS. Meteors. — Meteors are very frequent in Chile, especially those called shooting stars, which are to be seen there almost the whole year ; also balls of fire, that usually rise from the Andes, and fall into the sea. The aurora australis, on the the contrary, is very uncommon ; that which was  observed in 1640 was one of the largest; it was visible, from the accounts that have been left us from the month of February until April. During this century they have appeared at four different times. This phenomenon is more frequently visible in the Archipelago of Chiloe, from the greater elevation of the pole in that part of the country. 
19. Volcanoes. — That a country producing such an abundance of sulphureous, nitrous, and bituminous substances, should be subject to volcanic eruptions, is not to be wondered at. The numerous volcanoes in the Cordilleras would, of themselves, furnish a sufficient proof of the quantity of these combustible materials ; there are said to be 14 which are in a constant state of eruption, and a still greater number that discharge smoke only at intervals. These are all situated in that part of the Andes appertaining to Chile, and nearly in the middle of that range of mountains ; so that the lava and ashes thrown out by them never extend beyond their limits. These mountains and their vicinities are found, on examination, to contain great quantities of sulphur and salammoniac, marcasite in an entire and decomposed state, calcined and crystallized stones, and various metallic substances. The greatest eruption ever known in Chile was that of Peteroa, which happened on the 3d of December 1760, when that volcano formed itself a new crater, and a neighbouring mountain was rent asunder for many miles in extent ; the eruption was accompanied by a dreadful explosion, which was heard throughout the whole country ; fortunately it was not succeeded by any very violent shocks of an earthquake : the quan» tity" of lava and ashes was so great that it filled the neighbouring valleys, and occasioned a rise of the waters of the Tingeraca, which continued for many days. At the same time the course of the Lontue, a very considerable river, was impeded for 10 days, by a part of the mountain which fell and filled its bed ; the water at length forced itself a passage, overflowed all the neighbouring plains, and formed a lake which still remains. In the whole of the country not included in the Andes, there are but two volcanoes ; the first, situate at the mouth of the river Rapel, is small, and discharges only a little smoke from time to time ; the second is the great volcano of Villarica, in the country of Arauco. This volcano may be seen at the distance of 150 miles ; and although it appears to be insulated, it is said to be connected by its base with the Andes. The summit of the mountain is covered with snow, and is in a constant state of eruption ; it is 14 miles in circumference at its base, which is principally covered with]  
~    440  

CHILE.  
[pleasant forests : a great number of rivers derive *heir sources from it, and its perpetual verdure turnisbes a proof that its eruptions have never been very violent. 
20. Earthquakes. — The quantity of inflammable substances with which the soil of Chile abounds, rendered active by the electric fluid, may be considered as one of the principal causes of earthquakes, the only scourge that afflicts this favoured country. Another, however, not less capable of producing this terrible phenomenon, is the elasticity of the air contained in the bowels of the earth,in consequence of the water wh ich,insinuating itself by subterranean passages from the sea, becomes changed into vapour. This hypothesis will explain why the provinces to the e. of the Andes, at a distance from the sea, are so little incommoded by earthquakes. Two, however, Copiapo and Coquimbo, although near the sea, and as rich in minerals as the ethers, have never suffered from earthquakes; and whilst the other parts of the country have been violently shaken, these have not experienced the least shock, or been but slightly agitated. It is a general opinion that the earth in these provinces is intersected by large caverns. The noises heard in many places, and which appear to indicate the passage of waters, or subterraneous winds, seem to confirm this opinion, and it is highly probable that by affording a free vent to the inflamed substances, these caverns may serve to counteract the progress of those convulsions to which the neighbouring country is subject. The inhabitants usually calculate three or four earthquakes at Chile annually, but they are very slight, and little attention is paid to them. The great earthquakes happen but rarely, and of these not more than five have occurred in a period of 244 years, from the arrival of the Spaniards to the present period, 1812. From a course of accurate observations it has been ascertained, that earthquakes never occur unexpectedly in this country, but are always announced by a hollow sound proceeding from a vibration of the air ; and as the shocks do not succeed each other rapidly, the inhabitants have sufficient time to provide for their safety. They have, however, in order to secure themselves at all events, built their cities in a very judicious manner ; the streets are left so broad that the inhabitants would be safe in the middle of them, should even the houses fall upon both sides. In addition to this, all the houses have spacious courts and gardens, which would serve as places of refuge; those who are wealthy have usually in their gardens several neat wooden barracks, where "they pass the night whenever they are  threatened with an earthqnake. Under these circumstances the Chilians live without apprehension, especially as the earthquakes have never been hitherto attended with any considerable sinking of the earth, or falling of buildings ; this is probably owing to subterranean passages communicating with the volcanoes of the Andes, which are so many ventholes for the inflamed substances, and serve to counteract their effects. Were it not for the number of these volcanoes, Chile would, in all probability, be rendered uninhabitable. Some pretend that they can foretel an earthquake from certain changes in the atmosphere : although this does not appear to be impossible, it is altogether discredited by many of the best writers on Chile : these observe that they will occur both in the rainy and dry seasons, during a storm as well as a calm. 
21. Some detail of productions. — Chile produces none of those dangerous or venomous animals which are so much dreaded in hot countries ; and it has but one species of small serpent, which is perfectly harmless, as the French academicians ascertained when they went to Peru, in 1736, to measure a degree of the meridian. XJlloa also, in his Voyage, part II. vol. 111. observes, " This country is not infested by any kind of insect except the chiguas, or pricker, or. any poisonous reptile ; and although in the woods and fields some snakes are to be found, their bite is by no means dangerous ; nor does any savage or ferocious beast excite terror in its plains. The puma, or American lion, which is sometimes met with in the thickest and least frequented forests, is distinguished from the African lion, both by its being without a mane and its timidity ; there is no instance of its ever having attacked a man, and a person may not only travel, but lie down to sleep with perfect security, in any part of the plain, and even in the thickest forests of the mountains. Neither tigers, wolves, nor many other ferocious beasts that infest the neighbouring countries, are known there. Probably the great ridge of the Andes, which is every where extremely steep, and covered with snow, serves as a barrier to their passage. The mildness of the climate may also be unfavourable to them, as the greater part of these animals are natives of the hottest countries. Horses, asses, cattle, sheep, goats, many kinds of dogs, cats, and even mice, have been brought hither by the Spaniards. All these animals have multiplied exceedingly, and increased in size. The price of the best horses is from J00 to 500 crowns ; the asses are strong and stately, though hunted chiefly for their skins ; and the mules are]  [distinguished for being very surefooted and active. The horned cattle have, through the favourable temperature of the climate, acquired a larger size, while their flesh has become better and more nutritive ; the sheep imported from Spain retain a ■wool as beautiful as that of the best Spanish sheep, each sheep yielding annually from 10 to 15 lbs. of ■wool ; they breed twice ayear, and have generally two at a birth. The common price of cattle throughout the country is from three to four filippi (fifteen or twenty francs), but in the seaports the price is fixed by an ancient regulation, at 10 crowns ; of which the commandant of the port receives four, and the owner six. 
The different kinds of trees known in Chile amount to 97, and of these only 13 shed their leaves : amongst the plants, there are 3000 not mentioned in botanical works. The melons here are, according to Molina, three feet long, and the only fruits unknown are medlars, service apples, threegrained medlar, and the jujubre. Of the indigenous worms, insects, &amp;c. are 36 species, andthetunicated cuttlefish found here is of 150 lbs. weight. There are 13 species of crabs and crawfish found on the seacoast, and four species in the fresh waters. There are 135 species of landbirds, and of quadrupeds 36, without those imported. The various kinds of esculent fish found upon the coast are computed by the fishermen at 76, the most of them differing from those of the n. hemisphere, and appearing to be peculiar to that sea. 
Amongst the earths of this country is a clay thought to be very analogous to kaolin of the Chinese ; another kind called rovo, producing an excellent black dye, and represented by Feuille and Frazier as superior to the best European blacks. The membraneous mica, otherwise Muscovy grass, is also found here in the greatest perfection, both as respects its transparency and the size of its lamina} ; of this substance the country 
Seople manufacture artificial flowers, and like the Russians, make use of it for glazing their houses. The thin plates which are used for windows are by many preferred to glass, from their being pliable and less fragile, and possessing what appears to be a peculiar property, of freely admitting the light and a view of external objects to those within, while persons without are prevented from seeing any thing in the house. 
22. Present revolution.— In Chile, the authority of the mother country has been superseded by the aristocracy of the colony. The government has fallen, peaceably and without resistance, into the hands of the great Creole families, who CHI  
44 I  seem hitherto to have used their power with temper and moderation. See La Plata.]

==[[Chilloa|CHILLOA|Chillo]]==, a Uanura of the kingdom of Quito, near this capital, between two chains of mountains, one very lofty towards the e. and the other lower towards the s. It is watered by two principal rivers, the Pita and the Amaguana, which at the end of the Uanura unite themselves at the foot of the mountain called Guangapolo, in the territory of tlie settlement of Alangasi, and at the spot called Las J untas. In this plain lie the settlements of Amaguana, Sangolqui, Alangasi, andConocoto, all of which are curacies of the jurisdiction of Quito, ltisofamild and pleasant temperature, although sometimes rather cold, from its proximity to the mountains or paramos of Pintac, Antisana, Ruminavi, and Sincholagua. Here was formerly celebrated the cavalgata, by the collegians of the head college and seminary of San Luis de Quito, during the vacations. The soil produces abundance of wheat and maize. It is much resorted to by the gentlemen of Quito as a place of recreation. It is eight or nine leagues in length, and six in width.

==[[Chiloe|CHILOE]]==, a large island of the Archipelago or Ancud of the kingdom of Chile, being one of the 18 provinces or corregimienlos which compose it. It is 38 leagues in length, and nine in width at the broadest part ; and varies until it reaches only two leagues across, which is its narrowest part. It is of a cold temperature, being very subject to heavy rains and fresh winds ; notwithstanding  
CHI . which its climate is healthy. Around it are four other islands ; and the number of settlements in these are 25, which are, 
Achau, Quehuy, 
Linlin, Chelin, 
Llinua, Limuy, 
Quenac, Tanqui^ 
Meulin, Chiduapi, 
Cahuac, Abtau, 
Alau, Tabor, 
Apiau, Quenu, 
Chaulinec, Llaycha, 
Anihue, Huar, 
Chegniau, Calbuco, 
Vuta-Chauquis, Isla Grande. 
Caucahue, All of these are mountainous, little cultivatad, and produce only a small proportion of wheat, barley, flax, and papas, esteemed the best of any in America ; besides some swine, of which hams are made, which they cure by frost, and are of so delicate a flavour as not only to be highly esteemed here, but in all other parts, both in and out of the kingdom, and are in fact a very large branch of commerce. The principal trade, however, consists in planks of several exquisite woods, the trees of which are so thick, that from each of them an* cut in general 600 planks, of 20 feet in length, and of If foot in width. Some of these trees have measured 24 yards in circumference. The natives make various kinds of woollen garments, such as ponchos, quilts, coverlids, baizes, and bor~ dittos. The whole of this province is for the most part poor : its natives live very frugally, and with little communication with any other part of the world, save with those who are aceustomed to come hither in the fleet once ayear. Although it has some small settlements on the continent, in Valdivia, yet these are more than 20 or 30 leagues distant from this place, and are inhabited by infidel Indians. These islands abound in delicate shellfish of various kinds, and in a variety of other fish ; in the taking of which the inhabitants are much occupied, and on which they chiefly subsist. This jurisdiction is bounded on the n. by the territory of the ancient city of Osorno, which was destroyed by the Araucanian Indians, s. by the extensive Archipelagoes of Huayaneco and Huaytecas, and others which reach as far as the straits of Magellan and the Terra del Fuego, e. by the corditteras and the Patagonian country, and zo. by the Pacific or S. sea. On its mountains are found amber, and something resembling gold dust, which is washed up by the rains, although no   CHI mines have as yet been discovered here. These islands have some ports, but such as are small, insecure, and without any defence, with the exception of that of Chacao. The inhabitants should amount to 22,000 souls, and these are divided into 4 I settlements or parishes, being formed by the reducciones of the missionaries of St. Francis, and consisting at the present day, for the most part, of Spaniards and Creoles. The capital is the city of Santiago de Castro, in the large island of Chiloe. [For further account, see index to additional history of Chile, chap. IV. § 35.]

CHILQUES y Masques, a province and corregimiento of Peru, bounded by the province of Quispicanchi; s. e. by that of Chumbivilcas ; *. and s. w. by that of Cotabambas ; w. by that of Abancay; and n.w. by Cuzco. Its temperature is various, the proportion of heat and cold being regulated by its different degrees of elevation ; so that in the quebradas or deep glens, it is warm, and in the sierras or mountains, cold. It is 13 leagues in length, and 25 in width ; is watered by three rivers, which are the Cusibamba, passing through the valley of this name, the Velille, and the Santo Tomas ; over these rivers are extended seven bridges, which form a communication with the other provinces. It has likewise eight small lakes, and in some of these are found waterfowl. The hot parts abound in all kinds of fruits ; in wheat, maize, pulse, potatoes, and are well stocked with some sorts of cattle, and great herds of deer. Its natives fabricate the manufactures of the country ; such as cloths, baizes, and coarse frieze, by means of chorillos, or running streams, as they have no mills for fulling, since a royal licence is necessary for the making use of the same. Although the appearance of mines has in many places been discovered amongst the mountains, yet no mines have as yet been worked, and two only have been known to have been opened in former times. This province has suffered much from earthquakes ; and the greatest of these happened in 1707, when many settlements were made    desolate. It is composed of 27 settlements, and these contain 16,000 inhabitants. The capital is Paruro ; and the repartimiento of the corregimiento used to amount to 84,550 dollars, and the alcavala to 676 dollars per ann. The other settlements are,

CM1==[[Ltepec|LTEPEC]]==, a settlement of the head settlement of Tepalcatepec in Nueva Espafia. Its temperature is the mildest of any part of its jurisdiction. It is situate in the middle of a plain, extending over the top of a hill, on two sides of which are large chasms, so immensely deep, that it is really astonishing to observe how the Indians contrive to cultivate the napokras on their edges. It contains 67 families of Indians, and is five leagues to the s. of its head settlement. Chiltepec, a river of the province and alcaldia mayor of Tabasco, which runs into the sea. 

==[[Chilua|CHILUA]]==, San Marcos de, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Huanta in Peru ; annexed to the Curacy of Huamanguilla.

It is entirely covered with woods and with streams, which flow down from the heights into the plains of Babahoyo. The river named De la Chiina runs from e. to a), until it joins the Caracol. A way has been opened through this mountain which leads to Guaranda or Guayaquil ; but it is passable in the summer only. There is also another pass equally difficult and dangerous, called vlngas. The cold is great at the top of the mountain, and at the skirts the heat is excessive. It is  in lat. 44' s.  3l2   444    

==[[Chimalapa|CHIMALAPA]]==, Santa Maria de, a settlement of the head settlement of the district and eJcaldia mayor of Tehuantepec in Nueva Espana.

C111==[[Amlhuacan|AMLHUACAN]]==, a settlement of the head settlement and alcaldia mayor of Coatepec in Nueva Espana. It contains a good convent of the religious order of St. Donfingo, 300 families of Spaniards, Mtistees, and Mulattoes, who employ themselves in labour, and in the commerce of seeds and large and small cattle, which are bred in the estates contiguous ; but the latter in no great degree, owing to the scarcity of water and pasture which prevails here. Chimalhuacan, another settlement and head settlement of the district in the alcaldia mayor of Chalco, of the same kingdom. It contains 166 families of Indians, and a convent of the religious order of St. Domingo. Five leagues n. of its capital. 

==[[Chimaltenango|CHIMALTENANGO]]==, a province and corregimiento of the kingdom of Guatemala ; situate in the valley of this capital. . It is very pleasant and fertile, and peopled with Indians. 
==[[Chimaltepec|CHIMALTEPEC]]==, a settlement of the alcaldia mayor of TIapa in Nueva Espana, It contains 29 families of Indians, and r^ two leagues from the real of the mines of Cairo. Chimaltepec, another small settlement of the head settlement of Malcatepec, and alcaldia mayor of Nexapa, very near its head settlement. 

==[[Chiman|CHIMAN]]==, a settlement of the province and government of Darien, in the kingdom of Tierra Firme ; situate near the coast of the S. sea, and on the shore of the river of its name, having a small port, which is garrisoned by a detachment from Panama, for the purpose of restraining the invasions which are continually made by the Indians. Chiman, a river of this province and government, which rises in the mountains on the 5. coast, and runs into the sea opposite the island of Narranjal. 

CHIMB A, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Coquimbo in, the kingdom of Chile. It has the celebrated talc goldmine which was discovered 36 years ago by a fisherman, who pulling up a plant of large and prickly leaves, called cardon, or fuller's thistle, for the purpose of fuel for his fire, observed that particles of gold dropped from its roots; and having more narrowly inspected it, found pieces amidst the mould of conbiderable size and of \ery fine quality. Thus  a mine became established here, and when it was first dug it yielded from 300 to 50*0 dollars each caxon. 
Chimb a, another settlement of the province and corregimiento of Caxatambo in Peru ; annexed to the curacy of Andajes. 

==[[Chimbacalle|CHIMBACALLE|San Juan Evaxg?- eista]]==, a settlement of the kingdom of Quito, in the corregimiento of the district of Las Cinco Leguasde la Capital, (of the Five Leagues from the Capital), of which this is looked upon as a suburb from its proximity. 
==[[Chimbarongo|CHIMBARONGO]]==, a river of the kingdom of Chile. It rises in the mountains of its cordillera, and unites itself Avith that of Tinguiragua to enter the Napel. This river waters and fertilizes some very pleasant and delightful valleys, abounding in pastures, whereon breed and fatten an infinite number of cattle. On its shores are two convents, one of the religious order of Nuestra Seiiora dela Merced, for the instruction of the Indians in the Christian faith ; and another a house for novices, which belonged to the regulars of the society of Jesuits; and also within a league's distance from the latter, is a convent of the order of St. Domingo. Chimbarongo, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Colchagua in the same kingdom ; situate in the former valley, between the rivers Tinguiririca and Teno. There is also another small settlement annexed, with a chapel of ease. In its district is a convent of the religious order of La Merced. 

[==[[Chimbo|CHIMBO]]==, a jurisdiction in the province of Zinto in South America, in the torrid zone. The capital is also called by the same name.] Chimbo y Alausi, a province and corregimiento of the kingdom of Quito ; bounded n. by the serrania of the asiento of Ambato ; s. by the government and jurisdiction of Guayaquil ; e. by the district of the point of Santa Elena of this government; and w. by the province of Riobamba. Its district is barren and poor, and the country being mountainous, the inhabitants have no resource for getting their livelihood other than by acting as carriers between the provinces of Riobamba and Tacunga on the one hand^ and the warehouses of Babahoyo on the other, where also are the royal magazines ; and thus they bring back goods from the provinces of Peru, having for this traffic a number of requas, or droves of mules, amounting in the whole to 1500 head. This commerce can only be carried on in the summer, the roads being impassable in the winter through the mountains, when they say that these are shut up : atthe same season the rivers besome swollen to such a degree    

CHI  as to render it impracticable to cross them. In the road they usually take lies the steep declivity of San Antonio, extremely difficult to be passed. The mules however are so well versed in the manner of" letting themselves slide down it, that there has never been an instance of these animals falling. The vegetable productions of this province are confined to bark, and from this no emolument is derived, although it was discovered, after much search and solicitude, by the Lieutenantcolonel Don Miguel deSantistevan. It accord inghy provides itself with all that it may require in this way from the adjoining provinces of Riobamba and Tacunga. It is of a very cold temperature, from its being so near to the mountainous desert of Chimborazo. Its natives amount to 2000 souls, the greater ;part of them being Mustees, and the whole are divided into seven settlements, of which the capital bears the same name ; and although this was formerly the residence of the corregidor, yet has it of late been deserted for the settlement of Guaranda. The seven settlements are, San Lorenzo, Guaranda, 
Asancoto, Guanujo, 
Chapacoto, Tomabelas. 
San Miguel, ==[[Chimborazo|CHIMBORAZO|Chimbokasu]]==, a very lofty mountain or desert of the cordillera of the province and corregimiento of Riobamba, in the kingdom of Quito; which, in the language of the country, signifies mountain of the other side. It is covered with everlasting snow, and is the loftiest mountain in the known world, since its height, taken by the academicians of the sciences of Paris, is 3220 toises from the level of the sea to its top, which terminates in a cone or truncated pyramid. Its sides are covered with a kind of white sand or calcined earth with loose stones, and a certain herb called pajon, which affords pasture for the cattle of the neighbouring estates. The warm streams flowing from its n. side should seem to warrant the idea that within it is a volcano. From its top flow down many rivers, which take different winding courses ; thus the Guaranda runs s. the Guano s. e. and the Machala e. On its skirt lies the road which leads from Quito to Guayaquil ; and in order to pass it in safety, it is requisite to be more cautious in choosing the proper season than were the Spanish conquerors of this province, who were here frozen to death. North of the town of Riobamba, in lat. 1° 21' 18" s. according to the observations of M. La Condamine. ("This mountain was visited, on the 23d of June 1797, by Humboldt; who with his party reached its e. slope on that day, and planted their instru-  ments on a narrow ledge of porphyritic rock which projected from the vast field of un fat homed snow. A chasm, 500 feet wide, prevented their further ascent. The air was reduced to half its usual density, and felt intensely cold and piercing. Respiration was laborious, and blood oozed from their eyes, their lips and their gums. They stood on the highest spot evert.«od by man. Its height, ascertained from barometrical observation, was 3485 feet greater than the elevation attained in 1745 by Condamine, and 19,300 feet above the level of the sea. From that extreme station, the top of Chimborazo was found," by trigonometrical measurement, to be 2140 feet still higher.

CH1QUIMULA y Sacapa, a province and alcaldia mayor of the kingdom of Guatemala. 

CHIQU1NQU1RA, a settlement of the corregimiento of Tunja in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada. It is of a cold temperature, but is healthy ; its situation is delightful, and it abounds in productions. It is watered by a river which runs through the centre of it, the waters of which are unwholesome : at a small distance another river passes through a plain ; this is called Balsa, or Raft, since, before the bridge was thrown across it, it was passed by rafts. It rises from the lake Fuguene, and abounds in most exquisite fish. The settlement,, which was formerly but small, is now of great note, and its inhabitants are about 500, besides 70 Indians. It has a good convent of the religious order of S. Domingo, and is noted for the sanctuary of the virgin of its title. Under the large altar, at which is placed this image, there is a small fountain of water, renowned for the curing of infirmities, as is also the earth which is extracted from thence; it being by no means the least part of the prodigy, that although this earth has been constantly taken out for upwards of 200 years, the excavation formed thereby is comparatively exceedingly small. The faith in, and devotion towards this image, are throughout the kingdom very great, and not less so with regard to strangers, who visit it in great numbers from far distant provinces. This settlement is nine leagues from Tunja, and 15 to the n. w. of Santa Fe. 

CH1==[[Quiti|QUITI]]==, a river of the province and government of Esmeraldas in the kingdom of Quito^ It runs from s. no. to n. e. between the rivers Vichi and Cuche, and enters on the s. side into the river of Las Esmeraldas. 
==[[Chiquitoi|CHIQUITOI]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of T/uxillo in Peru. It is at present destroyed, and the few surviving inhabitants afterwards collected together at the settlement of Santiago de Cao, and it then became merely a small estate or hamlet, preserving its original name, and being inhabited by a few Indians. 
==[[Chiquitos|CHIQUITOS]]==, a numerous and warlike nation of Indians of Peru, whose country or territory extends from lat. 16° to 20° s. It is bounded w. by the province and government of Santa Cruz de la Sierra ; on the e. it extends itself for upwards of 140 leagues as far as the lake of Los Xarayes ; on, the n. as far as the mountains of the Tapacures, the which divide this country from that of Moxos ;  CHI  on the *. as far as the mountains of Los Zamncos, having in this part a level territory of upwards of 40 leagues long, covered with forests, and in which is found abundance of wild cinnamon trees, honey, wax, resins, .and precious balsams ; numbers of stags, tigers, bears, wild boars, and various other quadrupeds and venomous reptiles. This country is watered by many rivers, which flow down from the mountains, and run from e. to w. forming large lakes, which abound in excellent fish, and particularly in tortoises. The climate is very hot and moist : the natives are of a good stature, well made and robust, but extremely indolent. They obtained the name of chiquitos, or little, from the Spaniards, who upon their first arrival in the country were struck with the lowness of their doors or entrances into their houses, it being necessary to crawl in and out of them on all fours : this is a plan they seen, to have adopted as a precaution against the attacks of their enemies and wild beasts. Their country was first entered by Nuflo de Chaves in 1557; and npon an attempt to reduce it to the dominion of Spain, the inhabitants maintained a long and bloody conflict against the Spaniards until the year 1690,when, induced by the preaching of the regulars of the company of the Jesuits, they embraced the Catholic faith, became reduced to the laws of civil society, and were divided into settlements, which these zealous ministers of the gospel contrived, not without incredible exertion and fatigue, to maintain undisturbed until 1767, when they were supplanted in their functions by the secular clergy. The Portuguese of San Pablo have taken away numbers of these Indians to work in their estates, and this is one of the principal causes of their apparent diminution, since they were at first innumerable. They are composed of the following nations  Picocas, 
Punajicas, 
Quimecas, 
Huapacas, 
Baurecas, 
Payconecas, 
Huaravos, 
Anaporecas, 
Meriponecas,

All of these nations speak a different language, but are now united into settlements, having one idiom which is familiar to them all ; although this is extremely difficult, the acquisition of it having puzzled the missionaries, who were engaged in its study for 9 or 10 years or upwards: besides the guttural letters, and those whose sound is given by the palate, teeth, and lips, this language has others, the pronunciation of which is given entirely through the nose; the dialect also of the men differs from that of the women. The continual moisture which is prevalent here, together with the multitude of trees, which stand so thick as to impede the free circulation of the air, are the causes why this country is peculiarly subject to epidemic disorders, which carry away immense numbers of its inhabitants ; as happened in the year 1768, when, out of 24,000 inhabitants, more than 4000 perished. They suffer much also from crickets, which disturb their rest and destroy their clothes. Here are also an infinite variety of spiders, some of which, are as large as a man's fist, which live in holes, and others of a smaller sort, which make their web among trees, in so strong a manner as to arrest a man on horseback in his passage : some there are of a very small sort, whose colour is red, and whose web is yellow and as soft as silk, but whose bite is so venomous, that the body of the person bitten immediately swells all over, and this is followed by a flux of blood from the mouth, nostrils, eyes, and nails ; though by means of these violent emotions, the poison itself is sometimes evacuated. In the woods are found .a great variety of monkeys; some with long beards, and so large and ugly as to strike even the natives with horror. It has been observed, that the people of this province seldom exceed 60 years in age, and that their life is extremely dissipated ; taking at the same time into consideration the excessive perspiration and debility caused by their aliments, for the very meat they eat is flabby and insipid, on account of the cattle seldom'thriving or growing fat : but with all their disadvantages of food and climate, there never was seen amongst them a blind, dumb, foolish, or any otherwise defective person. The settlements are regularly built, forming wide and straight streets with a square and large marketplace. The furniture of the houses is comprised in a cotton hammoc, and some cups and dishes, and the ornament in some maize and 3 M  lte*«   450  CHI  dried flesh, hung up to preserve them from corruption. Their garments are a shirt without sleeves, reaching down to the middle of their legs. The married people wear drawers of baize with coloured puckers for festival days, and those who enjoy offices of state wear a baize jacket : they neither use hatnorsboes, and no one of them ever goes out without slinging round his neck some medals and a rosary. The hair is worn short until they marry, and when they become old they suffer it to grow long. The women wear close gowns which reach down to the ground, and which they call tapoyes: they never swathe or bind themselves round the waist, but carry on their necks, on galadays, some threads strung with glass intermixed with beads made of cacao nuts, and coloured beans ; these threads usually amount to 20 or SO rows : on entering the church tbey always loosen their hair. The regulars of the company of the Jesuits taught them offices, in which they assisted most dexterously ; and it really excites admiration that Indians, acquainted only with their own barbarian dialect, should be able to manage the compass of the notes, understand their proportions and numbers, and apply the rules of music to its execution. At certain times of the year they go a 7nelear, or to hunt for honey among the woods : from thence they bring back wax of two sorts, one which is white and odoriferous, j,he other of less substance, as the wax of Europe, manufactured by a species of bees without stings, called opernus; also another kind of wax, made by a still different sort of bees, but which are all properly denominated wild wax. This wax is delivered to the curate, who preserves it in his house to send to the provinces of Peru ; and from the product of this article, and from that of the cotton, which is made into woofs, to the amount of two pounds weight yearly by each Indian, he procures in exchange whatever is necessary for the settlement, such as baizes, coloured wools, bags, iron and steel articles, chopping knives, wedges, hatchets, scissars, pocketknives, needles, medals, bugles, and other articles of hardware and little necessaries, which, being stored up by him, is distributed amongst the natives accordino - to their necessities, and in a manner that they may want for nothing, but live happy and contented. The settlements are as follows : 
San Xavier, San Joseph, 
La Concepcion, Santiago, 
San Miguel, San Juan, 
San Ignacio, El Santo, 
Santa Ana, Corazon. 
San Rafael, CHIQU1ZA, a settlement of the corregimienio  of Sachica in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada.

==[[Chire|CHIRE]]==, Santa Rosa de, a city of the government and province of Los Llanos in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada ; founded by the Governor Francisco" Anciso. It is of a very hot and unhealthy temperature, but affords the same vegetable productions as the rest of the province. It is so mean and reduced as to contain hardly 100 housekeepers, and scarcely deserves the name of a city. This settlement lies the furthest to the n. vs. extremity of any in this kingdom, and is bounded in that quarter by the province and bishopric of Caracas. Chi re, Santa Rosa de, a river of the above province and government. It rises at the foot of the lomas del Viento, runs e. and enters the Meta, traversing the country of the Betoyes Indians.

CH1R1==[[Coas|COAS]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, to the e. of the mountains of Bogota, and at the entrance of the llanos or plains of Cazanare and Meta. They lead a wandering life through the woods in company with the Guaibas ; they are crafty and very dexterous thieves, but of a docile and pacific disposition. In 1664 some of them were reduced into  a settlement founded seven leagues from the place called the Puerto, but in 1668 they fled, all of them, to the mountains, although in the same year they returned back again to the settlement. 
CH1==[[Riguana|RIGUANA]]==, a large settlement of the province and government of Santa Marta in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada. It is of an hot temperature, and the territory is level, fertile, and beautiful. It has besides the parish church a convent or house of entertainment of the religious order of St. Francis. 
==[[Chiriguanos|CHIRIGUANOS]]==, a country and nation of the infidel Indians of the province and government of Santa Cruz de la Sierra in Peru, from whence it lies 20 leagues to the s. It is bounded on the e. by the province of Tomina, and s. e. by that of Chuquisaca ; is composed of different settlements, each governed by its captain or cazique, subject, in a certain degree, to the above government. These people, though they refuse to adopt the Catholic religion, are in perfect amity with the Spaniards, trading with them in wax, cotton,' and maize. This nation, by the incursions which they made, used at first to give frequent alarm to the province, and once had the address to capture the city of Chiquisaca. The Inca Yupanqui endeavoured in vain to subdue them, and neither he nor the Spaniards could avail aught with them nntil they were reduced by the missionaries, the regulars of the extinguished company of the Jesuits ; since that time they have been stedfast in supporting the Spaniards against the other infidels, serving them as a barrier, and having for their own line of defence the river Guapay. They are very valorous, but inconstant and faithless ; they are descended from the nations which are found to the e. of Paraguay ; and fled from thence, to the number of 4000, when avoiding the threatened chastisement of the Portuguese, who were about to inflict condign punishment on them for having treacherously murdered the Captain Alexo Garcia in the time of the King Don Juan III. of Portugal. They were formerly cannibals, and used to fatten their prisoners that these might become better fare ; but their intercourse and trade with the Spaniards has caused them by degrees to forget this barbarous practice, and even to give them a disgust at their savage neighbours, who still continue in the same practices. They are at the present day so greatly increased in numbers, that they are one of the most numerous nations of America ; are besides very neat and clean ; and it is not uncommon for them to rush out of their dwellings in the middle of the night to plunge and wash themselves in a river in the most severe seasons ; their wives too,    immediately after parturition, invariably do the same, and on their return lay themselves on a heap of sand, which they have for this purpose in the house; but the husband immediately takes to his bed, and being covered all over with very large leaves, refuses to take any other nourishment than a little broth made of maize ; it being an incorrigible error of belief amongst them that these ceremonies will be the cause of making their children bold and warlike. They have shewn great power and address in their combats with our troops when these first endeavoured to enter their territories, and they threw themselves in such an agile and undaunted manner upon our firearms that it was found necessary, on our part, to insert in the ranLs a lanceman between every two fusileers : they are, moreover, so extremely,nimble that it is impossible to take them prisoners but by surprise.

The whole of this province abounds in woods and mountains, and is crossed by a chain of the Andes, which run as far as the isthmus of Panama. It is watered by several rivers and streams, all of which run w. and enter the S. sea. The districts of Citara and Raposo form a part of this province ; very few of their ancient inhabitants remain at the present day ; the greater part of them having perished in the war of the   454    Spaniards, and the rest having fled, and thus penetrating n. have confounded themselves with other nations. It abounds in maize, plantains, and cacao of an excellent quality ; its gold mines render it rich and well peopled ; it also carries on, through this branch of revenue, a great commerce witli the province of Popayan, the natives of that place coming here to purchase gold, and leaving in exchange whatever is necessary for the comfort and convenience of life. There is no inconsiderable number of Negro slaves employed in working the mines, and in 1750 they amounted to 20,000, without mentioning the men of colour, suchastheA/wsfcesand Mulattoes, and even Whites who are engaged in this lucrative concern. The climate is warm, but moist from the continual rains, and consequently unhealthy. This country abounds in tigers, wild boars, alligators, parrots, monkeys of various sorts, and a multitude of reptiles and insects, especially in vipers and venomous snakes ; such as corales, cxis, and rattlesnakes. Here are also an infinite variety of beautiful sorts of wood, curious balsams, herbs, fruits, and flowers. It was subject to the government of Popayan, until it became divided in the time of Don Fernando Guerrero. All the gold which is taken out of the mines here, and which is the current money, was formerly carried to be coined at the mint of Santa Fe, until that the house of Valencia established another, at its own cost, in the city of Popayan ; this privilege having been first granted that house by the mayoralty, though it was afterwards taken away and added by the king to the crown, upon the payment of a compensation of 100,000 reals per annum to the original proprietors. This province extends 48 leagues from s. to n. and is 39 in width from e. to w. The capital is the city of Nevita. 
[Choco, Canal of.

A monk of great activity, cure of the village, of Novita, employed his parishioners to dig a small canal in the ravine De la Raspadura, by means of which, when the rains are abundant, canoes loaded with cacao pass from sea to sea. This interior communication has existed since 1788, unknown in Europe. The small canal of Raspadura unites, on the coasts of the two oceans,   two points 75 leagues distant from one another.]

==[[Chocona|CHOCONA]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Paria in Peru ; annexed to the curacy of Toledo. 
==[[Choconta|CHOCONTA]]==, a settlement of the corregimiento of Guatavita in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada. It is of a cold but healthy temperature, being situate upon a llanura. It produces abundance of wheat, maize, papas, barley, and garlic, of the whole of which an abundant crop is gathered; these indeed form the principal branches of its commerce, as they supply all the neighbouring provinces. It was in the time of the Indians a large, rich, and populous city, and the barrier of the province of Tunja ; also the place where the zipas held a garrison of their best troops. This city was entered by Gonzalo Ximinez de Quesada in 1537, when he gave it the name of Espiritu Santo, from this festival having been celebrated here. After the conquest of the Spaniards it became a became a curacy of the religion of St. Domingo, and was one of those whichwas considered the first step to the advantages to be derived from these missions. It was close to this settlement that the sanguinary conflict took place which was fought between Michua, king of Tunja and Saguanmachica, zipa or king of Bogota, in which both princes fell dead upon the field ; at present it is a small village of Indians, who amount to the number of 200, besides 400 other inhabitants, who consist of whites.

==[[Chocope|CHOCOPE]]==, San Pedro y San Pablo, de, .a small settlement of the province and corregimiento of Truxillo in Peru ; situate in the valley of Chicama, watered and fertilized by the river of this name. It produces in abundance grapes, sugarcanes, olives, and every kind of European fruit of the most excellent flavour. It was formerly a large population, since that the few inhabitants who had been left at Concepcion, and those of Licapa in the same valley, have incorporated themselves here. It has a very large and handsome church, although this underwent some damage from an earthquake experienced in this province in 1759 ; the settlement suffered much also in 1726, as did all the other towns of the coast, as, very contrary to the custom of the climate here, it rained without cessation for a period of 40 days, from five o'clock in the evening to the same hour in the following morning, so that the houses were almost all entirely destroyed. It is 10 leagues from the capital, in the royal road which leads to Lima, and which is called De Valles. Lat. 7° 52' *.

Cholula, Tlaxclala, and Huetxocingo, are the three republics which resisted the Mexican yoke for so many centuries, although the pernicious aristocracy of their  C H O  constitution left the lower people little move freedom than they would have possessed under the government of the Aztec kings.] 
The capital is the city of the same name, founded as far back as the time of the gentilism of the Mexican empire, when this nation was at enmity with that of Chichiraeca ; it was then one of the most populous cities, and contained 30,000 inhabitants and 300 temples, and served as a barrier to Moctezuma, in the attack against the republic of Tlaxclala; the latter place never having been subjected to the Mexican yoke. This was the city which of all others most thwarted the designs of Hernan Cortes, but the inhabitants were discovered in the conspiracy they had laid against him, when they pretended to receive him with open arms and a peaceable and friendly disposition, and were made by him to suffer severely for their hypocrisy ; after which he and his whole army escaped uninjured. This city has many monuments denoting its antiquity; and although in ancient times idolatry was here carried to its highest pitch, yet the light of the gospel has spread widely around its enlivening rays. It is of a mild and healthy temperature, rather inclined to cold than heat, being situate on a level, fertile, and beautiful plain. It has a good convent of the order of St. Francis, which is also a house of studies. Its inhabitants are composed of 50 families of Spaniards, 458 of Mustees, Mulattoes and Negroes, and 606 of Indians. On a lofty spot which lies close to the entrance, on the e. side of the city, is a handsome chapel, in which is venerated the image of the blessed virgin, which also bears the dedicatory title of Los Kernedios. It is a little more than 20 leagues to the e. of Mexico, and four from Tlaxclala. Long. 98° 14'. Lat. 19° 4'. [Its population is at present estimated at about 16,000 souls.]

==[[Chones|CHONES]]==, a large river of the province of Cara in the kingdom of Quito.

Its mouth is nearly two miles and an half wide. ==[[Chones|CHONGO]]==, San Miguel de, a settlement of  the alcaldia mayor of Huamelula. It is of a very cold temperature, from its being situate in the vicinity of the sierra Nevada (or Snowy) of the Chontales, which lies on the n. side of it. Its inhabitants amount to 24 families of Indians, who trade in cochineal, seeds, and fruits, of which the country, being naturally luxuriant, produces great quantities. It is watered by rivers which pass at a little distance, and is annexed to the curacy of Tepaltepec of the jurisdiction and alcaldia mayor of Nexapa, from whence it lies 20 leagues. It is, on account of this great distance, combined with the badness of the roads, that the natives so seldom can avail themselves of any instruction in the holy faith ; dying, as they often do, without the administration of the sacraments. Indeed, there is only one day in the year, which is the 29th of September, and on which the Indians celebrate the festival of their titular saint Michael, when they are visited by their curate, who then hears their confessions and says mass. At this time this settlement has somewhat the appearance of a Catholic people; but being all the rest of the year left to themselves, it is not to be wondered that many relapse into their pristine state of gentilism and idolatry.

It is of a hot but healthy temperature, produces abundance of sugarcanes, of which are made honey, sugar, and conserves, in immense quantities ; also a great proportion of smoking tobacco, which is carried to Maracaibo. It has a good church and a convent of St. Augustin, which latter has fallen much to decay with regard to its establishment. The pofiulation of the town consists of 400 housekeepers, t lies 20 leagues n. e. of Pamplona, from the jurisdiction of which it is divided by the river Pamplonilla. It is the native place of Don Gregorio de Jaimes, archdeacon of Santa Fe, and bishop of Santa Marta. Chuistovai/, San, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Lipes, archbishopric of Charcas in Peru ; in which took place the following extraordinary occurrence : The curate of this place going to confess a sick person in the settlement of Tahisa of the province of Paria, which was annexed to this, sunk into a spring of water in the pampas or llanos dela Sal, when he was drowned, and with the two Indians who accompanied him on horseback, never more appeared, nor were any vestiges ever found of them : this was the reason why the latter settlement has since been disunited from the curacy of San Christoval. 
Christoval, San, a capital city of the province and captainship of Sergipe in the kingdom of Brazil ; being also known by that name. It is founded on the seashore, and has a fine and well defended port. It has a magnificent parish church with the title of Nuestra Senora de la Victoria ; two fine convents, the one of the order of the Franciscans, and the other of the Carmelites ; also a chapel of devotion of the Virgin of the Rosary. The councilhouse is a very fine edifice, and in the suburbs is a hermitage of San Gonzalo, which is frequented, as a pilgrimage by this and other settlements of the jurisdiction. In this city resides the chief captain, who governs this province, and who is attended by a company of troops as a bodyguard. In early times it was filled with nobility, descended from the first families in Portugal ; but it is now reduced to 500 housekeepers. In its district, towards the part called Coninquiva, is a parish with four chapels, and towards the river Vaza-Barris five  45£  others. It has also 25 engines, by which abundance of sugar of an excellent quality is manufactured ; this article affords a great commerce with the bay of Todos Santos. Lat. 11° 40' s. Long. 37° 30' w. Christoval, San, an island of the N. sea ; one of the Antilles, discovered by Admiral Christopher Columbus, who gave it his name, in 1493. It is five leagues in circumference, and is very fertile, and abounding in productions, particularly in cotton, tobacco, indigo, sugar, and brandy ; by all of which it carries on a great commerce. Here ar&lt;r some good salines, and in the mountains are some woods of fine timber, well adapted for the building of ships. The English and the French both established themselves here in 1625, holding a divided possession, when they were driven out by the Spaniards. After this the former again returned and reestablished themselves in the greatest part of the island, leaving, however, a small share to the French, until the year 1713, when the latter, in conjunction with the Spaniards themselves, ceded it entirely to the English, who from that time have held it and kept it well fortified. [St. Christopher, situate in lat. 17° 21', long. 62° 48' w. tf as called by its ancient possessors, the Charibes^Liamuiga, or the Fertile Island. It was discovered in .November 1493 by Columbus himself, who Was so pleased with its appearance, that he honoured it with his own Christian name. But it was neither planted nor possessed by the Spaniards. It was, however, (notwithstanding that the general opinion ascribes the honour of seniority to Barbadoes), the eldest of all the British territories in the W. Indies, and in truth, the common mother both of the English and French settlements in the Charibean islands. A Mr. Thomas Warner, an Englishman, associated himself with 14 other persons in the year 
1622, and with them took his passage on board a ship bound to Virginia. From thence he and his companions sailed from St. Christopher's, where they arrived in January 1623, and by the month of September following had raised a good crop of tobacco, which they proposed to make their staple commodity. By the generality of historians who have treated of the affairs of the W. Indies, it is asserted that a party of the French, under the command of a person of the name of D'Esnambuc, took possession of one part of this island, on the same day that Mr. Warner landed on the other; but the truth is, that the first landing of Warner and his associates happened two years before the arrival of D'Esnambuc ; who, it is admitted by Du Tertre, did not leave France until 1625. Unfortunately the English settlers, in the latter end of 
1623, had their plantations demolished by a dread-"]

[ful hurricane, which put a sudden stop to their progress. In consequence of this calamity, Mr. Warner returned to England to implore succour ; and it was on that occasion that he sought and obtained the powerful patronage and support of James Hay, Earl of Carlisle. This nobleman caused a ship to be fitted out, laden with all kinds of necessaries. It was called the Hopewell ; and arrived at St. Christopher's on the 18th of May 1624 ; and thus he certainly preserved a settlement which had otherwise died in its infancy. Warner himself did not return to St. Christoper's until the year following. He was then accompanied by a large body of recruits, and D'Esnambuc arrived about the same time, perhaps the same day. This latter was the captain of a French privateer ; and having, in an engagment with a Spanish galleon of superior strength, been very roughly handled, he was obliged, after losing several of his men, to seek refuge in these islands. He brought with him to St. Christopher's about thirty hardy veterans, and they were cordially received by the English, who appear at this time to have been under some apprehensions of the Charibes. Hitherto Warner's first colony had lived on friendly terms with these poor savages, by whom they were liberally supplied with provisions ; but having seized on their lands, the consciousness of deserving retaliation made the planters apprehensive of an attack, when probably none was intended. Du Tertre relates, that the French and English receiving information of a projected revolt, concurred in a scheme for seizing the conspirators beforehand. Accordingly they fell on the Charibes by night, and having murdered in cold blood from 100 to 120 of the stoutest, drove all the rest from the island, except such of the women as were young and handsome, of whom, says the reverend historian, they made concubines and slaves. Such is the account of a contemporary author, Pere Du Tertre, who relates these transactions with perfect composure, as founded on common usage, and not unwarrantable in their nature. He adds, that such of the Charibes as escaped the massacre, having given the alarm to their countrymen in the neighbouring islands, a large body of them returned soon afterwards, breathing revenge ; and now the conflict became serious. The Europeans, however, more from the superiority of their weapons, than of their valour, became conquerors in the end ; but their triumph was dearly purchased, 100 of their number having been left dead on the field of battle. After this exploit, which Du Tertre calls a glorious victory, the Charibes appear to have quitted altogether this and some of the small islands in the  neighbourhood, and to have retired southwards. The two leaders, Warner and D'Esnambuc, about the same time, found it necessary to return to Europe for the purpose of soliciting succour from their respective nations ; and bringing with them the name of conquerors, they severally met with all possible encouragement. Warner was knighted by his sovereign, and through the interest of his noble patron sent back as governor in 1626, with 400 new recruits, amply supplied with necessaries of all kinds; while D'Esnambuc, under the patronage of Richlieu, (the minister of France), projected the establishment of an exclusive company for trading to this and some of the other islands. That minister concurred with D'Esnambuc in opinion, that such an institution was best adapted to the purposes of commerce and colonization ; an erroneous conclusion, which D'Esnambuc himself had soon abundant occasion to lament ; for the French in general either misunderstood or disapproved the project. Subscriptions came in reluctantly, and the ships which the new company fitted out on this occasion, were so wretchedly supplied with provisions and necessaries, that of 532 recruits, who sailed from France with D'Esnambuc, in February 1627, the greater part perished miserably at sea for want of food. 
The English received the survivors with compassion and kindness ; and for preventing contests in future about their respective limits, the commanders of each nation agreed to divide the whole island pretty equally between their followers. A treaty of partition for this purpose was reduced to writing, and signed, with many formalities, on the third of May 1627. The island was invaded by the Spaniards in 1629 ; after this there took place a serious contest between the English and the French possessors ; and the conduct of the latter on this occasion was deemed so cruel and treacherous, that it was assigned by King William and Queen Mary among the causes which induced them to declare war against the French nation. Even fortune herself, inclining at length to the side of justice, from henceforward deserted them ; for, after they had continued about eight months sole masters of the island, the English under the command of General Codrington, returning in great force, not only compelled the French inhabitants to surrender, but actually transported 1800 of them to Martinico and llispaniola. It is true, that reparation was stipulated to be made them by the treaty of Ryswic, m 1697; but war again breaking out between the two nations, in 1702j the French planters derived but little ad-]  r~,

[vantage from that clause in their favour. They had, however, in 1705, the gloomy satisfaction to behold many of the English possessions again laid waste by a French armament, which committed such ravages, that the British parliament found it necessary to distribute the sum of 103,000/. among the sufferers, to enable them to resettle their plantations. Happily this was the last exertion of national enmity and civil discord within this little community; for at the peace of Utrecht, the island was ceded wholly to the English, and the French possessions publicly sold for the benefit of the English government. In 1733, 80,000/. of the money was appropriated as a marriage portion with the Princess Anne, who was betrothed to the Prince of Orange. Some few of the French planters, indeed, who consented to take the oaths, were naturalized, and permitted to retain their estates. Such were the origin and progress of the British establishment in the island of St. Christopher. The glorious circumstances which attended the French invasion in the beginning of 1782, when a garrison of less than 1000 effective men (including the militia) was attacked by 8000 of the best disciplined troops of France,'' supported by a fleet of 32 ships of war ; the consequent surrender of the island, after a most vigorous and noble defence ; and its restoration to Great Britain by the general peace of 1783, will long be in the recollection of every Englishman ; but we cannot forbear to put it upon record, that at the siege of Brimstone hill, the enemy's batteries, consisting of 24 mortars and 23 pieces of heavy artillery, were continually, for five weeks and 34 days, firing on a spot of ground where the greatest diameter was not more than 200 yards, before the British would surrender^-that Rodney's celebrated victory took place on the 12th of April 1782, lasting from seven in the morning to half past six in the evening, when five ships, commanded by the Count de Grasse, -were taken, another sunk, and the admiral himself made prisoner. 
This island is divided into nine parishes, and contains four towns and hamlets, viz. Basseterre, (the present capital, as it was formerly that of the French, containing about 800 houses), Sandypoint, Oldroad, and Deepbay. Of these, the two first are ports of entry,established by law. The fortifications consist of Charlesfort and Brimsonehill, both near Sandypoint; three batteries at Basseterre, one at Figtreebay, another at Palmetopoint, and some smaller ones of no great importance. The proportion which St. Christopher's contributes, with the other islands, towards an honourable provision for the governorgeneral, is 1000/. currency per ann. which is settled on him by the as-  sembly immediately on his arrival. He has besides some perquisites ; and in time of war they are considerable. Each island within this government has a separate council, and each of them an assembly, or house of representatives. In St. Christopher's, the council should consist of 10 members, but it is seldom that more than seven are present. The house of assembly is composed of 24 representatives, of whom 15 make a quorum. The requisite qualification js a freehold of 40 acres of land, or a house worth 40/. a year. Of the electors, the qualification is a freehold of 10/. per ami. Its government is comprehended under the title of that of the Leeward Charibean islands. The governor of this and the other islands in the same government is chancellor by his office, and in St. Christopher's sits alone. In this island, as in Jamaica, the jurisdiction of both the king's bench and common pleas centres in one superior court, wherein justice is administered by a chiefjustice and four puisne judges. The chief is appointed by the crown, the others by the governor in the king's name, and they all hold their commissions during pleasure. The office of chief judge is worth about 600/. per ann. The emoluments of the assistant judges are trifling. St. Christopher's is about 14 leagues in circuit, and contains 43,726 acres of land, of which about 17,000 acres are appropriated to the growth of sugar, and 4000 to pasturage. As sugar is the only commodity of any account that is raised, except provisions and a little cotton, it is probable, that nearly onehalf the whole island is unfit for cultivation. The interior part of the country consists indeed of many rugged precipices and barren mountains. Of these the loftiest is mount Misery, (evidently a decayed volcano), which rises 3711 feet in perpendicular height from the sea. Nature, however, has made abundant amends for the sterility of the mountains by the fertility she has bestowed upon the plains. No part of the W. Indies possesses even the same species of soil that is found in St. Christopher's. It is in general a dark grey loam, so light and porous as to be penetrable by the slightest application of the hoe. It is thought to be the production of subterraneous fires, the black ferruginous pumice of naturalists, finely incorporated with a pure loam or virgin mould. The understratum is gravel, from eight to 12 inches deep. Clay is no where found, except at a considerable height in the mountains. Canes, planted in particular spots, have been known to yield 8000 lbs. of Muscovado sugar from a single acre. One gentleman, in a favourable season, made 6400 lbs. or four hogsheads of 16 cwt. each per acre, on au average return of his]    462

[whole crop. It is not, however, pretended that the greatest part, or even a very large proportion, of the cane land throughout the island, is equally productive. The general average produce for a series of years is 16,000 hogsheads of J 6 cwt. which, as onehalf only of the whole cane land, or 8500 acres, is annually cut, (the remainder being in young canes), gives nearly two hogsheads of 16 cwt. per acre for the whole of the land in ripe canes; but even this is a prodigious return, not equalled, perhaps, by any other sugar country in any part of the globe. 
In the report of the privy council in 1788, the British property vested here is estimated at 43,726  acres of patented estates, and 26,000 Negroes, at 50/. each Negro. The same report, in a general appraisement of British property vested in the British colonies, makes the land, buildings, and stock, double the value of the Negroes ; and the towns, stores, and shipping about r \ of the land, &amp;c. In 1770 the exports amounted to above 419,000/. sterling, in sugar, molasses, and rum ; and near 8000/. for cotton. Besides cotton, ginger, and the tropical fruits, it produced, in 1787, 231,397 cwt. of sugar ; and in 1790, but about 1 13,000 cwt. The produce of this article varies from 8000 to 17,000 hogsheads of 13 cwt.  
By return to house of commons, 1806, the Exports of Sugar from St. Christopher's amounted, 
In 1789, to 11,000 hogsheads of 13 cwt. 1799, to 9,900 do. 1805, to 26,000 do.

As in the other British islands in the neighbourhood, all the white men from the age of 16 to 60 are obliged to enlist in the milita, and in this island they serve without pay. They form two regiments of foot, although the whole number of effective men in each regiment seldom exceeds 300 ; but there is likewise a company of free blacks, and this, before the late war, constituted the whole of the military force within the island. Indeed, its natural strength, from the conformation and inequalities of its furface, is such, that a garrison of 2000 effective troops, properly supplied with am-  munition and provisions, would in all human probability render it impregnable to the most formidable invasion. 
The Gazette of November 1st, 1811, contains what has hitherto been considered as unprecedented : — A statement of every person's income, according as he is rated to the income tax. Possessors of sugarestates pay 6s. on every ton of sugar ; and others, when their incomes, independent of such estates, amount to 200/. currency, are to pay 1/. per cent.

Chucuito, The lake of ; which, although it be thus called, is also known by the name of Titicaca, is 51 leagues in length from n. w. to s. e. and 26 in width, although in some parts less. On its shores are six provinces or corregimientos, which are, The province of this Paucarcolla,  name,  
Lampa, Asangaro.

This lake is of sufficient depth for vessels of any size, since in many bays not far in from its shores there are from four to six fathoms of water, and within it, some places from 40 &lt;o 50. It is, as far as is ascertained, without any shoals or banks. Near it grow some herbs, called clacchos, eaten by the cows and pigs ; also a great quantity of the herb called totora, or cat's tail, which in some parts grows to the length of a yard and an half. Of this the Indians make rafts, not only for fishing but for carrying toand frothe cattleand productions of the harvest and crops growing in the various islands lying in this lake. Some of these islands are so covered and hemmed in with the herb totora that it requires much force and labour to cut a passage through it. In one of the largest of these islands the Incas had a magnificent temple, dedicated to the sun, the first that was ever built. This lake is not without its tempests and squalls ; they are, on the contrary, frequent, and have at times caused no inconsiderable mischief. Its waters are thick, but are nevertheless drank by the cattle, and even the Indians ; particularly by those of the nation of the Uros, who are a poor ignorant people, who formerly lived upon the islands in great wretchedness, and who by dint of great solicitations have been prevailed upon to leave them for the mainland, where they now reside in some miserable caves, excavated places, or holes in ihe earth covered over with fags of totora, maintainVOJi.

They also catch some small pejereyes, and an infinite variety of birds, which are  salted, and afford excellent food. It is confidently and repeatedly asserted by the Indians, that the greater part of the riches of the country was thrown into this lake when the Spaniards entered it at the time of the conquest ; and amongst other valuables the great gold chain made by the order of the Inca Huayanacap, which was 233 yards in length, and within which 6000 men could dance.

They were, hoAvever, once attacked by the brigadier, the Marquis de Mena Hermosa, general of Callao, who constructed some forts, which are still served with artillery and troops sufficient to protect them. These Indians have a chief or prince, called the chiincho, descended, according to their accounts, from the royal race of the lncas, who would fain Jay claim to the monarchy of Peru as his right; and accordingly, in 1744, represented to the Marquis of Villa Garcia, not without great threats, his intention of doing himself justice by force of arms : he is a Catholic, and has added to his own honours the title of King of Peru ; he was brought up at Lima amongst the Spaniards as the son of a cazique f where he was instructed in the rules of government, policy, and military tactics, which he introduced into his own country, and made known the use of swords and firearms.

CHUQUI ==[[Yapu|YAPU]]==, an ancient province of Peru, ■which was conquered and united to the empire by Mayta Capac, fourth Emperor of the Incas, after the famous battle and victory of Huallu against the Collas Indians. It is tolerably well peopled, iand of a cold climate. Its territory abounds in excellent pastures, in which there are great quantities of cattle. In some parts, where the temperature is hot, there is found maize, cacao, and sugarcane. This country abounds in woods, and in these are found tigers, leopards, stags, and monkeys of many different species.

==[[Churchill|CHURCHILL]]==, a great river of New S. Wales, one of the provinces of N. America, at the mouth of which the English Hudson bay company have a fort and establishment ; situate in lat. 59° n. and long. 94° 12' w. The commerce of this place is great and lucrative, and on account of its great distance entirely secure from any disturbance from the French. In 1747 the number of castorskins, which Were brought by 100 Indians to this spot in their canoes, amounted to 20,000. Several other kinds of skins were also brought from the n. by 200 other Indians ; some of whom came hither by the river Seals, or Marine Wolves, 15 leagues to the s. of the fort. To the n. of this fort there are no castors, since there are no woods where these animals are found, though there are many other woods which abound in wolves, bears, foxes, buffaloes, and other animals whose skins are valuable. Here are great quantities of shrubs or small trees, planted by the factory, supplying timber ; but the opposite side of the river is most favourable to their growth : and at a still greater distance are found large trees of various kinds. The company residing in the fort is exposed to many risks, and obliged to inhabit a rock surrounded by frosts and snows for eight months in the year, being exposed -to all the winds and tempests. On account of the deficiency of pasture, they maintain near the fac-  
CHY  tory no more than four or five horses, and a bull with two cows ; for the maintenance of which during the winter, fodder is brought from a fenny bottom some miles distant from the river. Those who have been here affirm, that between this river and the river Nelson there is, at a great distance up the country, a communication or narrow pass of land, by which these rivers are divided; and the Indians who carry on this traffic, have dealings with the English navigating the river Nelson or Albany.

==[[Cicasica|CICASICA]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru ; bounded n. and n. e. by the mountains of the Andes, and the province of Larecaxa ; e. by the province of Cochabamba ; s. e. by that of Paria and corregimiento of Oruro ; on the s. it is touched by the river of Desaguadero ; s. w. by the province of Pacfiges ; and n. zs. and w. by the city of La Paz. It is one of the greatest in the whole kingdom, since the corregidor is obliged to place here 12   lieutenants for the administration of justice, on account of its extent. It is five leagues from n. to *. and 80 from e. to w. Its temperature is various ; in some parts there are some very cold serranias, in which breed every species of cattle, in proportion to the number of estates found there. That part which borders upon the Andes is very hot and moist, but at the same time fertile, and abounding in all kinds of fruits and plantations of sugarcane, and in cacao estates, the crops of which are very great, and produce a lucrative commerce ; the use of this leaf, which was before only common to the Indians, being now general amongst the Spaniards of both sexes and all classes ; so that one basketful, which formerly cost no more than five dollars, will now fetch from 10 to 11 : vines are also cultivated, and from these is made excellent wine. This province is watered by the river La Paz, which is the source of the Beni ; also by a river descending from the branches of the Cordillera, and which, in the wet season, is tolerably large. At the river Corico begins the navigation by means of rafts to the settlement of Los Reyes. Amongst the productions of this province may be counted Jesuits bark, equal to that of Loxa, according to the experiments made at Lima. This province begins at the river Majaviri, which divides the suburbs of Santa Barbara from the city of La Paz, and here is a little valley watered by the above river, and in it are a few houses or countryseats belonging to the inhabitants of the above city. This valley, which is of a delightful temperature, extends as far as the gold mine called Chuquiahuilla, on the skirt of the cordillera, where was found that rich lump of gold which weighed 90 marks, the largest ever seen in that kingdom, with the peculiarity, that upon assaying it, it was found to have six different alloys ; its degrees of perfection differing from 18 to 23 \; and that being valued in Spanish money, it proved to be worth 11,269 dollars 3| reals. This prize was carried to the royal treasury, and upon this occasion the Marquis of Castelfuerte, theu viceroy, received the thanks of his majesty. In the territory of Cinco Curatos (or Five Curacies) of the Andes are found in the forests excellent woods, such as cedars, corcobolos, &amp;c. and many fine fruits, also tobacco. It had formerly very rich mines of gold and silver, which are still known to exist in other mountains besides that of Santiago, but the natives have no inclination to work them. The aforementioned mountain has the peculiarity of abounding in either sort of the said metals. In the asiento of the mines of Arica, there is a gold mine which -produces but little. From the wools of the flocks are made some   manufactures peculiar to the country, such as coarse trowsers, baizes, and blankets. Although it is some years since this province has received any mischief from the infidels who inhabit the mountains of the Andes, yet it has regular advanced detachments or guards stationed for the defence of the frontiers, prepared against a recurrence of the evils experienced in former times. As we have before said, it is the largest province, so also it is the best peopled, since it contains upwards of 50,000 souls and 33 settlements, the capital of which has the same name. Its repartimiento, or tribute, used to amount to 226,750 dollars, and it used to pay an alcavala of 1814 dollars per annum. The settlements are, Cicasica, Mecapaca,

It is 80 leaoues long from e. to w. and 60 wide from n. to s. ° Its territory is for the most part mountainous and uneven, and its temperature bad. Its productions are large cattle, wax, maize, and fruits. The capital is the settlement of the same name, of a hot temperature, and inhabited by 25 families of Indians, who cultivate maize and melons, upon which this scanty population consists, though it was formerly of some consideration. It has suffered, no doubt, from the unkindness of the temperature, and from the want of water. The jurisdiction is 80 leagues to the w. with a slight inclination to the s. of Mexico. The other settlements are, Guacana, Paraquaro, 
Ario, Nocupetajo,

==[[Cinaloa|CINALOA]]==, a province and government of Nueva Espana. It is between the w. and n. of Mexico, from whence it is distant 300 leagues. It extends in length as far. as proselytes have been made to the gospel, viz. to 140° ; and it extends to 40° in width. On the e. of it are the loftiest sierras of Topia, running towards the n. and on the w. it is embraced by the arm of the sea of California. On the s. it has the town of Culiacan, and to the n. the innumerable nations of Indians, the boundaries of which are unknown. This province lies between lat. 27° and 32° n.; this being the extent to whicli the missonaries have penetrated. The temperature is extremely hot, although the cold is intense during the months of December and January. It rains here very little, especially upon the coast ; and seldom more than 3 p  C I N  four or five times in the year ; which causes the ground to be so parched, that it -would be entirely uninhabitable, were it not for the multitude of streams with which it is intersected, and which render the temperature mild and healthy. The country for the most part consists of levels, covered with green shrubs and trees, forming shady woods of three or four leagues in extent. In these are found the Brazilwood, ebony, &amp;c. which serve as an asylum for wild beasts, leopards and wild boars, deer and rabbits, a variety of mountain cats, coyotes, serpents and vipers. In the valleys are found a multitude of quails, turtledoves, pheasants, cranes, parrots, macaws, much esteemed for the beauty of their plumage, and with which the Indians adorn themselves, and an infinite variety of other birds. The rivers, all of which descend from the sierras of Topia, in the rainy season increase to such a degree as to inundate the country for the space of three or four leagues ; and generally remaining out for eight days at least, the Indians are under the necessity of forming for themselves a kind of terrace upon the branches of trees, "by means of planks and sods, where they make fires and dress their food. There are many salt ponds, also mines of silver, which are not worked for want of labourers. This province was peopled by several nations of Indians, who had their villages and huts on the sides of rivers. They used to maintain themselves on maize, which they cultivated, also on calabashes, which are very sweet and savoury, French beans, and a species of wild carob plant, called by them mesqmteSy and which being ground, they used to drink in water, after the manner of chocolate. They had also another delicacy in the plant called mescal) which resembles the savila ; of this there are several sorts, of which they make wine, sweets, and vinegar ; of its tendrils thread, and of its prickles needles. This country also abounds in nopales, pitahat/as, and other plants, including many which are native to Europe. Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca was the first who discovered this extensive province in his perigrination, afterhe had suffered shipwreck in going from Florida to Mexico ; and from his report of it, the viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza was induced to send into it some persons to discover more concerning it. In 1590 it was visited by the regulars of the company of Jesuits, who came hither to preach the gospel. They succeeded in making proselytes amongst the natives, and established a regular mission, which was patronized by the Queen Dona Margarita of Austria, wife of Philip III.; she having sent, for the promotion of the interests of   this great object, and for the decorations of the altars, &amp;c. several valuable presents of jewels, ornaments, and other precious articles.

Formerly the best cocoa wine of any in the kingdom was made here, from the abundance of this fruit found in all the palm estates ; but the art of bringing it to perfection was lost, and this branch of commerce died away, from the additional cause, that the making of this liquor was prohibited by the viceroy, the Duke of Albuquerque, as being a drink calculated to produce great inebriety.

It is 52 leagues in length s. e. n. w. and 16 in width. Its temperature is cold, from being situate in the cordillera ; with the exception of that part which borders upon Camana, where it is very mild, especially in the five leagues where its COL jurisdiction extends itself in the valley of Sihuas ; the other five leagues reaching to the sea bordering on Camana. Its productions are various : those of the valley are comprised in wine, brandies, wheat, maize, pulse, and fruits, especially figs, which being preserved, serve as nourishment to numbers of poor people. The other territories of this province are of the same temperature, though comparatively barren. It abounds in large and small cattle, native sheep, vicunas, and some wild animals. The roads are dangerous, from the country's being extremely unequal, and the greater part of it being a craggy ravine, over which labours, rather than to say runs, a pretty large river, which has its rise within the province. Here are many silver mines, from which great riches were formerly extracted, since they yielded 80 or 100 marks each caxon. Atthe present day they yield but sparingly, on account of their great depth, some of them being 200 fathoms in descent ; they are, nevertheless, worked with tolerable profit. The principal mountain of these mines is that of Caylloma, and it was through this mine that the capital was founded. There are also not wanting mines of gold, tin, lead, copper, and sulphur; but these, on account of the deficiency of resources, remain unworked. The capital, as we have before stated, is Caylloma.

==[[Collana|COLLANA]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Cicasica in Peru ; annexed to the curacy of Mecapa. Its Indian inhabitants have kept themselves unmixed from any other cast ever since the time of the conquest ; and in order to still preserve themselves so, they will not allow of any strangers sleeping in the settlement, though he should be sent by the corregidor. If any other person should come among them, he is put into prison, and after a very short time dispatched. Owing to these precautions, the vicious propenpensities observable in other settlements are en-   COL tirely unknown to this. Its inhabitants lead a regular life ; they give without expectation of indemnification, and are governed throughout the whole tribe by the sounding of a bell. In short, they might serve as a model for all the other settlements of Indians in the kingdom.

The principal rivers of this country are, the Idisiows, the S. and N. Two or three miles up the former river, the shores are covered with plantations, which continue for more than three miles further n. where the river meets with the N. Edistow, and in the island formed by both of them, it is reckoned that 20 freeholders reside. These are thus called, from the nature of the assignment and distribution of lands which took place in the new colonies. But the English governor did not grant an absolute and perpetual property, save to particular individuals : the concession was sometimes for life, sometimes considered as lineal, sometimes to descend to the wife, children, or relations, and sometimes with greater restrictions.

This city has suffered extreme misfortunes ever since the time of its foundation ; for shortly after this took place, its inhabitants found themselves under the necessity of retiring from it to Santiago, through the invasion of the Araucanos and Tucapeles Indians, who made themselves masters of it, and sacked and burnt it in 1554, under the command of the Cazique Lautaro : again, though the Spaniards endeavoured to repeople it, they were a second time driven back, as also a third time, in 1603, when the Governor Don Garcia Hurtardo de Mendoza, Marquis of Canete, had come to suppress the general insurrection of the Indians. It was after this rebuilt, and in 1730 again destroyed by a dreadful earthquake, being entirely inundated by the sea. It suffered also much from a similar shock in 1751. In the chief square, or marketplace, is a beautiful fountain, made by the command of Don Diego Gonzalo Montero. The tribunal of royal audience was fixed in this city from the time that it was founded, in 1567, and remained here until the year 1574, when it was translated to the capital of the kingdom, Santiago. It has been the head of a bishopric ever since 1620, when this honour was transferred to the city of Imperial. It is the residence of a governor, dependent on the captaingeneral and president ; it being bis duty to reside six months of the year in Santiago, and the other six in this city. [Besides the commerce of hides, tallow, and dried beef, the inhabitants of Concepcion carry on a trade in wheat, which Frazier asserts yields 100 for one.

It has some gold mines which were worked in former times, and which, on account of the baseness of the metal, the depth of the mines, and hardness of the strata, have not produced so much as formerly they did, although they are not now without yielding some emolument : such are those of Airahua, Quiquimbo, Araure, and Aznacolea, which may produce a little more than the expences incurred in working them. The gold of these mines is from 19 to 20 carats, and they produce from three to four ounces each caxon. They are worked by means of steel and powder, and the metals are ground in mills. The greater part of the natives of this province oc v cupy themselves in carrying the productions of the valley of Mages, of the province of Cainana, such as wines and brandies, to the other provinces of the sierra; also in the cultivation of seeds, and some in working the mines.

It is indeed attributed to the air, which is at that time highly charged with electric fluid; the effects of which may be observed on the handles of sticks;, buckles, lace, and other .metal trinkets ; the same effects ceasing as soon as the tempest is over.

==[[Connecticut|CONNECTICUT]]==, a county of the province and colony of New England in N. America. It is bounded w. by New York and the river Hudson ; is separated from the large island by an arm of the sea to the s, ; has to the e. Rhode island, with part of the colony of Massachusetts, and the other part of the same colony to the n. It is traversed by a river of the same name, which is the largest of the whole province, and navigable by large vessels for 40 miles. This province abounds in wood, turpentine, and resins ; in the collecting of which numbers of the inhabitants are occupied, although the greater part of them are employed in fishing, and in hewing timber for the building of vessels and other useful purposes. The merchants of the province once sent to King Charles II. some timber or trees, of so fine a growth as to serve for masts of ships of the largest burthen. The great trade of woods and timbers carried on by means of the river has much increased its navigation. This territory is not without its mines of metal, such as lead, iron, and copper: the first of these have yielded some emolument, but the others have never yet produced any thing considerable, notwithstanding the repeated attempts which have been made to work them. This county is well peopled and flourishing, since it numbers upwards of 40,000 souls, notwithstanding the devastations that it has suffered through the French, the Indians, and the pirates, in the reign of Queen Anne, when all the fishing vessels were destroyed. When this colony was first founded, many great privileges were given it, which have always been maintained by the English governor, through the fidelity which it manifested in not joining the insurrection of the province of Massachusetts, until, in the last war, it was separated from the metropolis, as is seen in the article United Statls of America. [Connecticut, one of the United Stales of North America, called by the ancient natives Qunnihticut, is situated between lat. 41°. and 42* 2' n. and between long. 71° 20' and 73° 1 5' w. Its greatest breadth is 72 miles, its length 100 miles ; bounded /?. by Massachusetts ; e. by Rhode island ; s. by the sound which divides it from Long island ; and w. by the state of New York. This state contains about 4674 square miles ; equal to about 2,640,000 acres. It is divided into eight counties, viz. Fairfield, New Haven, Middlesex, and New London, which extend along the sound from w. to e. : Litchfield, Hartford, Tolland, and Windham, extend in the same direction on the border of the] St 2    CONNECTICUT.  
[state of Massachusetts. The counties are divided and subdivided into townships and parishes; in each of which is one or more places of public worship, and schoolhouses at convenient distances. The number of townships is about 200. Each township is a corporation invested with powers sufficient for their own internal regulation. The number of representatives is sometimes 180; but more commonly about 160 ; a number fully adequate to legislate for a wise and virtuous people, well informed, and jealous of their rights ; and whose external circumstances approach nearer to equality than those, perhaps, of any other people in a state of civilization in the world. 
The principal rivers in this state are, Connecticut, Housatonick, the Thames, and their branches, which, with such others as are worthy of notice, are described under their respective names. The whole of the seacoast is indented with harbours, many of which are safe and commodious; those of New London and New Haven are the most important. This state sends seven representatives to congress. Connecticut, though subject to the extremes of heat and cold, in their seasons, and to frequent sudden changes, is very healthful. It is generally broken land, made up of mountains, hills, and valleys ; and is exceedingly wellwatered. Some small parts of it are thin and barren. Its principal productions are Indian corn, rye, wheat in many parts of the state, oats, and barley, which are heavy and good, and of late buckwheat, flax in large quantities, some hemp, potatoes of several kinds, pumpkins, turnips, peas, beans, &amp;c. &amp;c. ; fruits of all kinds Avhich are common to the climate. The soil is very well calculated for pasturage and mowing, which enables the farmers to feed large numbers of neat cattle and horses. 
The trade of Connecticut is principally with the W. India islands, and is carried on in vessels from 60 to 140 tons. The exports consist of horses, mules, oxen, oakstaves, hoops, pineboards, oakplank, beams, Indian corn, fish, beef, pork, ISfcc. Horses, live cattle, and lumber, are permitted in the Dutch, Danish, and French ports. A large number of coasting vessels are employed in carrying the produce of the state to other states. To Rhode island, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, 'they carry pork, wheat, corn, and rye ; to N. and S. Carolina, and Georgia, butter, cheese, salted beef, cider, apples, potatoes, hay, &amp;c. and receive in return, rice, indigo, and money. But as New York is nearer, and the state of the markets always well known, much of the produce of Connecticut, especially of the w. parts, is carried there; particularly pot and pearlashes, flaxseed, beef, pork, cheese and butter, in large quantities. Most of the produce of Connecticut river from the parts of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont, as well as of Connecticut, which are adjacent, goes to the same market. Considerable quantities of the produce of the e. parts of the state are marketed at Boston, Providence, and Norwich. The value of the whole exported produce and commodities from this state, before the year 1774, was then estimated at about 200,000/. lawful money annually. In the year ending Sept. SO, 1791, the amount of foreign exports was 710,340 dollars, besides articles carried to different parts of the United States, to a great amount. In the year 1792, 749.925 dollars; in the year 1793, 770,239 dollars; and in the year 1794, 806,746 dollars. This state owns and employs in the foreign and coasting trade 32,897 tons of shipping. 
The farmers in Connecticut, and their families, are mostly clothed in plain, decent, homespun cloth. Their linens and woollens are manufactured in the family way ; and although they are generally of a coarser kind, they are of a stronger texture, and much more durable than those imported from France and Great Britain. Many of their cloths are fine and handsome. Here are large orchards of mulberrytrees ; and silkworms have been reared so successfully, as to promise not only a supply of silk to the inhabitants, but a surplussage for exportation. In New Haven are linen and button manufactories. In Hartford a woollen manufactory has been established; likewise glass works, a snuff and powder mill, iron works, and a slitting mill. Ironworks are established also at Salisbury, Norwich, and other parts of the state. At Stafford is a furnace at which are made large quantities of hollow ware, and other ironmongery, sufficient to supply the whole state. Paper is manufactured at Norwich, Hartford, New Haven, and in Litchfield county. Ironmongery, hats, candles, leather, shoes, and boots, are manufactured in this state. A duck manufactory has been established at Stratford. The state of Connecticut is laid out in small farms, from 50 to 300 and 400 acres each, which are held by the farmers in fee simple ; and are generally well cultivated. The state is chequered with innumerable roads or highways crossing each other in every direction. A traveller in any of these roads, even in the most unsettled parts of the state, will seldom pass more than two or three miles without finding a house or cottage, and a farm under such improvements as to afford the necessaries for the support of a family. The whole state resembles a well cultivated garden,}  

CONNECTICUT.  [which, with that degree of industry that is necessary to happiness, produces the necessaries and conveniences of life in great plenty. The inhabitants are almost entirely of English descent. There are no Dutch, French, or Germans, and very few Scotch or Irish people, in any part of the state. The original stock from which have sprung all the present, inhabitants of Connecticut, and the numerous emigrants from the state to every part of the United States, consisted of 3000 souls, who settled in the towns of Hartford, New Haven, Windsor, Guilford, Milford, and Weathersfield, about the years 1635 and 1636. In 1756, the population of the state amounted to 130,611 souls ; in 1774, to J 97,856; in 1782, to 202,877 whites, and 6273 Indians and Negroes ; in 1790, to 237,946 persons, of whom 2764 were slaves; and by the cenfield, Norwich, Windham,  
Enfield, are all considerable and very pleasant towns. In no part of the world is the education of all ranks of people more attended to than in Connecticut. Almost every town in the state is divided into districts, and each district has a public school kept in it a greater or less part of every year. Somewhat more than onethird of the moneys arising from a tax on the polls and rateable estate of the inhabitants is appropriated to the support of schools in the several towns, for the education of children and youth. The law directs that a grammarschool shall be kept in every county  town throughout the state.  
Yale college i  sus of 1810, to 261,942 souls. The people of Connecticut are remarkably fond of having all their disputes, even those of the most trivial kind, settled according to law. The prevalence of this litigious spirit affords employment and support for a numerous body of lawyers. That party spirit, however, which is the bane of political happiness, has not raged with such violence in this state as in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Public proceedings have been conducted generally with much calmness and candour. The people are well ininformed in regard to their rights, and judicious in the methods they adopt to secure them. The state enjoys an uncommon share of political tranquillity and unanimity. 
All religions, that are consistent with the peace of society, are tolerated in Connecticut : and a spirit of liberality and forbearance is increasing. There are very few religious sects in this state. The bulk of the people are Congregationalists. Besides these, there are Episcopalians and Baptists. 
The damage sustained by this state in the late war was estimated at 461,235/. 16s. Id. To compensate the sufferers, the general court, in May 1792, granted them 500,000 acres of the w. part of the reserved lands of Connecticut, which lie w. of Pennsylvania. There are a great number of very pleasant towns, both maritime and inland, in Connecticut. It contains five cities, incorporated with extensive jurisdiction in civil causes. Two of these, Hartford and New Haven, are capitals of the state. The general assembly is h olden at the former in May, and at the latter in October, annually. The other cities are New London, Norwich, and Middlcton. Weathersfield, Windsor, Farmington, Litchfield, Milford, Stratford, Fairfield, Guilford, Stamford, Windham, Suffield, and  eminent seminary of learning, and was founded in the year 1700. See Yale College. Academies have been established at Greenfield, Plainand Pomfret, some of  which are flourishing. 
The constitution of Connecticut is founded on their charter, which was granted by Charles II. in 1662, and on a law of the state. Contented with this form of government, the people have not been disposed to run the hazard of framing a new constitution since the declaration of independence. Agreeable to this charter, the supreme legislative authority of the state is vested in a governor, deputygovernor, twelve assistants, or counsellors, and the representatives of the people, styled the general assembly. The governor, deputygovernor, and assistants, are annually chosen by the freemen in the month of May. The representatives (their number not to exceed two from each town) are chosen by the freemen twice ayear, to attend the two annual sessions, on the second Tuesdays of May and October. The general assembly is divided into two branches, called the upper and lower houses. The upper house is composed of the governor, deputy -governor, and assistants ; the lower bouse of the representatives of the people. No law can pass without the concurrence of both houses. 
Connecticut has ever made rapid advances in population. There have been more emigrations from this than from any of the other states, and yet it is at present full of inhabitants. This increase may be ascribed to several causes. The bulk of the inhabitants are industrious, sagacious husbandmen. Their farms furnish them with all the necessaries, most of the conveniences, and but few of the luxuries of life. They, of course, must be generally temperate, and if they choose, oan subsist with as much independence as is consistent with happiness. The subsistence of the farmer is substantial, and does not depend on incidental circumstances, like that of most other professions.]     
" ';■ '  CONNECTICUT.   [There is no necessity of serving an apprenticeship to the business, nor of a large stock of money to commence it to advantage. Farmers who deal much in barter, have less need of money than any other class of people. The ease with which a comfortable subsistence is obtained, induces the husbandman to marry young. The cultivation of his farm makes him strong and healthful. He toils cheerfully through the day, eats the fruit of his own labour with a gladsome heart, at nightdevoutly thanks his bounteous God for his daily blessings, retires to rest, and his sleep is sweet. Such circumstances as these have greatly contributed to the amazing increase of inhabitants in this state. Besides, the people live under a free government, and have no fear of a tyrant. There are no overgrown estates, with rich and ambitious landlords, to have an undue and pernicious influence in the election of civil officers. Property is equally enough divided; and must continue to be so, as long as estates descend as they now do. No person is prohibited from voting. He who has the most merit, not he who has the most money, is generally chosen inio public office. As instances of this, it is to be observed, that many of the citizens of Connecticut, from the humble walks of life, have arisen to the first offices in the state, and filled them with dignity and reputation. That base business of electioneering, which is so directly calculated to introduce wicked and designing men, into office, is yet but little known in Connecticut. A man who wishes to be chosen into office, acts wisely, for that end, when he keeps his desires to himself. 
A thirst for learning prevails among all ranks of people in the state. More of the young men in Connecticut, in proportion to their numbers, receive a public education, than in any of the states. The revolution, which so essentially affected the government of most of the colonies, produced no very perceptible alteration in the government of Connecticut. While under the jurisdiction of Great Britain,, they elected their own governors, and all .subordinate civil officers, and made their own laws, in the same manner and with as little controul as they now do. Connecticut has ever been .a republic, and perhaps as perfect and as happy a republic as has ever existed. While otherstates, more monarchical in their govemmen and manners, have been under a necessity of undertaking the difficult task of altering their old, or forming new constitutions, and of changing their monarchical for republican manners, Connecticut has uninterruptedly proceeded in her old track, both as to government and manners ; and, by these  means, has avoided those convulsions which have rent other states into violent parties. 
The present territory of Connecticut, at the time of the first arrival of the English, was possessed by the Pequot, the Mohegan, Podunk, and many other smaller tribes of India«s. In 1774, there were of the descendants of the ancient natives only 1363 persons ; the greater part of whom lived at Mohegan, between Norwich and New London. From the natural decrease of the Indians, it is imagined that their number in thissta4e do not now exceed 400. The first grant of Connecticut was made by the Plymouth council to the Earl of Warwick, in 1630. The year following the earl assigned this grant to Lord Say and Seal, Lord Brook, and nine others. Some Indian traders settled at Windsor in 1633. The same year, a little before the arrival of the English, a few Dutch traders settled at Hartford, and the remains of the settlement are still visible on the bank of Connecticut river. In 1634, Lord Say and Seal, &amp;c. sent over a small number of mei*$ who built a fort at Saybrook, and made a treaty with the Pequot Indians for the lands on Connecticut river. Mr. Haynes and Mr. Hooker left Massachusetts bay in 1634, and settled at Hartford. The following year, Mr. Eaton and Mr. Davenport seated themselves at New Haven. In 1644, the Connecticut adventurers purchased of Mr. Fenwick, agent for Lord Say and Seal, and Lord Brook, their right to the colony, for 1600/. Connecticut and New Haven continued two distinct governments for many years. At length, John Winlhrop, Esq. who had been chosen governor of Connecticut, was employed to solicit a royal charter. In 1662, Charles II. granted a charter, constituting the two colonies for ever one body corporate und politic, by the name of " The Governor and Company of Connecticut." New Haven took the affair ill ; but in 1665, all difficulties were amicably adjusted ; and, as has been already observed, this charter still continues to be the basis of their government. The capital is Boston.] 
[Connecticut is the most considerable river in the e. part of the United States, and rises in the high lands which separate the states of Vermont and New Hampshire from Lower Canada. It has been surveyed about 25 miles beyond the 45° of latitude, to the head spring of its n. branch ; from which, to its mouth, is upwards of 300 miles, through a thick settled country, having upon its banks a great number of the most flourishing and pleasant towns in the United States. It is from 80 to 100 rods wide, 130 miles from its mouth. Its course between Vermont and New Hampshire]  

CONNECTICUT.  
5fl  
[is generally s. s. tfr. as likewise through Massachusetts, and part of Connecticut, until it reaches the city of Middleton : after which it runs a s. s. e. course to its mouth. The navigation of this beautiful river, which, like the Nile, fertilizes the lands through which it runs, is much obstructed by falls ; two of these are between New Hampshire and Vermont, the first are called the Fifteenmile falls ; here the river is rapid for 20 miles : the second remarkable fall is at Walpole, formerly called the Great falls, but now called Bellows' falls. Above these the breadth of the river is in some places 22, in other places not above 16 rods ; the depth of the channel is about 25 feet, and commonly runs full of water. In September 1792, however, owing to the severe drought, the water of the river, it is said, "passed within the space of 12 feet wide, and 2\ feet deep." A large rock divides the stream into two channels, each about 90 feet wide ; when the river is low, the e. channel is dry, being crossed by a solid rock ; and the ■whole stream falls into the w. channel, where it is contracted to the breadth of 16 feet, and flows with astonishing rapidity. There are several pitches, one above another, in the length of half a mile, the largest of which is that where the rock divides the stream. A bridge of timber was projected over this fall by Colonel Hale, in the year 1784, 365 feet long, and supported in the middle by the island rock, and under it the highest floods pass without doing any injury ; this is the only bridge on the river, but it is contemplated to erect another, SO miles above, at the middle bar of Agar falls, where the passage for the water, between the rocks, is 100 feet wide ; this will connect the towns of Lebanon in New Hampshire, and Hartford in Vermont ; as the former bridge connects Walpole in New Hampshire with Rockingham in Vermont. Notwithstanding the velocity of the current at Bellows' falls, above described, the salmon pass np the river, and are taken many miles above, but the shad proceed no farther. On the steep sides of the island rock, at the fall, hang several arm chairs, secured by a counterpoise ; in these the fishermen sit to catch salmon with fishing nets. In the course of the river, through Massachusetts, are the falls at South Hadley, around which locks and canals were completed in 1795, by an enterprising company, incorporated for that purpose in 1792, by the legislature of Massachusetts. In Connecticut the river is obstructed by falls at Enfield, to render which navigable in boats, a company has been incorporated, and a sum of money raised by lottery, but nothing effectual is yet done. The  average descent of this river from Weathersfield in Vermont, 150 miles from its mouth, is two feet to a mile, according to the barometrical observations of J. Winthrop, Esq. made in 1786. The rivers or streams which fall into Connecticut river are numerous; such of them as are worthy of notice will be seen under their respective names. At its mouth is a bar of sand, which considerably obstructs the navigation; it has 10 feet water on it at full tides, and the depth is the same to Middleton, from which the bar is 36 miles distant. Above Middleton there are some shoals which have only six feet water at high tide, and here the tide ebbs and flows about eight inches ; three miles above that city the river is contracted to about 40 rods in breadth, by two high mountains ; on almost every other part of the river the banks are low, and spread into fine extensive meadows. In the spring floods, which generally happen in May, these meadows are covered with water. At Hartford, the water sometimes rises 20 feet above the common surface of the river, and the water having no other outlet but the above mentioned strait,, it is sometimes two or three weeks before it returns to its usual bed ; these floods add nothing to the depth of Avater on the bar at the mouth of the river, as the bar lies too far off in the sound to be affected by them. This river is navigable to Hartford city upwards of 50 miles from its mouth, and the produce of the country for 200 miles above it, is brought thither in boats. The boats which are used in this business are flatbottomed, long, and narrow, and of so light a make as to be portable in carts : before the construction of locks and canals on this river, they were taken out at three different carrying places, all of which made 15 miles : it is expected that in a few years the ob-  structions will be all removed.  
Sturgeoi.,  salmon,  and shad, are caught in plenty in their season, from the mouth of the river upwards, excepting sturgeon, which do not ascend the upper falls; besides a variety of small fish, such as pike, carp, perch, &amp;c. There is yet a strong expectation of opening a communication between this river and the Merrimack, through Sugar river, which runs into the Connecticut at Claremont in New Hampshire, and the Contoocook, which falls into the Merrimack at Boscawert. From this river were employed, in 1789, three brigs of 180 tons each, in the European trade ; and about 60 sail, from 60 to 150 tons, in the VV. India trade, besides a few fishermen, and 40 or 50 coasting vessels. The number has considerably increased since.] [Connecticut, a stream in Long island, New  i    512  York, which falls into a bay at the s. side of the island.

COP1APO, a province and corregimiento of the kingdom of Chile ; bounded n. by the province of Atacama, of the archbishopric of Charcas, and kingdom of Peru ; e. by the territory of the city of Rioja, of the province of Tucuman, the cordillera running between ; s. by the province of Coquimbo, and w. by the Pacific ocean. Its extent is 60 leagues n. s. and from 20 to three e. w. It very seldom rains here ; cattle is therefore scarce, although it nevertheless produces every sort of grain, of excellent quality, and fruits of various kinds. The temperature is very benign throughout the year.  

COP  It has many mines of copper, most pure and rich sulphur, loadstone, lapis lazuli, and gold ; some of which are worked ; and it is not many years ago that some silver mines also were discovered. It produces a kind of small trees, which are planted and cultivated upon the banks of the streams and aqueducts, called paxaro hobo, and which distil a liquor, which, being prepared over the fire, serves instead of pitch for lining the vessels in which the wine in that kingdom is kept. The conger eel abounds upon the coast, and there is a particular tribe of Indians, called Changos, who are devoted to this kind of fishery, living the whole year upon the coasts, and carrying about their wives and children upon rafts, until they find out a creek likely to afford them what they are in search of: these fish are then bought by the natives, and carried to be sold at the capital of the kingdom, Santiago. Here is also a trade of sulphur, since it is so fine that it needs never to be purified, and is consequently worth three dollars the cantaro [a cantaro is about four gallons]. It abounds no less in nitre, on which account all the waters here are brackish, and there is little indeed that is sweet. This province is very thinly peopled, since it has no other population than such as is found in the capital, which is called San Francisco de la Selva. Its inhabitants, which should amount to 5000, of all sexes and ages, are dispersed about in country farms. [The province of Copiapo owes its name, according to the Indian tradition, to the great quantity of turquoises found in its mountains. Though these stones ought, with propriety, to be classed amongst the concretions, as they are only the petrified teeth or bones of animals, coloured by metallic vapours, we may place them amongst the precious stones. The turquoises of Copiapo are usually of a greenish blue ; some, however, are found of a deep blue, which are very hard, and known by the name of the turquoises of the old rock. The amazing fertility of the soil of this province has given rise to assertions, which, on the first blush, might appear fabulous. Mr. Sanson, of Abbeville, in his Geography, asserts that its valleys frequently yield 300 for one. See Chile.]

[COPPER Mine, a large river of New Britain, reckoned to be the mostw. in N. America. Taking a n. course, it falls into the sea in lat. 72° n. and about long. 119°®. from Greenwich. The accounts brought by the Indians of this river to the British ports in Hudson bay, and the specimens of copper produced by them, induced Mr. Hearne to set out from fort Prince of Wales, in December 1770, on a journey of discovery. He reached the river on the 14th July, at 40 miles distance from the sea, and found it all the way encumbered with shoals and falls, and emptying itself into it over a dry flat of the shore, the tide being then out, which seemed by the edges of the ice to rise about 12 or 14 feet. This rise, on account of the falls, will carry it but a very small way within the river's mouth ; so that the water in it has not the least brackish taste. Mr. Hearne had the most extensive view of the sea, which bore n. w. by w. and 8. e. when he was about eight miles up the river. The sea at the river's mouth was full of islands and shoals; but the ice was only thawed away about threefourths of a mile from the shore, on the 17th of July. The Esquimaux had a quantity of Avhalebone and sealskins at their tents on the shore.]

COQU1MBO, a province and corregimiento of the kingdom of Chile ; bounded e. by the province of Tucuman, of the kingdom of Pern, the cordillera running between ; s. by the province of Quillota; and w. by the Pacific ocean. It is 80 leagues in length n. s. and 40 in width e. w. Its temperature is very benign ; and on account of its not raining much in the sierra, through the low situation of this part of the province, the snow and frost is not so common here, nor does it stay upon the ground so long as it does upon the parts which lie s. of Santiago. For the same reason the rivers are few, and the largest of them are those of Los Santos or Limari, and that which passes through its capital. Many huanutos and vicunas breed here. The territory is for the most part broken and uneven, and produces, although not in abundance, the same fruits as in the whole kingdom, such as grain, wine, and oil of excellent quality. It has many gold mines, likewise some of silver, copper, lead, sulphur, white lime, and salt ; but the most abundant of all are those of copper ; large quantities of this metal having been sent to Spain for founding artillery, and indeed from the same source has been made all the artillery in this kingdom. This metal is found of two sorts, one which is called campanal, and is only fit for founding, and the other, which has a mixture of gold, and is called de labrar, or working metal, and which is known only in this province. Here also they make large quantities of rigging for ships* Its inhabitants may amount to 15,000. [In this province is found the quisco tree, with thorns of eight inches long ; the same being used by the natives for knitting needles. It is noted for producing the best oysters, and for a resin which is yielded from the herb chilca. See Chile.] The capital bears the same name, or that of La Serena. This was the second settlement of the kingdom, and founded by the order of Pedro de Valdivia, by Captain Juan Bohon, in 1543, in the valley of Cuquimpi, which gave it its name, and which, being corrupted, is now called Coquimbo, and* EI Segundo de la Serena, in memory of the country of Valdivia in Estremadura. It lies at a quarter of a league's distance from the sea, and is situate  COR  upon tlie loftiest part of that most beautiful MtinKra, from which the prospect is so enchanting ; shewing on one side the sea, on another the river which waters the precincts, and on another some shady poplar groves. It is of an extremely benign temperature, and enjoying throughout the year a perpetual spring, being neither incommoded by heat nor cold. It is extremely fertile, and abounds in whatever can conduce to the comfort and convenience of life. The city is tolerably large; all the streets are drawn at straight lines ; and the houses are disjoined from each other by large gardens, which are all well supplied with water brought by aqueducts from the river. The parish church is very beautiful, and not less so are those of the religious orders of St. Francis, St. Domingo, St. Augustin, La Merced, San Juan de Dios, and the college which formerly belonged to the regulars of the company of the Jesuits. It has a port, which is convenient and much frequented by vessels ; upon the shore of which are caught tunnies, abacoras, and various other kinds of fish ; also many delicate kinds of shellfish. At a small distance is a very abundant copper mine, from which much metal is extracted and carried to Europe ; and it is of this, as well as of its excellent breed of horses, its wine, oil, tallow, cowhides, and dried meats, that its commerce is composed ; sending, as it does yearly, four or five vessels loaded with these effects to Lima. Although it has mines of the purest gold, yet these are but little worked. The whole of the town is covered with beautiful myrtles, and of these there is a delightful grove. It was destroyed by the Araucanos Indians in 1547 ; and in 1579 it was attempted to be taken by Francis Drake, who was repulsed by the inhabitants. In 1680 it seemed to be rebuilt only that it might undergo a sacking the same year by the English pirate, Bartholomew Sharps. Its population consists of 500 families of Spaniards and people of colour, and some Indians. Fifteen leagues from the city of Concepcion, and 58 from the capital of the kingdom, Santiago. Lat. 30° s.

Here is a convent of the religious Descnlzos (barefooted order) of St. Francis, and one of St. Hippolyte dela Caridad, in which there is an hospital for the sick Spaniards, and for the black slaves, endowed by the masters and proprietors of certain mills, in which an infinite quantity of sugar is made. It abounds in this article, with those of tobacco, China oranges, ajonjoli, large cattle, and swine ; as also other fruits and articles of merchandize peculiar to Europe and the kingdom itself. [Humboldt asserts that the environs of Cordova and Orizabaproduce all the tobacco consumed in New Spain.] Its population consists of 260 families of Spaniards, 126 of Mustees, 70 of Mulattocs and Negroes, and 273 of Mexican Indians ; of many others also who are of various classes, and who work in the sugarmills. Fortyeight leagues to the e.n. e. of Mexico, in lat. 18° 50'; long. 96° 56'. Theother settlements of this jurisdiction are, Santa Ana de Zacan, San Diego,

Cordova, another city, the capital of the province and government of Tucuman in Peru ; founded by the governor of that province, Geronimo Cabrera, in 1573, and not by Juan Nunez de Prado, in 1549, according to the erroneous account of the Exjesuit Coleti. It was in the territory of the Comichingones Indians, and part which they called Kiskisacate, on the shore of the river Pucara ; but removed from thence to the s. part of the same river ; the parish being dedicated to Nuestra Senora de la Pena of France, and being under the obligation of celebrating its festival on the day of the conception, when it was also usual to display the spectacle of a bullfight. It is situate in a narrow bay, close to which is a lofty mountain. It is much exposed to inundations in the rainy  w ft i m- O— * '*&gt;  seasons, and is flooded by waters rushing down through a neighbouring channel, and in fact Avould be hereby rendered uninhabitable, but for the mounds which have been raised for its defence. One half of the city experiences in one day a variation of all the winds from n. to *. These winds, thus changing, are accompanied with great tempests of thunder and lightning. At one moment the heat which accompanies the n. wind is excessive, and at another the cold which accompanies the s. is intolerable. It is, indeed, to this cause that the number of sudden deaths which occur here are attributed. The city is small, and nearly of a square figure, but the buildings are superior to any in the province. It has three convents ; those of the religious order of St. Francis, St. Domingo, and La Merced, an hospilal of Bethlemites, with the dedicatory title of San Roque ; two monasteries of nuns, the one of Santa Teresa, the other of Santa Clara, and two colleges with the titles of universities. It is the head of a bishopric, erected in 1570, and is very rich, owing to the great commerce which it carries on in mules bought in the province of Buenos Ayres, and fattened in the pastures here, for the purpose of being sold for the supply of the other provinces, and in fact of the whole of Peru. It abounds in all kinds of productions, and is 70 leagues from Santiago del Estero, to the s. in 62° 39'; long. 31° 20's. lat. [For an account of the late revolutions of this place, see La Plata.]

It rises in the n. part of the famed lake Parime, which some have thought to exist merely in fable. It runs s. watering the Dutch colonies ; and five leagues to the w. of Berbice, and to the s. e. of the Orinoco, empties itself into the sea, in 5° 22' n. lat. : at its entrance it is one league wide. The English call it Devil's creek, which signifies Barranco del Diablo. In the interior of its course it has some sandbanks, which extend for three leagues, and render its navigation difficult, notwithstanding that at the low tide there are still some channels of water. In this river are likewise three small well cultivated islands, lying in a direction from n. to s. They are very fertile, and covered with trees, and the soundings of the river about them varies from five to six fathoms.

==[[Coro|CORO]]==, Santa Anade, a city of the province and government of Venezuela, thus named in the time of the Indians, after the district called Coriana. It was founded by Juan de Ampues in 1529. The Weltzers, under the orders of Nicholas Federman, were the first who peopled it, giving it the name of Cordoba, to distinguish it from the other city of the same name which had been founded by Gonzalo de Ocampo in the province of Cumana. This name it afterwards lost, and took that of Coro, which it preserves to this day, from a small settlement of Indians thus named. It is of a dry and hot temperature, but so healthy that physicians are said here to be of no use. The territory, although sandy and lack of water, produces every kind of vegetable production ; so that it may be said to abound in every thing that luxury or convenience may require. Here are large breeds of cowcattle and goats, and a considerable number of good mules. Its articles of merchandize, such as cheese, tanned hides, and cacao, meet with a ready sale in Cartagena, Caracas, and the island of St. Domingo. It has a reduced convent of the religious order of St. Francis, and an hermitage dedicated to St. Nicholas. The town is very rich. It was plundered by the English in 1567. Its church was a cathedral, and the head of the bishopric, from the time that it was erected in. 1532 until 1636, when this title was transferred to Santiago of Caracas. It js two leagues distant from the sea, where there is a port insecure, but much frequented by trading vessels. [From the time that the governor began to reside at Caracas, in 1576, there remained no conspicuous authority at Coro but the bishop and chapter, and they did all they could to follow the governor; and indeed, not being able to leave Coro by legal measures, they put their wishes into effect by flight, in 1636. At three leagues from the city are lands where they cultivate with success, if not with abundance, all the usual produce of the country. The inhabitants, who are much addicted to indolence, glory that they are descended from the first conquerors of the country ; and there is here, generally speaking, more rank than wealth, and more idleness than industry. The little trade that is carried on here consists in mules, goats, hides, sheepskins, cheeses, &amp;c. which come In a great measure from the interior, and the larger part from Carora ; shipments of these articles are made for the islands. The most common intercourse is with Curacoa, from whence they 8  i ■  [bring in exchange dry goods, and this they do either by avoiding the vigilance of the guards, or by purchasing a connivance. The population of Coro is composed of 10,000 people of all colours ; few slaves are to be seen here, since the Indians, although they everywhere else have a particular partiality for the blacks, entertain a decided aversion against them in this city. This antipathy was very useful in 1797 to the public tranquillity, for when the Negro slaves employed at work in the fields, wished to follow the example of the blacks of St. Domingo, and selected chiefs, under whom they committed some robberies, the Indians of Coro joined the white people, and marched against the rebels with most extraordinary courage ; the revolt was thus suppressed almost as soon as it broke out ; the ringleaders were hanged, and every thing was restored to order ; the rebel army never amounted to more than 400 blacks. All work at Coro is done by Indians, notwithstanding the wages are very low ; indeed they live here with so much parsimony that a person cannot fetch fire from his neighbour's without carrying in exchange a piece of wood of the size of the firing he takes away, and even this is not always done without difficulty. The city has no spring, and the water they drink is brought from the distance of half a league by asses in barrels, of which two compose a load. The houses, though originally well built, bear evident marks of misery, and of the ravages of time; those belonging to the Indians are yet more pitiful. The streets run in parallel lines, but are not paved ; the public buildings consist of a parish church, formerly a cathedral, which title is yet given to it by the inhabitants, although for more than 160 years it has been without a bishop or a chapter, the duty being performed by two curates, belonging to a convent containing about seven or eight Franciscans, and to a parish church in which are three monks of the same order. The civil power is exercised by a cabildo. Since 1799, a military commandant has been established here, who shares at the same time the judicatory authority, and that of the police ; his revenue being 2000 dollars per annum. Two miles to the n. of Coro is an isthmus of about one league in breadth, which joins the peninsula of Paragona to the continent ; itstretches out from the s. w. to n. w. about 20 leagues ; is inhabited by Indians and a few whites, whose only employment is the rearing of cattle, which they smuggle over in great numbers to Curacoa ; the butchers' shops of that island being always better supplied than those of the principal cities of Tierra Fivme. COR  This was the only city of Venezuela, except Maracaibo, which had not declared independence on the 21st August 1811. See Venezuela. The city is in lat. 11° 24' n. and long. 69° 40'; it is a league distant from the sea, 80 leagues w. of Caracas, 33 n. of Barquisimeto, and 55 of Maracaibo.]

The whole of its territory is, as it Were, unknown. The Portuguese possess the shores of the Marafion and the seacoast as far as the bay of Vicente Pinzon; the Dutch of the colony of Surinam, by the river Esequevo or Esquivo, called also Rupununi, have penetrated as far as the Marafion, by the river Paranapitinga. The mountains, which some have represented as being full of gold, silver, and precious stones, sparkling in the rays of the sun, are merely fables, which, at the beginning of the conquests, deceived many who had gone in search of these rich treasures, and fell a sacrifice to the fatigues and labours which they experienced in these dry and mountainous countries. The Portuguese have constructed here two forts, called Paru and Macapa. Mr. De la Martiniere, with his usual want of accuracy, says that the Portuguese have a settlement called Coropa, at the mouth of the river Coropatuba, where it enters the Marafion : the Coropatuba joins the Marafion on the n. side, in the country of Coropa, and at the. settlement of this name ; this settlement being nothing more than a small fort, and lying in the province of Topayos, on the s. shore of the Marafion, and being known by the name of Curupa, in the chart published in 1744, and in that of the Father Juan Magnin, in 1749.

==[[Craven|CRAVEN]]==, a county ofthe province and colony of Carolina in N. America, situate on the shore of the river Congaree, which divides the province into South and North. It is fiiled with English and French protestants. The latter of these disembarked here to establish themselves in 170S, but were routed, and the greater part put to death by the hands of the former. The river Sewee waters this county, and its first establishment was owing to some families who had come hither from New England. It has no large city nor any considerable town, but has two forts upon the river Santc, the one called Sheniningh fort, which is 45 miles from the entrance or mouth of the river, and the other called Congaree, 65 miles from the other. [It contains 10,469 inhabitants, of whom 3658 are slaves.}  ■==[[Craven|CRAVO]]==, Santa Barbara de, a settlement of the jurisdiction of Santiago delas Atalayas, of the Government of Los Llanos of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada. It is on the shore of the large river of its name, upon a very pleasant mountain plain, very near to the llanura at the bottom of the mountain, and where formerly stood the city of San Joseph de Cravo, founded by the governor of this province in 1644, but which was soon afterdestroyed. The temperature here is not so hot as in the other parts of the province, from its being, as we have before observed, in the vicinity of the paramos of mountain deserts. It produces in abundance maize, plantains, and yucas, of which is made the best cazave of any in the kingdom, also many trees of a hard and strong wood^, used as a medicine in spotted fevers, and a specific against poisons, so that it is much esteemed, and they make of it drinking cups. Here are other trees, good for curing the flux, their virtue in this disorder having been accidentally discovered as follows. A labourer, as he was cutting down one of these trees, let his hatchet fall upon his foot ; but remembering that by pressing his foot against the tree it would stop the blood, he did so, and a splinter thus getting into the wound, the cut soon healed without the application of any other remedy. Here are large breeds of horned cattle, and the natives, who should amount to 100 Indians, and about as many whites, are much given to agriculture. Eight leagues from the settlement of Morcote.

[==[[Creeks|CREEKS]]==, an Indian nation, described also under the name of Muskogulge or Muskogee, in addition to which is the following particulars, from the manuscript journal of an intelligent traveller : " Coosa river, and its main branches, form the w. line of settlements or villages of the Creeks, but their hunting grounds extend 200 miles be-    yond, to the Tombigbee, which is the dividing line between their country and that of the Chactaws. The smallest of their towns have from 20 to 30 houses in them, and some of them contain from 150 to 200, that are wholly compact. The houses stand in clusters of four, five, six, seven, and eight together, irregularly distributed up and down the banks of the rivers or small streams, Each cluster of houses contains a clan or family of relations, who eat and live in common. Each town has a public square, hothouse, and yard near the centre of it, ■ appropriated to various public The following are the names of the prin-  uses.  cipal towns of the Upper and Lower Creeks that have public squares ; beginning at the head of the Coosa or Coosa Hatch a river, viz. Upper Utalas, Abbacoochees, Natchez, Coosas, Oteetoocheenas, Pine Catchas, Pocuntullahases, Weeokes, Little Tallassie, Tuskeegees, Coosadas, Alabamas, Tawasas, Pawactas, Autobas, Auhoba, Weelumpkecs Big,Weelumpkees Little, Wacacoys, Wacksoy, Ochees. The following towns are in the central, inland, and high country, between the Coosa and Tallapoosee rivers, in the district called the Hillabees, viz. Hillabees, Killeegko, Oakchoys, Slakagulgas, and Wacacoys ; on the waters of the Tallapoosee, from the head of the river downward, the following, viz. Tuckabatchee, Tehassa, Totacaga, New York, Chalaacpauiley, L'oguspogus, Oakfuskee, Ufala Little, Ufala Big, Sogahatches,Tuckabatchees, Big Tallassee or Halfway House, Clewaleys, Coosahatches, Coolamies, Shawanese or Savanas, Kenhulka, and Muckeleses. The towns of the Lower Creeks, beginning on the head waters of the Chattahoosee, and so on downwards, areChelu Ninny, Chattahoosee, Hohiatoga y Cowetas, Cussitahs, Cbalagatscaor, Broken Arrow, Euchees several, Hitchatees several, Palachuolo, Chewackala ; besides 20 town,s and villages of the Little and Big Chehaus, low down on Flint and Chattahoosee rivers. From their roving and unsteady manner of living, it is impossible to determine, with much precision, the number of Indians that compose the Creek nation. General M'Gillivray estimates the number of gunmen to be between 5 and 6000, exclusive of the Seminoles, who are of little or.no account in war, except as small parties of marauders, acting independent of the general interest of the others. The whole number of individuals may be about 25 or 26,000 souls. Every town and village has one established white trader in it, and generally a family of whites, who have fled from some part of the frontiers. They often, to have revenge, and to obtain plunder that may be taken, use their influence to send out pre- 3 y 2  i  C R E  datory parties against the settlements in their vicinity. The Creeks are very badly armed, having few rifles, and are mostly armed with muskets. For near 40 years past, the Creek Indians have had little intercourse with any other foreigners but those of the English nation. Their prejudice in favour of every thing English, has been carefully kept alive by tories and others to this day. Most of their towns have now in their possession British drums, with the arms of the nation and other emblems painted on them, and some of their squaws preserve the remnants of British flags. They still believe that " the great king over the water" is able to keep the whole world in subjection. The land of the country is a common stock ; and any individual may remove from one part of it to another, and occupy vacant ground where he can find it. The country is naturally divided into three districts, viz. the Upper Creeks, Lower and Middle Creeks, and Seminoles. The upper district includes all the waters of the Tallapoosee, Coosahatchee, and Alabama rivers, and is called the Abbacoes. The lower or middle district includes all the waters of the Chattahoosee and Flint rivers, down to their junction ; and although occupied by a great number of different tribes, the whole are called Cowetaulgas or Coweta people, from the Cowetan town and tribe, the most warlike and ancient of any in the whole nation. The lower or s. district takes in the river Appalachicola, and extends to the point of E. Florida, and is called the Country of the Seminoles. Agriculture is as far advanced with the Indians as it can well be, without the proper implements of husbandry. A very large majority of the nation being devoted to hunting in the winter, and to war or idleness in summer, cultivate but small parcels of ground, barely sufficient for subsistence. But many individuals, (particularly on Flint river, among the Chehaws, who possess numbers of Negroes) have fenced fields, tolerably well cultivated. Haying no ploughs, they break up the ground with hoes, and scatter the seed promiscuously over the ground in hills, but not in rows. They raise horses, cattle, fowls, and hogs. The only nrlicles they manufacture are earthen pots and pans, baskets, horseropes or halters, smoked leather, black marble pipes, wooden spoons, and oil from acorns, hickery nuts, and chesnuts.] [Cheek:?, confederated nations of Indians.

[CROWN Point is the most s. township in Clinton county, New York, so called from the celebrated fortress which is in it, and which was garrisoned by the British troops, fromthe time of its reduction by General Amherst, in 1759, till the late revolution. It was taken by the Americans the 14th of May 1775, and retaken by the British the year after. The point upon which it was erected by the French in 173 1, extends n. into lake Champ- Iain. It was called Kruyn Punt, or Scalp Point, by the Dutch, and by the French, Pointea-la- Chevelure ; the fortress they named Fort St. Frederick. After it was repaired by the British, it was the most regular and expensive of any constructed by them in America ; tfie walls are of wood and earth, about J 6 feet high and about 20 feet thick, nearly 150 yards square, and surrounded by a deep and broad ditch dug out of the solid rock ; the only gate opened on the n. towards the lake, where was a drawbridge and a covert way, to secure a communication with the waters of the lake, in case of a siege. On the right and left, as you enter the fort, is a row of stone barracks, not elegantly built, which are capable of containing 2000 troops. There were formerly several outworks, which are now in ruins, as is indeed the case with the principal fort, except the walls of the barracks. The famous fortification called Ticonderoga is 15 miles s. of this, but that fortress is also so much demolished, that a stranger would scarcely form an idea of its original construction.

CRUZ.  ==[[Cruz|CRUZ]]==, Santa, de la Sierra, a province r.nd government of Peru, bounded n. by that of Moxos, e. by the territory of the Chiquitos Indians, s. by the infidel Chiriguanos and Chanaes Indians, s, to. by the province of Tomina, and no. by that of Mizque. It is an extensive plain, which on the w. side is covered with Indian dwellings and grazing farms, as far as the river called Grande or Huapay. It extends 28 leagues s. as far as the same river, IS a?, as far as the foot of the cordillera, and 24 n. being altogether covered with various estates, as indeed are the parts on the other side of the cordillera. It lies very low, and is free both from the extreme cold and parching heat of the serraiiias, although the other provinces of this bishopric, which lie close by this province, arc much infested with the same variations of climate. It is, however, of a hot and moist temperature, and the country is mountainous; on its plains are found various kinds of v/ood, good for building, and amongst the rest, a sort of palm, the heart of which is used for making the frame works to windows of temples and houses, and it is generally cut to the length of 11 feet ; there is another kind of palm, which is called montaqui, the leaves of which serve for covering the bouses of the poor, and the shoots or buds for making a very argreeable sallad ; the heart of the tree is reduced to a flour, of which sweet cakes are made, and eaten instead of bread, for in this province neither wheat nor vines are cultivated, the climate being unfavourable to both. It abounds in various species of canes, which serve to bind together the timbers of which the houses are constructed ; one of these species is called huembe, with which bells, though of gvcat weight, are hung. In this province are all kinds of fruits, various birds, tigers, bears, wild boars, deer, and other wild animals ; amongst the fruits of the wild trees are some which grow, not upon the branches, but upon the trunk itself; that which is called Iwnipuru resembles a large cherry in colour and flavour, and this, as well as others which are equally well tasted, serve as food for an infinite variety of birds ; an equal abundance of fish is likewise found in the neighbouring rivers. Here is cultivated rice, also maize, "sugarcane, yucas, camotes, Sec. and some wild wax is found in the trunks of trees ; being furnished by various kinds of bees. At the distance of 20 leagues to the s. of the capital, are four settlements of Chiriguanos Indians, governed by their own captains, but subject, in some measure, to this government, from being in friendship with it, and trading with the Spaniards in wax, cotton, and maize. Hitherto its natives have been  averse to embracing the Catholic religion, but in the incursions that "have been made against us by the barbarians, they have been ever ready to lend us their assistance, and in fact form for us an outwork of defence. In the aforesaid four settlements are 500 Indians, who are skilled in the use of the arrow and the lance, and are divided from the other barbarians of the same nation by the river Grande or Huapay. This river runs from Charcas to the e. by the side of the province of Tomina, and which, after making a bend in the figure of an halfmoon, on the e. side of the province of Santa Cruz, enters the Marmore, first receivinganother river describing a similar course, and known by the name of the Pirapiti. On the s. e. and on the opposite side, are some settlements of Chanaes Indians, the territory of whom is called Isofo. To the s. and s. w. towards the frontiers of Tarija, and still further on, are very many settlements of the infidel Chiriguanos Indians ; and in the valley of lngre alone,"Avhich is eight leagues long, we find 26°; and in some of these the religious Franciscan order of the college of Tarija have succeeded in making converts, though as yet in no considerable numbers. These Indians are the most valorous, perfidious, and inconstant of all the nations lying to the e. of the river Paraguay ; 4000 of them once fled for fearof meeting chastisement for their having traitorously put to death the Captain Alexo Garcia, a Portuguese, in the time of Don Juan III. king of Portugal; they were cannibals, and used to fatten their prisoners before they killed them for their banquets. Their treaties with the Spaniards, and the occasional visits these have been obliged to pay them in their territories, have induced them nearly to forget this abominable practice ; but their innate cruelty still exists, and particularly against the neighbouring nations, upon whom they look down with the greatest scorn ; they have increased much, and are now one of the most numerous nations in America ; they are extremely cleanly, so much so that they will ffo down to the rivers to wash themselves even at mid night, and in the coldest season. The women also, immediately after parturition, plunge themselves into the water, and coming home, lay themselves down upon a little mound of sand, which, for this purpose, they have in their houses. The inhabitants of this province amount to 16,000, and besides the capital, which is San Lorenzo de la Frontera, there are only the following settlements : Porongo,

Cruz, Santa, an island oftheN. sea, one of the Antilles, 22 leagues long and five wide. Its territory is fertile, but the air unhealthy at certain seasons, from the low situation. It has many rivers, streams, and fountains, with three very good and convenient ports. It was for a long while desert, until some English settled themselves in it, and began to cultivate it ; afterwards the French possessed themselves of it, in 1650, and sold it the following year to the knights of Malta, from whom it was bought, in 1664, by the West India company. In 1674, it was incorporated with the possessions of the crown by the king of France. Its inhabitants afterwards removed to the island of St. Domingo, demolished the forts, and sold it to a company of Danes, of Copenhagen, who now possess it. It was the first of the Antilles which was occupied by the Spaniards ; is SO leagues   from the island of St. Christopher's, eight from Puertorico, six from that of Boriquen, and five from that of St. Thomas. It abounds in sugarcane and tobacco, as also in fruits, which render it very delightful. [It is said to produce 50,000 or 40,000 hhds. of sugar annually, and other W. India commodities, in tolerable plenty. It is in a high state of cultivation, and has about 3000 white inhabitants and 30,000 slaves. A great proportion of the Negroes of this island have embraced Christianity, under the Moravian missionaries, whose influence has been greatly promotive of its prosperity.

To the n. it has Florida and the Lucayes isles ; to the e. the island of St. Domingo, and to the s. the island of Jamaica, and the s. continent ; and to the w. the gulf or bay of Mexico. It is between 19° 48' and 23 6 15' n.

In the year 1494, it was found to be an island by Nicholas de Obando. He measured its circumference, and careened his vessel in the port of the Havana, which from that time has been 3 z 2  !•»  iV    !    540  

CUBA.  known by the name of Carenas. It is of a kind, ■warm, and dry temperature, and more mild than the island of St. Domingo, owing to the refreshing gales which it experiences from'the n. and e. Its rivers, which are in number 158, abound in rich fish ; its mountains in choice and vast timber ; namely cedars, caobas, oaks, granadilhs, guaj/acanes, and ebonytrees ; the fields in singing birds, and others of the chase, in flourishing trees and odoriferous plants. The territory is most fertile, so that the fields are never without flowers, and the trees are never stripped of their foliage. Some of the seeds produce two crops a year, the one of them ripening in the depth of winter. At the beginning of its conquest, much gold was taken from hence, and principally in the parts called, at the present day, Iagua, and the city of Trinidad ; and the chronicler Antonio de Herera affirms that this metal was found of greater purity here than in the island of St. Domingo. Some of it is procured at the present day at Holguin. Here are some very abundant mines of copper and loadstone ; and artillery was formerly cast here, similar to that which was in the fortified places of the Havana, Cuba, and the castle of the Pflorro. Here was established an asiento of the mines, under the reign of the King Don Juan deEguiluz, when no less aquantity than 1000 quintals of gold were sent yearly (o Spain. In the jurisdiction of the Havana, an iron mine has been discovered some little time since, of an excellent quality, and the rock crystal found here is, when wrought, more brilliant than the finest stones. In the road from Bayamo to Cuba, are found pebbles of various sizes, and so perfectly round that they might be well used for cannonballs. The baths of medical warm waters are extremely numerous in this island. It contains 1 1 large and convenient bays, very secure ports, and abundant salt ponds, also 480 sugar engines, from which upwards of a million of arrobas are embarked every year for Europe, and of such an esteemed and excellent quality, as without being refined, to equal the sugar of Holland or France; not to mention the infinite quantity of this article employed in the manufacturing of delicious sweetmeats : these being also sent over to Spain and various parts of America. It contains also 9S2 herds of large cattle, 617 inclosures for swine, 350 folds for fattening animals, 1881 manufactories, and 5933 cultivated estates ; and but for the want of hands, it might be said to abound in every necessary of life, since it produces in profusion yucas, sweet and bitter, and of which the cazave bread is made, coffee, maize, indigo, cotton, some cacao and much tobacco of excellent quality ; this being  one of the principal sources of its commerce, and that which forms the chief branch of the royal revenue. This article is exported to Europe in every fashion, in leaf, snuff', and cigars, and is held superior to the tobacco of all the other parts of America. The great peculiarity of this climate is, that we find in it, the whole year round, the most delicate herbs and fruits, in full season, native cither to Europe or these regions ; and amongst the rest, the pine is most delicious. The fields are so delightful and so salutary, that invalids go to reside in them to establish their health. Throughout the whole island there is neither wild beast or venomous animal to be found. Its first inhabitants were a pacific and modest people, and unacquainted with the barbarous custom of eating human flesh, and abhorring theft and impurity. These have become nearly extinct, and the greater part of them hung themselves at the beginning of the conquest, through vexation at the hardships inflicted upon them by the first settlers. At the present day, the natives are the most active and industrious of any belonging to the Antilles islands. The women, although they have not the complexion of Europeans, are beautiful, lively, affable, of acute discernment, lovers of virtue, and extremely hospitable and generous. The first town of this island was Baracoa, built by Diego Velazquez in 1512. It is divided into two governments, which are that of Cuba and that of the Havana : these are subdivided into jurisdictions and districts. The governor of the Havana is the captaingeneral of the whole island, and his command extends as far as the provinces of Louisiana and Movila ; and his appointment has ever been looked upon as a situation of the highest importance and confidence. He is assisted by general officers of the greatest abilities and merits in the discharge of his office. When the appointment becomes vacant, the viceroy of the Havana, through a privilege, becomes invested with the title of Captain-General in ihe government. The whole of the island is one diocese ; its jurisdiction comprehending the provinces of Louisiana, and having the title of those of Florida and the island of Jamaica. It is suffragan to the archbishopric of St. Domingo, erected in Baracoa in 1518, and translated to Cuba by bull of Pope Andrian VI. in 1522. It numbers 21 parishes, 90 churches, 52 curacies, 23 convents, 3 colleges, and 22 hospitals. In 1763 some swarms of bees were brought from San Agustin de La Florida, which have increased to such a degree, that the wax procured from them, after reserving enough for the consumption of all the superior class, and independently of that used in the    CUBA.  churches for divine worship, was exported, in 1776, to the quantity of 12,550 arrobas, from a single port of the Havana ; and all of it of as good a quality as is the wax of Venice. Although the capital of this island is the city of its name, the Havana is, at the present day, looked upon as the principal. Here the governor and captaingeneral of the kingdom resides ; and it lias gained this preference from the excellence of its port, and from other qualifications, which will be found treated of under that article. We must here confine ourselves to what we have already said, a more diffuse account not corresponding to our plan, though, and if all were said of which the subject would admit, a very extensive history might be made. The population consists of the following cities, towns, and places.

[Cuba, which, in 1774, contained only 171,628 inhabitants, including 44,328 slaves, and from 5 to 6000 free Negroes, possessed, in 1804, a population of 432,000 souls. The same island, in 1792, exported only 400,000 quintals of sugar ; but, in 1804, its annual exportation of that article had risen to 1,000,000 of quintals. By a statement, of the export of sugar from the Havana, from 1801 to 1810 inclusive, it appears that the average for the last 10 years has been 2,850,000 arrobas, or about 614,000 cwt. a year.

The number of Negroes introduced into Cuba, from 1789 to 1803, exceeded 76,000 souls ; and during the last four years of that period, they amounted to 34,500, or to more than 8600 annually. Accordingly, the population of the island, in 1804, consisted of 108,000 slaves, and 324,000 free persons, of whom 234,000 were whites, and 90,000 free blacks and people of colour. The white population of Cuba forms therefore T 5 ^, or .54 of the whole number of its inhabitants. In Caracas, the whites constitute .20 of the total population ; in New Spain almost .19; in Peru .12; and in Jamaica .10. 
In speaking of the origin, manners, and customs, &amp;c. of the natives of Cuba, we are to be understood as giving also an account of those of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico ; for there is no doubt that the inhabitants of all those islands were of one common origin ; speaking the same language, possessing the same institutions, and practising similar superstitions. The fairest calculation as to their numbers, when first discovered, is 3,000,000. But, not to anticipate observations that will more properly appear hereafter, we shall now proceed to the consideration, — 1. Of their persons and personal endowments.— 2. Their intellectual f acuities and dispositions.— 3. Their political institutions. — 4. Their religious riles. — 5. Their arts. 
1. Persons. — Both men and women wore nothing more than a slight covering of cotton cloth round the waist; but in the women it extended to the knees : the children of both sexes appeared entirely naked. In stature they were taller, but less robust than the Caribes. Their colour was a clear brown, not deeper in general, according to Columbus, than that of a Spanish peasant who has been much exposed to the wind and the sun. Like the Caribes, they altered the natural configuration of the head in infancy ; but after a different mode (the sinciput, or forepart of the head from the eyebrows to the coronal suture, was depressed, which gave an unnatural thickness and elevation to the occiput, or hinder part ofthe skull); and by this practice, says Herrera, the crown was so srengthened that a Spanish broadsword, instead of cleaving the skull at a stroke, would frequently break short upon it ; an illustration which gives an admirable idea ofthe clemency of their conquerors! Their hair was uniformly black,. without any tendency to curl ; their features were hard and unsightly; the face broad, and the nose flat; but their eyes streamed with good nature, and altogether there was something pleasing and inviting in the countenances of most of them, which pro-]  CUBA.  
[claimed a frank find gentle disposition. It was an honest face, (says Martyr), coarse, but not gloomy ; for it was enlivened by confidence, and softened by compassion. Amongst our islanders, an attachment to the sex was remarkably conspicuous. Love, with this happy people, was not a transient and youthful ardour only • but the source of all their pleasures, and the chief business of life : for not being, like the Caribes, oppressed by the weight of perpetual solicitude, and tormented by an unquenchable thirst of revenge, they gave full indulgence to the instincts of nature, while the influence of the climate heightened the sensibility of  the passions. See Oviedo, lib. v. c. 3  
We  have nearly the same account at this day of the Arrowauks of Guayana. " In their natural disposition (says Bancroft) they are amorous and wanton :" and Barrere observes, " Us sont lubriques au supreme digfe." It is related by Herrera, that a deity similar to the Venus of antiquity, was one of the divinities of the Tlascalans, a people of Mexico. In truth, an excessive sensuality was among the greatest defects in their character: and to this cause alone is imputed, by some writers, the origin of that dreadful disease, with the infliction of which they have almost revenged the calamities brought upon them by the avarice of Europe; if indeed the venereal contagion was first introduced into Spain from these islands ; a conclusion to which, notwithstanding all that has been written in support of it, an attentive inquirer will still hesitate to subscribe. Their agility was eminently conspicuous in their dances, wherein they delighted and excelled, devoting the cool hours of night to this employment. " It was their custom (says Herrera) to dance from evening to the dawn ; and although 50,000 men and women were frequently assembled together on these occasions, they seemed actuated by one common impulse, keeping time by responsive motions of their hands, feet, and bodies, with an exactness that was wonderful. These public dances (for they had others highly licentious) were appropriated to particular solemnities, and being accompanied with historical songs, were called arietoes ; a singular feature in their political institutions, of which we shall presently speak. Besides the exercise of dancing, another diversion was prevalent among them, which they called bato; and it appears from the account given of it by the Spanish historians, that it had a distant resemblance to the English game of cricket ; for the players were divided into two parties, which alternately changed places, and the sport consisted in dexterously throwing and returning an elastic ball from one p:irfy to the other.  
It was not however caught iu the hand, or returned with an instrument, but received on the head, the elbow, or the foot: and the dexterity and force with which it was thence repelled, were astonishing and inimitable. Such exertions belong not to a people incurably enervated and slothful. 
2. Intellects The benevolence of these Indians, unexampled in the history of civilized nations, was soon basely requited by the conduct of a band of robbers, whom Columbus unfortunately left in the island, on his departure for Europe. When any of the Spaniards came near to a village, the most ancient and venerable of the Indians, or the cacique himself, if present, came out to meet them, and gently conducted them into their habitations, and seated them on stools of ebony curiously ornamented. These benches seem to have been seats of honour reserved for their guests; for the Indians threw themselves on the ground, and kissing the hands and feet of the Spaniards, offered them fruits and the choicest of their viands ; entreating them to prolong their stay, with such solicitude and reverence as demonstrated that they considered them as beings of a superior nature, whose presence consecrated their dwellings, and brought a blessing with it. The reception which Bartholomew Columbus, who was appointed lieutenant, or deputygovernor, in the absence of the admiral, afterwards met with, in his progress through the island to levy tributes from the several caciques or princes, manifested not only kindness and submission, but on many occasions munificence, and even a high degree of politeness. These caciques had all heard of the wonderful eagerness of the strangers for gold ; and such of them as possessed any of this precious metal, willingly presented all that they had to the deputygovernor. Others, who had not the means of obtaining gold, brought provisions and cotton in great abundance. Among the latter was Behechio, a powerful cacique, who invited the lieutenant and his attendants to his dominions; and the entertainment which they received from this hospitable chief is thus described by Martyr. " As they approached the king's dwelling, they were met by his wives, to the number of SO, carrying branches of the palmtree in their hands, who first saluted the Spaniards with a solemn dance, accompanied with a general song. These matrons were succeeded by a train of virgins, distinguished as such by their appearance ; the former wearing aprons of cotton cloth, while the latter were arrayed oniy in the innocence of pure nature. Their hair was tied simply with a fillet over their foreheads, or suffered to flow gracefully on their shoulders and bo-]  

CUBA.  [soms. Their limbs were finely proportioned, and their complexions, though brown, were smooth, shining, and lovely. The Spaniards were struck with admiration, believing that they beheld the dryads of the woods, and the nymphs of the fountains, realizing ancient fable. The branches which they bore in their hands, they now delivered with lowly obeisance to the lieutenant, who, entering the palace, found a plentiful, and, according to the Indian mode of living, a splendid repast already provided. As night approached, the Spaniards were conducted to separate cottages, wherein each of them was accommodated with a cotton hammoc; and the next morning they were again entertained with dancing and singing. This was followed by matches of wrestling, and running for prizes ; after which two great bodies of armed Indians unexpectedly appeared, and a mock engagement ensued ; exhibiting their modes of attack and defence in their wars with the Caribes. For three days were the Spaniards thus royally entertained, and on the fourth the affectionate Indians regretted their departure." 
3. Political institutions.— -Their kings, as we have seen, were called caciques, and their power was hereditary. But there Avere also subordinate chieftains, or princes, who were tributaries to the sovereign of each district. Thus the territory in Hispaniola, anciently called Xaraguay, extending from the plain of Leoganeto the westernmost part of the island, was the kingdom of the cacique Behechio; but it appears from "Martyr, that no less than 32 inferior chieftains or nobles had jurisdiction within that space of country, who were accountable to the supreme authority of Behechio. They seem to have somewhat resembled the ancient barons or feudatories of Europe; holding their possessions by the tenure of service. Oviedo relates, that they were under the obligation of personally attending the sovereign, both in peace and war, whenever commanded so to do. The whole island of Hispaniola was divided into five great kingdoms. The islands of Cuba and Jamaica were divided, like Hispaniola, into many principalities or kingdoms ; but we are told that the whole extent of Puerto Rico was subject to one cacique only. It has been remarked, that the dignity of these chieftians was hereditary ; but if Martyr is to be credited, the law of succession among them was different from that of all other people ; for he observes, that the caciques bequeathed the supreme authority to the children of their sisters, according to seniority, disinheriting their own offspring ; « being certain," adds Martyr, « that, by this policy, they preferred the blood royal; which  might not happen to be the case in advancing any of "the children of their numerous wives." The relation of Oviedo is somewhat different, and seems more probable : he remarks, that one of the wives of each cacique was particularly distinguished above the rest, and appears to have been considered by the people at large as the reigning queen ; that the children of this lady, according to priority of birth, succeeded to the father's honours; but, in default of issue by the favourite princess, the sisters of the cacique, if there were no surviving brothers, took place of the cacique's own children by his other wives. The principal cacique was distinguished by regal ornaments and numerous attendants. In travelling through his dominions, he was commonly borne on men's shoulders, after a manner very much resembling the use of the palanquin in the E. Indies. According to Martyr, he was regarded by all his subjects with such reverence, as even exceeded the bounds of nature and reason ; for if he ordered any of them to cast themselves headlong from a high rock, or to drown themselves in the sea, alleging no cause but his sovereign pleasure, he was obeyed without a murmur ; opposition to the supreme authority being considered not only as unavailing, but impious. Nor did their veneration terminate with the life of the prince ; it was extended to his memory after death; a proof that his authority, however extravagant, was seldom abused. When a cacique died, his body was embowelled, and dried in an oven moderately heated ; so that the bones and even the skin were preserved entire. The corpse was then placed in a cave with those of his ancestors, this being (observes Oviedo) among these simple people the only system of heraldry ; whereby they intended to render, not the name alone, but the persons also, of their worthies immortal. If a cacique was slain in battle, and the body could not be recovered, they composed songs in his praise, which they taught their children. It is related by Martyr, that on the death of a cacique, the most beloved of his wives was immolated at his funeral. Thus he observes that Anacaona, on the death of her brother, King Behechio, ordered a very beautiful woman, whose name was Guanahata Benechina, to be buried alive in the cave where his body (after being dried as above mentioned) was deposited. But Oviedo, though by no means partial towards the Indian character, denies that this custom was general among them. Anacaona, who had been married to a Caribe, probably adopted the practice from the account she had received from her husband of his national customs; and it is not impossible, under a female adminis-]

[tration, (among savages), but that the extraordinary beauty of the unfortunate victim contributed to her destruction. These heroic effusions constituted a branch of solemnities, called arieloes ; consisting of hymns and public dances, accompanied with musical instruments made of shells, and a sort of drum, the sound of which was heard at a vast distance. It is pretended that among the traditions publicly recited, there was one of a prophetic nature, denouncing ruin and desolation by the arrival of strangers completely clad, and armed with the lightning of heaven. 
6. Religious rites. — Like all other unenlightened nations, these poor Indians were indeed the slaves of superstition. Their general theology (for they had an established system, and a priesthood to support it), Avas a medley of gross folly and childish traditions, the progeny of ignorance and terror. Historians have preserved a remarkable speech of a venerable old man, a native of Cuba, who, approaching Christopher Columbus with great reverence, and presenting a basket of fruit, addressed him as follows. " Whether you are divinities," observed he, " or mortal men, we know not. You are come into these countries with a force, against which, were we inclined to resist it, resistance would be folly. We are all therefore at your mercy ; but if you are men, subject to mortality like ourselves, you cannot be unapprised, that after this life there is another, wherein a very different portion is allotted to good and bad men. Tf therefore you expect to die, and believe with us, that every one is to be rewarded in a future state, according to his conduct in the present, you will do no hurt to those who do none to you." This remarkable circumstance happened on the 7th of July 14S4, and is attested by Pet. Martyr, Decad. i. lib. iii. and by Herrera, lib. ii. c. 14. li it be asked how Columbus understood the cacique, the answer is, that he had carried with him to Spain, in his former voyage, several of the Indians ; one of whom, a native of Guanahani, who had remained with him from October 1492, had acquired the Spanish language. This man, whose name was Didacus, served him, on this and other occasions, both as a guide and interpreter. Their notions of future happiness seem however to have been narrow and sensual. They supposed that the spirits of good men were conveyed to a pleasant valley, which they called coy aba ; a place of indolent tranquillity, abounding with delicious fruits, cool shades, and murmuring rivulets ; in a country where drought never rages, and the hurricane is never felt. In this seat of bliss (the Elysium of antiquity), they believed that their greatest enjoy-  ment would arise from the company of their departed ancestors, and o' those persons who were dear to them in lite. Although, like the Caribes, our islanders acknowledged" a plurality of gods, like them too they believed in the existence of one supreme, invisible, immortal, and omnipotent Creator, whom they named Jocahuna. But unhappily, with these important truths, these poor people blended the most puerile and extravagant fancies, which were neither founded in rational piety, nor productive of moral obligation. They assigned to the supreme Being a father and mother, whom they distinguished by a variety of names, and they supposed the sun and moon to be (he chief seats of their residence. Their system of idolworship was, at the same time, more lamentable than even that of the Caribes ; lor it would seem that they paid divine honours to stocks and stones converted into images, which they called zemi ; not regarding these idols as symbolical representations only of their subordinate divinities, and useful as sensible objects, to awaken the memory and animate devotion, but ascribing divinity to the material itself, and actually worshipping the rude stone or block which their own hands had fashioned. Their idols were universally hideous and frightful, sometimes respresenting toads anc other odious reptiles ; but more frequently the human face horribly distorted ; a proof that they considered them, not as benevolent, but evil powers ; as objects of terror, not of admiration and love. To keep alive this sacred and awful prejudice in the minds of the multitude, and heighten its influence, their hohiios or priests appropriated a consecrated house in each village, wherein the zemi was invoked and worshipped. Nor was it permitted to the people at large, at all times to enter, and on unimportant occasions approach the dread object of their adoration. The bohitos undertook to be their messengers and interpreters, and by the efficacy of their prayers to avert the dangers which they dreaded. The ceremonies exhibited an these solemnities were well calculated to extend the priestly dominion, and confirm the popular subjection. In the same view, the bohitos added to their holy profession the practice of physic, and they claimed likewise the privilege of educating the children of the first rank of people; a combination of influence which, extending to the nearest and dearest concerns both of this life and the next, rendered their authority irresistible. Religion was here made the instrument of civil despotism, and the will of the cacique, if confirmed by the priest, was impiously pronounced the decree of heaven. Columbus relates, that some of his people entering J  

CUBA.  [unexpectedly into one of their houses of worship, found the cacique employed in obtaining responses from the zemi. By the sound of the voice which came from the idol, they knew that it was hollow, and dashing it to the ground to expose the imposture, they discovered a tube which was before covered with leaves, that communicated from the back part of the image to an inner apartment, whence the priest issued his precepts as through a speaking trumpet ; but the cacique earnestly entreated them to say nothing of what they had seen, declaring that by means of such pious frauds, he collected tributes, and kept his kingdom in subjection. Happily, however, the general system of their superstition, though not amiable, was not cruel. We find among them but few of those barbarous ceremonies which filled the Mexican temples with pollution, and the spectators with horror. 
5„ Their arts. — Our islanders had not only the skill of making excellent cloth from their cotton, but they practised also the art of dyeing it with a variety of colours ; some of them of the utmost brilliancy and beauty. The piraguas were fully sufficient for the navigation they were employed in, and indeed were by no means contemptible seaboats. We are told that some of these vessels were navigated with forty oars ; and Herrera relates, that Bartholomew Columbus, in passing through the gulf of Honduras, fell in with one that was eight feet in breadth, and in length equal to a Spanish galley. Over the middle was an awning, composed of mats and palmtree leaves; underneath which were disposed the women and children, secured both from rain and the spray of the sea. It was laden with commodities from Yucatan. These vessels were built either of cedar, or the great cottontree hollowed, and made square at each end like punts. Their gunnels were raised with canes braced close, and smeared over with some bituminous substance to render them watertight, and they had sharp keels. Our islanders far surpassed most other savage nations in the elegance and variety of their domestic utensils and furniture, their earthenware, curiously woven beds, and implements of husbandry. Martyr speaks with admiration of the workmanship of some of the former of these. In the account he gives of a magnificent donation from Anacoana to Bartholomew Columbus, on his first visit to that princess, he observes, that among other valuables she presented him with 14 chairs of ebony beautifully wrought, and no less than 60 vessels of different sorts, for the use of his kitchen and table, all of which were ornamented with figures of various kinds, fantastic forms, and accurate representations of living animals. The industry and ingenuity of our Indians therefore must have greatly exceeded the measure of their wants.]

Cuba, with the dedicatory title of Santiago, a capital city of the former island, founded by Diego Velazquez in 1511, with a good port defended by a casile, called the Morro, as is that of the Havana. It is the head of a bishopric suffragan to the archbishopric of St. Domingo, erected in 1518. It has a convent of the religious order of St. Domingo, and another of St. Francis ; it was at first populous and rich, and even at one time contained 2000 housekeepers, but since that a commerce was established in the Havana^ through the excellence of its port, and .that their captaingeneral and the bishop have fixed their 4 a 2  
M8  c u c  cue  residences here, it has fallen into decay ; and although it is now reduced to a small town, the title of Capital has not been taken from it. Its only inhabitants are those who own some estates in its district, and this forms a government subordinate to that of the Havana. [The damage done by the earthquake of October 1810, to the shipping at the Havana, was computed at 600,000 dollars ; the injury at St. J ago could not be correctly estimated, but the loss of the lives at both places was believed to be not fewer than 350.

It is a continued serrania, running along the whole coast from e. to w. being nine or 10 leagues wide ; and although it is not without some llanos or extensive plains, these are but little known, and are entirely impassable, owing to the swamps and lakes caused by the inundations of the rivers which flow down from the sierra. The sierra, in that part which looks to the n. is barren, and in the vicinities of the coast the •oil is impregnated with nitre, and is unfruitful. The temperature is healthy but cold, especially at night. The most common productions of this province are maize, which serves as bread, supplying the want of wheat, yuca root, of which another kind of bread is made, cazabe, plantains, and other fruits and pulse peculiar to America; also cacao, although with great scarcity, and only in the n. part ; and sugarcanes, which are only cultivated in a sufficient degree to supply the sugar consumed here. It has some cattle ; and although there are means of breeding and feeding many herds, the native* choose rather to supply themselves from  the neighbouring province of Barcelona, notwithstanding the difficulty of bringing them hither over such rugged and almost impassable roads. The whole of the coast yields an immense abundance ^&gt;f fish, also of shell fish of various kinds, and of the most delicate flavour. Of these the consumption is very great, and a great proportion of them are salted, and carried to the inland parts ; and to the province of Venezuela alono upwards of 3000 quintals yearly. It has several convenient and secure ports and bays, and indeed the whole coast is covered with them, as the sea is here remarkably calm, and peculiarly so in the celebrated gulf of Cariaco, as also in the gulfs of the lake of Obispo, J uanantar, and Gurintar. It has many very abundant saline grounds, so much so, that the whole coast may be looked upon as forming one ; since in any part of it as many might be established as were necessary ; and this without mentioning that celebrated one of Araya, and those of the gulf Triste, between the settlements of Iraca and Soro, and the Sal Negra, (Black Salt), used only by the Indians. In this province there are only three rivers of consideration, that of Cariaco, of Cumana, and of Guarapiche : the others which flow down from the serrania are of little note, and incorporate themselves with the former before they arrive in the valley. Its jurisdiction contains six settlements belonging to the Spaniards, seven belonging to the Indians, 13 to the missions supported by the Aragonese Capuchin fathers, and 16 belonging to the regular clergy. [From the river Unare to the city of Cumana, the soil is very fertile. From the Araya to the distance of between 20 and 25 leagues, more to thee, the coast is dry, sandy, and unfruitful. The soil is an inexhaustible mine both of marine and mineral salt. That which is near the Orinoco is fit only for grazing, and this is the use to which it is put. It is here that all the pens of the province are kept. All the rest of this country is admirably fertile. The prairies, the valleys, the hills, proclaim by their verdure and by the description of the produce, that nature has deposited here the most active principles of vegetable life. The most precious trees, the mahogany, the Brazil and Campechy woods, grow even up to the coast of Paria ; and there are found here many rare and agreeable birds. In the interior of the government of Cumana are mountains, some of which are very high : the highest is the Tumeriquiri, which is 936 fathoms above the surface of the sea. The cavern of Guacharo, so famous among the Indians, is in this mountain. It is immense, and serves asan habitation for thousands of night birds,] 4 b 2    C U M A N A.    [a new species of the caprbnulgas of Linnaeus, the fat of which makes the oil of Guacharo. Its situation is majestic, and ornamented with the most brillant vegetation. A pretty large river issues from the cavern, and in the interior are heard the dismal cries of the birds, which the Indians ascribe to departed souls, which they think are all obliged to enter this cavern, to pass into the other world. The principal colonies belonging to Cumana lie to the w. ; as Barcelona, Piritu, Clarinas, &amp;c. At 12 leagues to s. e. of Cumana is the valley of Cumanacoa, where are tobacco plantations belonging to the king. The soil there is so adapted to this species of produce, that the tobacco ground has obtained a decided preference throughout the country over that which is cultivated in any other part of Tierra Firme. Cigars made of the tobacco of Cumanacoa fetch easily double the price of those made with the tobacco of any other place. In the environs of Cumanacoa, are the Indian villages of San Fernando, Arenas, Aricagua, which are all situated on an extremely fertile soil. Farther in the interior are the valleys of Carepe, Guanaguana, Cocoyar, &amp;c. which are also very fertile, but uncultivated ; but the part which appears most to promise prosperity is the coast of the gulf of Paria, between the most s. mouth of the Orinoco and the mouth of the Guarapiche. The whole territory of the government of Cumana is completely hemmed in by ravines, rivulets, and rivers, equally useful for the purposes of watering the land, working hydraulic machines, and for navigation. The rivers that discharge themselves into the sea to the n. are the Neveri and Mansanares, both possessing little water, and having but short courses. Those that fall into the gulf of Paria to the e„ flow through greater extent of country. Some join the river Guarapiche, which is navigable as far as 25 leagues from the sea; and of these are the Colorado, Guatatar, Caripe, Punceres, Tigre, Guayuta, &amp;c. There are others which run to the s. and after having watered the province, fall into the Orinoco. The produce of the government of Cumana can therefore be shipped, according to convenience, to the n. by Barcelona and Cumana; to the e. by the gulf of Paria, and to the s. by the Orinoco. At an average of four years, from 1799 to 1803, the quantity of cacao exported from this province amounted to 18,000 fanegas. Its population is 80,000 persons, including the missions of the Aragonese Capuchins. The capital is Cumana, Santa Ines de, a city founded by Gonzalo de Ocampo in 1520. It is of a hot and unhealthy temperature, and its territory is dry and  unfruitful. It lies within a cannon's shot of the seashore, in the gulf formed by the sea in the shape of a semicircle, where all kinds of vessels may be built. On its beech is a saline ground, Avhicb, without being regularly worked, supplies sufficient salt both for the use of the city and of (he immediate settlements. It lies in the middle of the llanura, or plain of the river of its name. The same river passes in front of the city, serving as a barrier to it, and so enters the mouth of the gulf. At the back begins the serrania, which for more than eight leagues is sterile and impassable, on account of brambles and thorns. The soil towards the front of the city is composed of pebble, gypsum, and sand, which, during the prevalence of the wind Briza, occasions an excessive heat, fand is very offensive to the eyes ; bad sight being here a very common malady. Nearly in the centre of the town, upon an elevated ground, stands the castle of Santa Maria de la Cabeza, which is of a square figure, and commands the city. In the lofty part of the sierra are seen three round hills ; upon the highest of which stands a castle called San Antonio, and upon the lowest a fort called La Candelaria. There is upon the beach another castle, which is denominated the fort of Santa Catalina i The same is at the mouth of the river, just where a sand bank has of late been formed, so as to block up the entrance of the river, and to render it dangerous for large vessels. The fort is at some distance from the gulf; and as a wood has of late sprung up between this and the shore, it is not possible to see the water from the fort. It has, besides the parish church, which is very poor, twa convents of monks, one of St. Francis, and the other of St. Domingo. These form its population, amounting to 600 souls, who maintain themselves in the poor estates, which are about 50 in number, and produce some sugarcanes, of which are made brandy, and sugar of the colour of a yellow wax used in the country : some fruits and i/ucas, maize and cacao, are also grown here, but in such small quantities that a crop never yields upwards of 100 bushels. These estates are, for the most part, at some distance from the city, and the greater number of them are inhabited by their masters, the poorer inhabitants alone dwelling in the city. At a small distance from it, is an hermitage dedicated to Nuestra Seiiora del Carmen.

The seat of the government of the two provinces is at the city of Cumana. The governor, nominated for five years, is also vicepatron, and in this capacity nominates to all vacant cures, and fills all the church offices, the appointment to which forms a part of the prerogative of the crown. He has the administration of the finances of his department, as deputy of the intendants ; and in this capacity he superintends the levying of the taxes, decides disputes, directs the ordinary expences, and receives the accounts of the offices of administration ; but the political relations with foreign colonies, and all military matters, depend on the captaingeneral of Caracas. The governor is also under the orders of the intendant in his fiscal regulations and commercial measures. To the k. of the city of Cumana lies the gulf of Cariaco. The river Mansanares, which separates on the s. the city from the suburbs inhabited by the Guayqueris Indians, surrounds the s. and the w. sides of the town. This is the only water that the inhabitants of Cumana drink. It has the inconvenience of often being not limpid, though rarely unwholesome. The city enjoys a healthy, but scarcely ever a fresh air ; the heat is continual. The seabreeze is nevertheless very regular, and moderates, during a great part of the day, the blaze of the sun. The only defence that_, Cumana has is a fort, situated on an elevation ranging along the back of the city. The city itself has but a garrison of 231 troops of the line, and a company of artillery. The militia increases the public force in time of war. The total number of inhabitants is 24,000. The city is now four times as large as it was fifty years ago. It increases with so much rapidity that the ancient boundaries not affording convenient space for new houses, people have been obliged, within this short time, to build upon the left bank of the Mansanares, to the w. of the village of the Guayqueris. These new houses are already so numerous as to form a village communicating with the city by a bridge ; and the inhabitants, for their convenience, had built, in 1803, a church. The first street that was formed was named Emparan, in honour of the governor of this name. All the houses of Cumana are low, and rather solidly built. The frequent earthquakes  experienced here since these ten years, have obliged them to sacrifice beauty and elegance to personal safety. The violent shocks felt -in December 1797, threw down almost all the stone buildings, and rendered uninhabitable those that were left standing. The earthquake experienced here in November 1799, caused a variation of the needle of 45 minutes. According to M. de Humboldt, Cumana is exposed to these earthquakes in consequence of its proximity to the lake of Cariaco, which appears to have some communication with the volcanoes of Cumucuta, which vomit hydrogen gas, sulphur, and hot bituminous water. It is observed that the earthquakes happen only after the rains, and then the caverns of the Cuchivano vomit during night inflammable gas, which is seen to blaze 200 yards high. It is probable that the decomposition of the water in the slate marl, which is full of pyrites, and contains hydrogenous particles, is one of the principal causes of this phenomenon. The population of Cumana, amounting to 80,000 souls, is a great part composed of white Creoles, amongst whom much natural capacity is discovered. They are very much attached to their native soil, and generally give themselves up entirely to the occupation that birth or fortune has assigned them. Some are employed in agriculture, commerce, and navigation, and others in fishing. The abundance of fish found about Cumana enables them to salt an astonishing quantity, which they send to Caracas and the other cities of these provinces, as well as to the Windward islands, from whence they import in return iron tools for husbandry, provisions, and contraband merchandise. The cargoes are always of little value. They are satisfied with small profits, which they augment by the frequency of the voyages. Capitals of 4 or 5000 dollars, which in other places would appear insufficient for any commercial enterprise, support five or six families at Cumana. Activity and perseverance form almost the only source of the comfort that reigns here. The Creoles of Cumana who engage in literary pursuits are distinguished by their penetration, judgment, and application. They have not exactly the vivacity observable in the Creoles of Maracaibo, but they compensate for this by superior good sense and solidity of parts. The retail trades of Cumana are carried on by Catalonians and people from the Canaries. Among the productions in which this city trades, the cacao and cacaooil deserve to be mentioned. Medicinal plants, might also form an important article of commerce,, were not the inhabitants ignorant of their qualities, and the manner of preparing them.. There is-  CUM  found in the environs of Cumana what the Spaniards call tuspa, a species of the Jesuits' bark ; the calaguala, a plant, the root of which is dissolvent, aperitive, and sudorific 4 the pissipint, a species of emetic ; ihecaranapire, a species of sage ; and the tualua, a more powerful purgative than jalap.

Cumana, a river of the above province and government, which rises in the spot called Cocoyan, in the serrania. It runs n. following this course continually through the sierra until it flows down to the plain near the city, from whence it enters the gulf, first having divided itself into four arms. In the winter time it generally overflows ; but as the distance from the sierra to its mouth, or where it enters the sea, is so short, it quickly subsides within its proper bed, when it leaves water enough for the navigation of a barge ; and there would be sufficient for large vessels, were it not for the bar which is at its mouth and impedes its entrance. In the summer time, however, it becomes so dry, that it is scarcely navigable for canoes. 

==[[Gumanacoa|GUMANACOA]]==, a city lying *. e. of Cumana 14 leagues; in the middle of the valley of the same name. The population amounts to 4200 people ; the air is wholesome, the waters havea diureticquality not commonly to be met with. This city wants nothing but hands to avail itself of the productions which the richness of the land would yield, if it were cultivated. The fruits have here an uncommonly fine savour, taste, and substance. The government gives this city the name of San Baltasar de los Arias, but that of Cumanacoa has so much prevailed, that it is the only one by which it ii now known. See Cumana. CUM 
==[[Cumanagota|CUMANAGOTA]]==, a city of the former province and government, in the kingdom of Tierra Firme, called also San Baltasar de los Arias. It has a good, convenient, and secure port ; is situate on the skirts of the most elevated part of the serrania, in a fertile valley, which abounds in streams, which irrigate 26 estates of yucales, some small plantations of cacao, and some cattle. The productions of all these estates are consumed in the country ; since, through the unevenness of the roads, it is impossible to carry them out of it, with the exception, however, of tobacco, with which Cumana is supplied. The soil is the most fertile of any in the province, especially to the n. of the sierra, where there might be established some very good cacao estates ; but this is not to be accomplished, considering the scarcity of its inhabitants, and their great poverty. This city, just after the conquest of these countries, was noted for its famous pearlfisheries, which were afterwards abandoned. Its vicinity was inhabited by many gentile Indians, who were at continual enmity with the Spaniards and the other inhabitants ; but these troublesome people were reduced to obedience by Don Juan de Urpin, who had held consultations for that purpose with the council of the Indies. The population amounts to 800 souls, including the Negro slaves and the people of colour.

[==[[Cupica|CUPICA]]==, a bay or small port to the s. e. of Panama, following the coast of the Pacific ocean, from cape S. Miguel to cape Corientes. The name of this bay has acquired celebrity in the kingdom of New Granada, on account of a new plan of communication between the two seas. From Cupica we cross, for five or six marine leagues, a soil quite level and proper for a canal, which would terminate at the Embarcadero of the Rio Naipi ; this last river is navigable, and flows below the village of Zatara into the great Rio Atrato, which "itself enters the Atlantic sea. A very intelligent Biscayan pilot, M. Gogueneche, was the first who had the merit of turning the attention of government to the bay of Cupica, which ought to be for the neAv continent what Suez was formerly for Asia. M. Gogueneche proposed to transport the cacao of Guayaquil by the 4 t  .  
: I  CUQ  
Rio Naipi to Cartagena. The same way offers the advantage of a very quick communication between Cadiz and Lima. Instead of dispatching couriers by Cartagena, Santa Fe, and Quito, or by Buenos Ayres and Mendoza, good quicksailing packetboats might be sent from Cupica to Peru. If this plan Avere carried into execution, the viceroy of Lima would have no longer to wait five or six months for the orders of his court. Besides, the environs of the bay of Cupica abounds with excellent timber fit to be carried to Lima. We might almost say that the ground between Cupica and the mouth of the Atrato is the only part of all America in which the chain of the Andes is entirely broken.]

[==[[Cura|CURA]]==, with the surname of St. Louis de, is situate in a valley formed by mountains of a very grotesque appearance ; those on the s. w. side are capped with rocks. The valley is, however, fertile, and covered with produce, but the greater part of the property consists in animals." The temperature is warm and dry ; the soil is a reddish clay, which is extremely muddy in the rainy seasons ; the water is not limpid, although it is wholesome. The inhabitants are 4000, governed by a cabildo. In the church is an imageof our Lady of Vakncianos, the claim to which was long a subject of dispute between the curate of Cura and that of Sebastian de los Reynos ; and after a 30 years contest, it was ordered by the bishop Don Francisco de Ibarro tq be returned to this place, when it was received in a most triumphant manner. This city is in lat. 10° 2' ; twentytwo leagues *. a&gt;. of Caracas, and eight leagues s. e. of the lake of Valencia.] 
CURAB1CO, a river of the province and captainship of Maranan in Brazil. 

==[[Curacoa|CURACOA|Curazao]]==, an island of the N. sea, one of the Smaller Antilles; situate near the coast of the province and government of Venezuela. It is 30 miles long, and 10 broad, and is the only island of any consideration possessed by the Dutch in America. It was settled in 1527, by the Emperor Charles V. as a property upon the house of Juan de Ampues; is fertile, and abounds in sugar and tobacco, large and small cattle, also in very good saline grounds, by which the other islands are provided : but its principal commerce is in a contraband trade carried on with the coasts of Tierra Firme ; on which account its storehouses are filled with articles of every description imaginable. Formerly its ports were seldom without vessels of Cartagena and Portobelo, which were employed n the Negro trade, bringing home annually from 1000 to 15,000 Negroes, with various other articles of merchandise, although this branch of commerce has, from the time that it was taken up by the English, greatly declined. On the s. part of  Hi Kb  

CUR AGO A.  fhe island, and at the w. extremity, is a good port, called Santa Barbara ; but the best port is near three leagues to the 5. e. of the n. part. The Dutch send annually from Europe many vessels richly laden, and carrying merchandise much in request in every part of America, and this is the principal cause of the flourishing state of this colony. 
[The Dutch took this island from the Spaniards in 1632; it was captured by the English in 1798, and again in 1806, when the conduct of Captain Brisbane, who had only three frigates under his command, afforded one of the most wonderful exploits of the British navy. The island, notwithstanding what Alcedo remarks, is not only barren and dependent on the rains for its water, but the harbour is naturally one of the worst in America ; yet the Dutch have entirely remedied that defect, they have built upon this harbour one of the largest, and by far the most elegant and cleanly towns in the W. Indies. The Dutch ships from Europe used to touch at this island for intelligence or pilots, and then proceed to the Spanish coasts for trade, which they forced with a strong hand, it having been very difficult forthe Spanish guurdacostas to take these vessels ; for they were not only stout ships, with a number of guns, but were manned with large crews of chosen seamen, deeply interested in the safety of the vessel and the success of the voyage ; they had each a share in the cargo, of a value proportioned to the station of the owner, supplied by the merchants upon credit, and at a prime cost \ this animated them with an uncommon courage, and they fought bravely, because every man fought in defence of his own property. Besides this, there was, and still is, a constant intercourse between this island and the Spanish continent. Curacoa has numerous warehouses, al-  ways full of the commodities of Europe and the East Indies. Here are all sorts of woollen and linen cloth, laces, silks, ribbands, iron utensils,* naval and military stores, brandy, the spices, of the Moluccas, and the calicoes of India, white and painted. Hither the Dutch West India, which was also their African company, annually brought three or four cargoes of slaves, and to this mart the Spaniards themselves yet come in small vessels, and carry oft', at a very high price, great quantities of all the above sorts of goods ; and the seller has this advantage, that the refuse of warehouses and mercers shops, and every thing that is grown unfashionable and unsaleable in Europe, go off here extremely well; every thing being sufficiently recommended by its being European. The Spaniards pay in gold or silver, coined or in bars, cacao, vanilla, Jesuits bark, cochineal, and other valuable commodities. The trade of Curacoa, even in times of peace, was said to be annually worth no less than 500,00O£. ; but in time of war the profit was still greater, for then it becomes the common emporium of the W. Indies ; it affords a retreat to ships of all nations, and at the same time refuses none of them arms and amunition to destroy one another. The intercourse with Spain being then interrupted, the Spanish colonies have scarcely any other market from whence they can be well supplied either with slaves or goods. The French come hither to buy the beef, pork, corn, flour, and lumber, which are brought from the continent of N. America, or exported from Ireland ; so that, whether in peace or in war, the trade of this island flourishes extremely. 
The official value of the Imports and Exports of Curacoa were, in

The trade between Curacoa and St. Domingo has already greatly fallen off; first, by means of supplies from other parts, especially from Dunkirk, but principally from the commotions in that devoted island : little cultivation is carried on here ; but as a naval station, Cura§oa is preeminently important. Its secure and excellent harbour is capable of containing and protecting against all  winds, as well as against any hostile force, upwards of 300 ships of the largest size. All repairs can be conveniently made. In the time of war, it may serve as a rendezvous for merchant vessels bound to Europe, who can always t^ke refuge here, on account of its situation to windward. A fleet defeated at sea may find a safe asylum, and conveniences for refitting ; it is an excellent staj 4 c 2  [tion for privateers, and in the war of 1780 the cruisers from Curacoa greatly annoyed the English W. India trade; so that there was a balance accounted for by the treasury of 190,000 francs, (about 17,275/.), arising from the duties on the prizecargoes. This had been invested on mortgage for the benefit of the company. The governor should be a milifary man ; the mixed nature of the inhabitants renders a strict and more arbitrary form of government necessary here than in the other colonies. Excepting a few merchants, there are scarcely any white inhabitants at the chief town, Williamstad, or on the opposite side of the harbour; such as have any lands live upon them, and the public officers and servants of the company reside in or near the fort. The town's people are a mixture of Jews, Spaniards, sailors, free Mulattoes, free Negroes, Musquito and other Indians. The licentiousness of the Negro slaves is very great here, and attributable to various causes; they are nevertheless worse off than in other colonies, as, in case of a scarcity of provisions, the distress falls chiefly on them. The manumission of slaves, as practised here, is very preposterous ; for it is generally when they are too old to work, that their proprietors pay a small fine to government to emancipate them, and then they must either acquire a precarious subsistence by begging, or are exposed to perish by want, as there is no provission for such objects. There are still at Bonaire a few remaining of the original inhabitants, and three or four aged people at Curacoa ; with these exceptious the natives have become extinct. There are hardly half a dozen families of whites who have not intermarried with Indians or Negroes on the intermediate coasts. At Williamstad there is a Dutch reformed church, a Lutheran church, a Roman Catholic chapel, and a Jewish synagogue ; houses are built so near the walls of the fort, that a ladder from the upper stories would be sufficient to get within the 1 walls. A remarkable blunder of the engineer is noticed, who, in building a stone battery, turned the embrasures inwards instead of outwards. In the front of that battery of the fort which is intended to command the entrance of the harbour, a range of warehouses has been built, which are not only themselves exposed to the fire of an enemy, but impede the use of the guns of the fort, which would first have to level those warehouses to a certain height before their shot could reach a hostile force. The powder magazine was placed at a distance from the fort, and in such a situation as to expose the road or access to it, to the fire of any ship coming round on that side. The  

CURACOA. i town, harbour, and fort, are however capable of being made impregnable by any force attacking them from the seaside; yet they would be greatly exposed on the landside, and there are several places on the shores of the island where an enterprising enemy might find means to effect a landing with small craft ; these spots ought, therefore,  likewise to be fortified, and a garrison ought to be  maintained, numerous enough to dispute the ground foot by foot, which, in such a rocky island, abounding with difficult passages and defiles through the broken rocks, could easily be done ; and an enemy, however strong at their landing, if they should effect it, would be exhausted by a well contested retreat, before they could reach the chief settlement. Curacoa is in lat. 12° 6'. Long. 09° 2'.] 
Curacoa. This beautiful city is well situated ; its buildings are large, convenient, and magnificent ; is full of storehouses and shops well provided with every species of merchandise, and of all kinds of manufactories ; so that you may see at one glance a vessel building, the sails and rigging, and all its other necessary equipments preparing, and even the articles being macufactured with which it is to be laden. It has a good port, in which vessels from all parts are continually lying ; its entrance is defended by a castle, but dangerous and difficult to be made, and to effect it, it is necessary to make fast a cable to the same castle, although a vessel, when once in, will lie very safe. It has a synagogue for the convenience of the many Jews who inhabit the city, and who are the principal merchants. The French, commanded by M. Caissar, bombarded it in 1714 ; but the commanding ship of his squadron was wrecked upon the coast.

It is of a benign and healthy climate ; and although in the summer, the heat on the llanuras is rather oppressive, extremely fertile, and abounding, independently of the fruits peculiar to the country, in wheat, all kinds of pulse, wine, and brandies, which were formerly carried to the provinces of Tucuman aud Buenos Ayres, although this traffic has of late fallen into decay, from the frequent arrivals of vessels from Spain. It abounds in all kinds of cattle, and in the cordiUera, and even ia the pampas, are large breeds of vicunas, huanacos, vizcachas, turtles, two kinds of squirrels, ostriches, tigers, leopards, and an infinite quantity of partridges, pigeons, and turtledoves. The flesh of the swine and mules is esteemed the best in all America; and, generally speaking, victuals areso cheap that it may be procured at little or no expence. The skirts of the mountains are covered with beautiful woods, and their tops are overspread with snow. Throughout nearly the whole province is found a great quantity of glasswort, and in the cordiUera are some mines of silver, especially in the valley of Iluspallata, which were formerly worked by fusion, to the great detriment of the metal, but which are to this day worked in the same manner as those of Peru, and consequently afford greater emolument. Here are also some gold mines, and others of very good copper. The rivers which water this province all rise in the cordiUera, and the most considerable of them are the Tunuyan, which is the first to the s. those of Mendoza, San Juan, Jachal, and the Colorado to the n. e. In the cordiUera, near the high road leading from Santiago to Mendoza, is the great lake of the Inca, wherein are said to be great treasures deposited by the Incas at the beginning of the conquest, to keep them from the Spaniards. This lake is bottomless, and it is thought to be formed of the snows melted and flowing down from the mountainous parts of the district. On the side towards Chile the lake has a vent by six or seven small branches, forming the river of Aconcagua ; and from the opposite side issue some other streams in a contrary direction, and form the Mendoza. In the very heat of summer this in  ^-  C V Y  lake is as cold as snow itself, This province, like all the others of the kingdom which lie to the s. e. of the cordilfcra, is ever subject to terrible tempests of thunder and lightning, accompanied with boisterous winds and rains from October to March; the same not happening in the provinces which lie to the to. The Indians of this province are of a darker complexion than those of any other ; but they are also of loftier stature, better made, agile, and extremely addicted to the chase, in which they greatly excel, and more particularly in the taking of ostriches, which abound in the llanuras to \X\cs. ; and by all of these exercises they become so light and active as to be able to keep pace with a horse. These Indians are generally known here by the name of Guapes, and are descendants of the Pampas, their neighbours to the e. with whom they trade in the fruits of the country in exchange for clothes and other articles, money not being known amongst any of these barbarians. The Guapes are of a docile and generous disposition, but of great spirit, and very warlike, robust, and well formed. This country, considering its extent, is but thinly peopled, since its inhabitants amount to only 25,000 of all sexes and ages, according to the latest calculation. The capital is the city of Mendoza. [See Chile.] _ _ Cxjyo, a shoal formed by two rocks in the N. sea, near the coast of the province and government of Yucatan, close to the cape of Cotoche.

CU YUM, or C try uni, a large river of the province of Guayana, and government of Cumana. Its origin is not known for certain ; but, from the accounts of the Caribes Indians, it is somewhere near the lake Parime, in the interior of the province, and to the n. e. of the said lake. It runs nearly due from n. to s. making several turnings, until it enters the Esquivo. By this river the Dutch merchants of this colony, assisted by the Caribes, go to entrap the Indians, to make them labour in the estates ; and they have built two forts on either side of the mouth of this river.

==[[Cuzamala|CUZAMALA]]==, a head settlement of the district of the alcaldia mayor of Azuchitlan in Nueva Espana, lying 10 leagues to the n. of its capital, and being divided from the same by two large rivers. It is of a hot and dry temperature ; its population is composed of 36 families of Spaniards, 30 of Mustees, 48 of Mulattoes, and 53 of Indians, who speak the Taracan language. The trade here consists in large cattle, in the cultivation of maize, and making cascalote. Some emolument also is derived from renting the lands belonging to the capital and the neighbouring settlements. 
==[[Cuzcatlan|CUZCATLAN]]==, a settlement of the province and alcaldia mayor of San Salvador in the kingdom of Guatemala. 
==[[Cuzco|CUZCO|Cozco]]==, as it is called by the Indians, a city, the capital of a corregimiento in Peru, the head of a bishopric, erected in 1536, founded by the first Emperor of the Incas, Manco Capac, in 1043, who divided it into Hanam Cozco and Hurin Cozco, which signify Cuzco Lofty and Low, or Superior and Inferior ; the former towards the n. and the second towards the s. It is situate upon a rough and unequal plain formed by the skirts of various mountains, which are washed by    c u z c o.  the small river Guatanay ; the same being nearly dry, save in trie months of January, February, and March ; though the little water found in it just serves to irrigate the neighbouring plains. The grandeur and magnificence of the edifices, of the fortress, and of the temple of the sun, struck the Spaniards with astonishment, when, at the conquest, they first beheld them, and upon their entering the city, in 1534, when the same was taken possession of by Don Francisco Pizarrro, for Charles V. It was then the capital of the whole empire of Peru, and the residence of the emperors. Its streets were large, wide, and straight ; though at the present day Lima stands in competition with it in regard to grandeur. The houses are almost all built of stone, and of fine proportions. The cathedral, which has the title of La Asuncion, is large, beautiful, rich, and of very good architecture, and some even prefer it to the cathedral of Lima. Here are three curacies in the chapel of the Sagrario, two for the Spaniards, and another for the Indians and Negroes ; and the parishes are Nuestra Seiiora de Belen, San Christoval, Santa Ana, San Bias, Santiago, and the hos-  Rodrigo de Leon, in Seville ; and it was by this means that the hospital, having become so well endowed, has now no less than 250 beds. A jubilee has been granted by the apostolical see to its chapel ; and this is celebrated at the octave of Pentecost with much solemnity, and by an unusually great concourse of people, and was once the best observed jubilee of any iu America. The second hospital, being of the religious order of San Juan de Dios, is for the men, and has 50 beds ; the third, called, Of Nuestra Seiiora de la Almudena, is for all descriptions of individuals, and has also 50 beds ; the fourth, called San Andres, has 30 beds for Spanish women. Here are three monasteries of nuns ; the first of Santa Catalina de Sena, founded where the Incas kept the virgins dedicated to the sun ; and the others are of Santa Clara and the barefooted Carmelites. Here are also four other religious houses, which are that of the Nazarenes, thatoi' Nuestra Senora del Carmen^ that of Santiago, and that of San Bias; three colleges, which are, that of San Bernardo, wherein are taught grammar, philosophy, and theology, and was founded by a Vizcayau for the sons of the  pital ; besides two others, which are without the conquerors, having been formerly under the charge of the regulars of the company of Jesuits, and at present under an ecclesiastical rector ; that of San Borja, for the sons of the Indian caciques, where they are initiated in their letters, and in the rudiments of music, at least as many of them as show any disposition to this science, (this accomplishment having been formerly taught by the same regulars of the company); and that of San Antonio Abad, which is a seminary and university, and is a very sumptuous piece of architecture. This city preserves many monuments of its ancient grandeur ; and amongst the rest, the great fortress built for its defence, which, although injured by time, bears testimony to the powers of the lncas, and excites astonishment in the mind of every beholder, since the stones, so vast and shapeless, and of so irregular a superficies, are knit together, and laid one to fit into the other with such nicety as to want no mortar or other material whereby to fill up the interstices ; and it is indeed difficult to imagine how they could work them iu this manner, when it is considered that they knew not the use of iron, steel, or machinery for the purpose. The other notable things are the baths; the one of warm and the other of cold water ; the ruins of a large stoneway, which was built by order of the lncas, and which reached as far as where Lima now stands ; the vestiges of some subterraneous passages which led to the fortress from the housesjor palacesof the Inca, and in which pa&amp;.  city, called San Geronimo and San Sebastian Here are nine convents of the following religious orders; one of St. Dominic, founded on the spot where the Indians had their celebrated temple of the sun ; two of St. Francis, one of the Observers, and another of the Recoletans, one of St. Augustin, one of La Merced, two colleges which belonged to the regulars of the extinguished company of Jesuits, the principal, in the part lying towards the e. being destined, at the present time, for an armoury ; and the other at the back of the same, in which was the house for noviciates and students, serving now as barracks for the troops ; add to these the chapel of ease to the cathedral. Here are four hospitals ; the first and most ancient is that of the Espiritu Santo, in which are received Indians of both sexes, subject to the patronage of the secular cabildo,, and governed by a junta of 33 persons, the president of whom, the alcalde, has the first vote, and after him the administrator or first brother. It has two chaplains and very ample revenues ; one of the sources being the duties paid upon all effects passing over the bridge of Apurimac, the which droits belonged to the royal exchequer until the year 1763, at which time, at the instance of the king's ensign, Don Gabriel de IJgarte, they were conceded by the king to the hospital, together with the right and property of the bridge, in redemption of some crown grants which were left to the hospital by  cuzco.  
/  sages the walls were cut rery crooked, admitting for a certain space only one person to pass at a time, and this side wise, and with great difficulty, when shortly afterwards two might pass abreast. The exit was by a rock, worked in the same narrow manner on the other side ; and this was altogether a plan adopted through prudence, and for the better security against' any sudden assault, since here a single man might defend himself against a great number. In a magnificent chapel of the cathedral is venerated a miraculous crucifix, which was presented by the Emperor Charles V". and which is cailed De los Temblores, from the city having invoked it as a patron in the tremendous earthquake which happened here in 1590; also an image of Nuestra Senora de Belen, which they call La Linda, (the Beautiful), the gift of the same royal hand. It is the second city of Peru, and inferior only to the capital of the kingdom. It was governed, after the time of the conquests made by the Spaniards, by a secular cahildo, composed of two ordinary alcaldes, a royal ensign, an alguaxil mayor, a provincial alcalde, a depositorgeneral, 12 perpetual regidors, two alcaldes of the inquisition, and a regidor, nominated annually, with the title of judge of the natives, who is entrusted with the causes of the Indians ; these having also a protector, nominated every two years by the viceroy of Lima. This cahildo maintains, through the grant, of the Emperor Charles V\ the same privileges as the cahildo of Burgos. The city has also many other prerogatives, with the title of Gran Ciudad, and Cabeza, or head of the kingdoms and provinces of Peru, in reward for its having supported the crown against the traitor Diego de Almagro, in the conflicts that he maintained with Francis Pizarro, and from its having taken him prisoner in 1553, in the celebrated battle of Las Salinas, a league from Cuzco; also from its having refused to acknowledge the title of governor of Peru, assumed by Diesro de Almagro the younger, supporting, in preference, the legitimate government. Again, when the Licentiate Christoval Vaca de Castro arrived, thinking to be governor, the people of Cuzco took him prisoner, under the orders of the lieutenantgovernor, Diego Salazar de Toledo, and the ordinary alcalde, Antonio Ruiz de Guevera, and kept him -in confinement until he was beheaded in that place by the same person that executed his father. For these services, and for the valuable presents, which on several occasions it has made to the crown, this city was allowed to be by the laws of the Indies, and, as appears by its records, one of the first cities in all Castilla, haying a priority of  vote; and in 1783, it was ordered by the kinr of Spain, that in consideration of the resistance it offered m the late rebellion of the Indians of the province of Tinta and the other immediate provinces, it should be endowed with the title of Most Noble, Most Loyal, and Most Faithful, and that it should enjoy the same privileges as Lima. In 1784, the office of corregidor was extinguished and his Majesty established an intendant'^and governor vicepatron; and in 1787, the tribunaUf royal audience, composed of a president, four oidors, and a fiscal. It has for arms a golden castle upon a blue field, with various trophies and colours on the sides, and an eagle at the top It has been the native place of many illustrious men and of these are,

Its jurisdiction, although it may retain the title of province, is so reduced as to extend merely as far as the district of the city, notwithstanding it formerly comprehended all the neighbouring provinces, until the president, Lope Garcia de Castro, established in each of these separate correoidors. Its principal commerce consists in the very lar"-e quantity of sugar which is made in the neighbouring jurisdictions, and where the inhabitants have many sugar plantations; that of San Ignacio de Pachachaca, in the boundaries of the jurisdiction of Abancay, and formerly belonging to the regulars of the extinguished company of Jesuits, being the most celebrated. There is made here a vast quantity of baize and ordinary cloth, called panete, woven stuffs, saddles, floorcarpets, and tucuyo, which is an ordinary kind of linen used as clothing by the poor ; galloons of gold, silver,*3  cuzco,  and silk, dressed sheepskins, goalskins, and parchment. The natives, who are of an ingenious disposition, excel in the arts of embroidery,painting, and engraving. Here was formerly a mint, which for some years has been abolished. The population, which amounts to 26,000 souls, has become much diminished by a plague experienced here in 1720.
