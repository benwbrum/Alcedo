PACIFIC Sea, a name improperly given to the S. sea, as every one will maintain who has navigated it : for, although the part between the tropics may justify the name, the rest of it does not merit such a title, as being subject to violent tempests, in lat. 20° and 23°, equally strong as any in Europe. The first Spaniards who navigated this sea gave it the name of Pacific for the serenity and gentle gales which they experienced in their first voyages, persuading themselves that it was equally calm all over it ; but the fury   5 of the tempests in the winter, and the dreadful agitation of its waters, declare it well worthy of another name. 
The pilots of this sea have constantly observed that when a n. wind is about to blow, there will appear one or two days previous to hover round the ships a marine bird, which they czllquebrantahuesos (breakbones), and which is seen on no other occasion ; neither do they know to where it resorts.

[This once powerful Indian nation (of which our author speaks) has, apparently, entirely disappeared; every inquiry made after them has proved ineffectual. In the year 1724, they resided in several villages on the heads of the Kansas river, and could, at that time, bring upwards of 2000 men into the field. (See Mons. Dupratz History of Louisiana, page 71, and the map attached to that  work). The information that we have received is, that being oppressed by the nations residing on the Missouri, they removed to the upper part of the river Plate, where they afterwards had but little intercourse with the whites. They seem to have given name to the n. branch of that river, which is called the Paducas Fork. The most probable conjecture is, that being still further reduced, they have divided into small wandering bands, which assumed the names of the subdivisions of the Paducas nation, and are known to us at present under the appellation of Wetepahatoes, Kiawas, Kanenavisn, Katteka, Dotame, &c. who still inhabit the country to which the Paducas are said to have removed.]

It is the place where passengers disembark to go by land to Lima, and the other provinces of Peru, and where ships bound to Callao touch to take m provisions, &c. ; since, without this precaution, it would be almost impossible to make that voyage, so tedious by the usually contrary winds. The town is situate on a sandy, soil, which produces neither a sprout of herbage, or drop of. fresh water.. This is, therefore, brought front,  P A I  :: :  the settlement of Colan, and though of a whitish and unpleasant look, is, nevertheless, accounted wholesome, and supposed to be impregnated with the medicinal virtues of sarsaparilla, through a wood of which trees it passes. They bring it in balzas or rafts, on which they also carry maize and other productions to the ships ; but they have no other cattle than goats, though plenty of fish, and particularly the seacats, which they catch in abundance, and carry for sale to the other provinces, when dried, and where they are used in the same manner as dried codfish. The houses are low, and the walls of earth and cane, with the exception of the house of the corregidor, the parish church, and a convent of the order of La Merced, which are all of stone ; but the slight structure of their buildings is only adapted to this climate, where it is something wonderful to rain ; and thus, when a considerable shower fell in 1728, the greater part of the houses were quite demolished.

The exterior one, which was in general about two toises wide and as many deep, is in some parts so wide as to be seen at a league's distance ; and indeed it was altogether so ordered for the safety of the besieged, that the inner border should command the exterior ones. At the top of this mountain there blows a constant wind, so strong that people can scarcely live in it. It is 20 miles with a slight inclination to the n. of Quito. PAIMAUNKE. See York. [PAMLICO Sound, on the e. coast of N. Carolina, is a kind of lake or inland sea, from 10 to 30 miles broad, and nearly 60 miles in length. It is separated from the Atlantic ocean, in its whole length, by a beach of land hardly a mile wide, generally covered with small trees or bushes. Through this bank are several small inlets by which boats may pass ; but Ocrecok inlet is the only one that will admit vessels of burden into the districts of Edenton and Newbern. This inlet is in lat. 34' 54' n. and opens between Ocrecok island and Core bank. This sound communicates with Core and Albemarle sounds, and receives Pamlico or Tar river, the river Neus, besides other small streams. See Ocrecok, Cape Hatteras, &c]

==[[Pampas|PAMPAS]]==, a barbarous nation of warlike Indians of the kingdom of Peru ; extending n. and w. of the Paraguay, and bounded by Cordoba del Tucuman. Pampas, some extensive llanuras of the province and government of Buenos Ayres, running s. formore than 300 leagues, as far as the province ofCuyoof the kingdom of Chile. In them there lives some wandering barbarous nations of Indians, the Huarcas or Pampas, the Aucaes, Pehuenches, Pulches and Uncas ; who for the most part go about on horseback, robbing, plundering, and murdering the travellers which fall into their way : accordingly it is necessary, in passing from Peru to Chile, and viceversa, that the carts (these being the vehicles used for the purpose) should go in large parties, so as to give a more effectual resistance to this race of banditti : nor is the same precaution unobserved by such as go to collect salt from the great saline grounds 200 leagues from Buenos Ayres ; this salt being extremely white, and of excellent quality, and employing, in conveying it, no less than 300 carts, which, although in close company, are not unfrequently attacked in their journey. They start about November, and are two months away on their rout. 
In these vast plains are found many tigers, leopards, ostriches, quiriquinchos or armadillos, partridges, hares, and other animals. In the pastures which are exceedingly fine, and in some parts so lofty as to cover a man on horseback, breed a great number of bulls, horses, and mules, descendants of those brought from Spain at the time of the conquest. Many troops of these wild animals, in their rout from one place to an-  other, will often meet and attack the unwary traveller, and even the aforesaid carts in their way from Buenos Ayres to Mendoza in the kingdom of Chile. Sometimes proceeding in multitudes to drink at one of the many rivers which irrigate these parts, they will rush with such violence into the water that the foremost will be driven so deep into the mud by the pressure of those behind, as to be unable to extricate themselves, and there perish ; and this is the reason why there are constantly seen such heaps of bones on the banks of the abrevaderos or drinking places. 
The Indians have an easy method of catching any of the above animals by a small cord of two yards long, with a ball of iron or stone at one end, at the other a piece of wood or some light substance : this they use as a sling, and such is their dexterity in throwing it that, without ever missing the animal aimed at amongst the vast herd, they cause it so to entwine its legs, that, in effort to escape, it immediately falls, and becomes an easy prey. 
Here are also many asses, by which, in this province as well as that of Tucuman, they produce a fine and numerous breed of mules, which are carried for sale to Peru. There are likewise many dogs, so voracious and bold, that, in lack of cattle to feed on, they will fall upon the people ; nor is it uncommon that, under such circumstances, travellers have been sacrificed to their greediness : these dogs will not merely attack cattle, but they will go in troops and fight the tiger, and although many of them, as is generally the case, will fall victims to their presumption, they never fail to be finally victorious, and glut themselves on its flesh : the same system of warfare they practise, but with less cost, upon the bulls. Those who have seen these engagements represent them as horrible though extremely fine and amusing ; more so, perhaps, could they be witnessed in security. 
In these Pampas blow several strong winds very similar to hurricanes, which they call pamperos ; and so impetuous are they as to arrest the force and progress of the carts drawn by six oxen and with a load of upwards of 600 arrobas. 
Pampas, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Yauyos in Peru, in the district of which is a road leading down to the settlement of Tupe, called de las cinco mil escalones (of the 5000 steps), since it is asserted that there are this number in its descent.

He gave it the name m memory of his native place of Ursua, capital ot Navarra. It is situate on a plain or llano called Del Espiritu Santo, surrounded on all sides by mountains, which make its temperature *xtremely cold. It is very fertile, and abounding in cattle, vegetable productions, sugarengines, and cotton munufactures, with all of which it has a great commerce, as well as by gold and copper taken from some mines, the last of which and the best was discovered in 1765. The parish church is one of the handsomest buildings in the whole kingdom. Here are beautiful houses, public edifices and squares, an hermitage which is a viceparish, and in which is venerated an image of Christ crucified, with two of the thieves, all being fine pieces of sculpture ; some convents of the religious orders of San Francisco, Santo Domingo, San Agustin, a college which belonged to the Jesuits, an hospital, and a monastery of nuns of Santa Clara ; the which, together with the whole city, suffered much from an earthquake which happened in 164.4.

==[[Panama|PANAMA]]==, a city and capital of the kingdom and government of Tierra Firme ; founded on the coast of the Pacific or S. sea, upon an isthmus to which it gives its name, at the foot of a lofty mountain called Ancon. It was founded by Pedrarias Davila in 1518, in a part now called Panama la vieja (the old) where it was sacked and burnt in 1670 by the English pirate John Morgan, when it was in the following year translated to a league's distance by the Majorgeneral Don Antonio Fernandez de Cordoba ; and was first fortified by Alonso Mercado de V^llacorta. It is irregularly and badly defended ; but has been one of the richest and most important towns of commerce in the whole world, as being the regular depot of all the goods going from Peru to Europe, before that the navigation of Buenos Ayres and of Cape Horn were so much practised. It is the head of a bishopric, created in 1521 ; has besides the cathedral, two parishes, one with the title of S. Felipe in the city, and another of the title of Santo Ava, in the suburbs without the wall, which are larger than the city itself; likewise the convents of the orders of San Francisco, S. Domingo, La Merced, the barefooted Augustins with the title of S. Joseph, a college which belonged to the Jesuits, with a seminary for studies, and an university founded by the bishop Don Francisco Xavier de Luna y Victoria in 1571 ; an hospital of San Juan de Dios and a monastery of the nuns of Nuestra Senora de la Concepcion., In its early times it had a mint, which lasted but a short time. It was governed by a president and a tribunal of the royal audience, erected in 1535, which was abolished in 1752, only a military governor and viceroy being left. This city, from being once great and opulent, is reduced to a poor and miserable state from the decay of its commerce since that the galleons have ceased to go to Tierra Firme, and since that it had endured two dreadful conflagrations in 1737 and 1756. To the latter evil it was very liable, most of its houses being built of finely carved wood ; the cathedral, however, is of stone and of magnificent architecture.  The temperature of this city is burning hot, though the nights are fresh and agreeable. The territory is fertile but little cultivated, as the city is supplied with necessaries from the provinces and settlements of its jurisdiction, as well as from those of Peru by the S. sea, and from those of Europe and the foreign colonies by the N. sea, from whence it lies 11 leagues. It is celebrated for the meeting held in it by the Triumvirate, who deliberated in 1525 concerning the discovery and conquest of Peru, who were Franciso Pizarro, Diego de Almagro, and Hernando de Luque. 
The port is formed by some islands at the distance of two leagues and an half from the town, where vessels may lie sheltered from the winds. The tides are regular, and the high water is every three hours, when it runs to a great height, and falls with such rapidity as to leave three quarters of a league dry when down. 
The city of Panama has the arms which were granted it in 1521, by the emperor Charles V. with the title of very noble and very loyal ; a shield divided into a pale and gold field, having in the middle of the right side a yoke and a bundle of browncoloured arrows, with blue points and silver feathers, this having been the device of the catholic kings : then in the other half, or the left side, two carvels, one above the other, and above them a star, which denoted the arctic pole, and in the orle of the shield castles and lions. It is the native place of father Agustin Hurtado, of the Jesuits ; put to death in the settlement of Gayes of the missions of Mainas, at the hands of the Indians, whilst instructing them in the faith in 1688 ; also of father Ignacio de Caceres, his companion.

Panama, or Del Dahien Isthmus, a wide  strip of land uniting N. and S. America, washed on the n. by the N. sea, and on the s. by the Pacific or S. sea, and forming the gulf of Panama. Its width from the mouth of the river Chagre in the N. sea, to that of the river Caimito or Capina in the S. is 41 miles, and at its narrowest part, namely, from the mouth of the river Bayame in the gulf of Panama, to the bay of Mandinga in the N.sea, it is 20 miles only. Its length from e. to w. is more than 200 miles. The cordil/era of the Andes mountains, which are the lowest here, traverses its whole length, and then splits itself into several branches in N. America. This isthmus belongs in part to the province of Tierra Firme, and in part to that of Darien. The climate is nearly throughout hot and moist. It takes its name from the city of Panama, which is situate upon it, on the shore of the S. sea; and in the opposite part, to the n. is Portobello, where there used to be celebrated the large fair of merchandizes on the arrival of the galleons, inasmuch as all the riches that were carried from Peru to the mothercountry were brought by this isthmus, as also the effects returned from Spain to the former; the same being carried by a roundabout journey of 18 leagues, owing to the asperity of the mountains and the immensity of the rivers that obstructed a direct communication. 
In the time of Philip II. it was projected to cut through this isthmus and to unite the two seas ; and accordingly two Flemish engineers were sent to reconnoitre it, but they found insuperable difficulties; and the council of the Indies having represented the mischief which might ensue to the monarchy in case the idea were carried into effect, it was ordained by the Spanish government, that no one should afterwards treat on the subject on pain of death. Eugenio Raynondi calls it Strait San Miguel, but improperly, as there is no communication between the two seas. 
[Of all the subjects, either of political or commercial consideration, relating to the continent of America, none perhaps is of greater moment than this idea of the communication of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. For a diffuse disquisition on this topic, as likewise of the relative facilities for effecting the same object with regard to other parts of America, see Index to new matter respecting Mexico, Chap. X.]

It is fertile in maize and vines, of which there are two gatherings yearly, although commercial regulations have prohibited the making of wine here. Here are, however, many sugar engines for the manufactory of sugar from the abundance of the canes. Its natives, and from whom it takes its name, are the most strong, robust, and valorous of any in the kingdom ; ferocious, of warlike appearance, and cannibals. They are at continual war with the Muzos, and did not marry the womeu of the same settlement, looking upon such as sisters : they adored the sun and moon, and although their number, with regard to other nations, was not large, they were so much feared by all, that the Zipas of Bogota had a garrison of them in the settlements on the boundary of their jurisdiction. Their arms were bows and arrows and wooden clubs. The greater part of them, at the present day, live in the woods and mountains.

==[[Panias|PANIAS]]==, a tribe of Indians of the province and government of Louisiana, where the French have a fort. They live in a settlement, situate on the shore of the river Arkansas. [With these Indians, the idea of the possession of soil is similar to that of the Ottoes. They hunt on the s. side of the river Plate, higher up and on the head of the Kanzas. A great proportion of this country consists of open plains, interspersed however with groves of timber, which are most generally found in the vicinity of the watercourses. It is generally fertile and well watered ; lies level, and free of stone. They have resided in the country which they now inhabit since they were known to the whites. Their trade is a valuable one, from the large proportion of beaver and otter which they furnish ; and it may be expected yet to increase, as those animals are still abundant in their country. The periods of their residence at their village and hunting are similar to the Kanzas and Osages.  Their population is increasing. They are friendly and hospitable to all white persons ; pay great respect and deference to their traders, with whom they are punctual in the payment of their debts. They are, in all respects, a friendly, welldisposed people. They cultivate corn, beans, melons, &c] 

[PANIAS ==[[Loups|LOUPS|Wolves. These Indians are a branch of the Panias Proper]]==, who separated themselves from that nation many years since,and established themselveson a n. branch of the river Plate, to which their name was given. These people have no idea of an exclusive right to any portion of country. They hunt on the Wolf river, above their village, and on the river Plate, above the mouth of that river. This country is very similar to that of the Panias Proper, though there is an extensive body of fertile welltimbered land between the Wolf river, below their village, and the river Corn de Cerf, or Elkhorn river They cultivate corn, beans, &c. The particulars related of the other Panias are also applicable to them. They are seldom visited by any trader, and therefore usually bring their furs and peltry to the village of the Panias Proper, where they traffic with the whites.] [Panias Pique. These Indians have no intercourse with the inhabitants of the Illinois ; the information, therefore, which we have been enabled to obtain, with respect to them, is very imperfect. They were formerly known by the name of the White Panias, and are of the same family with the Panias of the river Plate. They are said to be a welldisposed people, and inhabit a very fertile country ; certain it is that they enjoy a delightful climate.] 
[Panias Republicans, are a branch of Pania Proper, or, as they are frequently termed, the Big Paunch Indians. About ten years since they withdrew themselves from the mothernation, and established a village on a large northwardly branch of the Kanzas, to which they have given name ; they afterwards subdivided and lived in different parts of the country, on the waters of Kanzas river ; but being harassed by their turbulent neighbours, the Kanzas, they have lately rejoined the Panias Proper What has been said with respect to the Panias Proper is applicable to these people, except that they hunt principally on the Republican river, which is better stocked with timber than that hunted by the Panias.] 

==[[Panico|PANICO]]==, a settlement and alcaldia of the Portuguese, in the kingdom of Brazil, between the rivers Corixes and Tocantines, nearer the shore of the former than the second.  ==[[Panico|PANIMA]]==, a settlement of the province and government of Louisiana on the shore of the river Arkansas, with a fort built by the French.

[The Indian tribe mentioned in the two above settlements, are called by the French Panis, and by the Spaniards Towiaches ; the latter is the proper Indian name. They live on the s. side of Red river, by the course of the river, upwards of 800 miles above Natchitoches ; and by land, by the nearest path, it is estimated at about 340. They have, at present, two towns near together ; the lower town, where their chief lives, is called Niteheta, the other is called Towaahach. They call their present chief the Great Bear. They are at war with the Spaniards, but friendly to those French and American hunters who have lately been among them. They are likewise at war with the Osages, as are every other nation. For many hundreds of miles round them the country is rich prairie, covered with luxuriant grass, which is green summer and winter, with skirts of wood on the river bank, by the springs and creeks. 
They have many horses and mules. They raise more corn, pumpkins, beans, and tobacco, than they want for their own consumption ; the

PAN  surplus they exchange with the Hietans for buffalo, rugs, horses, and mules. The pumpkin they cut round in its shreads, and when it is in a state of dryness, that it is so tough it will not break but bend, they plait and work it into large mats, in which state they sell it to/ the Hietans ; who, as they travel, cut off and eat it as they want it. Their tobacco they manufacture and cut as fine as tea, which is put in leather baas of a certain size, and is likewise an article of trade. They have but few guns, and very little ammunition ; what they have they keep for war, and hunt with the bow. Their meat is principally buffalo ; seldom kill a deer, though they are so plentiful as to come into their villages, and about their houses, like a domestic animal. Elks, bears, wolves, antelopes, and wild hogs, are likewise plentiful in their country, and white rabbits, or hares, as well as the common rabbit : white bears sometimes come down amongst them, and wolves of various colours. The men generally go entirely naked, and the women nearly so, only wearing a small flap of a piece of a skin. They have a number of Spaniards among them, of fair complexion, taken from the settlement of Santa Fe, when they were children, who live as they do, and have no knowledge of the place from whence they came. Their language differs from that of any other nation, the Tawakenoes excepted. Their present number of men is estimated at about 400.

200 inhabitants.] 

==[[Panuaya|PANUAYA]]==, a river of the province and corregimiento of Mexico in Nueva Espana, which rises in the mountains of the sierra Nevada, and runs to empty itself in the lake of Chalco. 
==[[Panuco|PANUCO]]==, a province and alcaldia mayor of Nueva Espana ; bounded n. by the Nuevo Reyno de Leon, and by one part of the audience of 
Guadalaxara, e. by the gulf of Mexico, s. by the province of Tlaxcala and that of Mexico, and w. by the kingdom of Mechoacan. The tropic of 
Cancer traverses this province, so that it lies partly in the torrid, partly in the temperate zone; 55 leagues long, and nearly the same wide. 
The part bordering upon the province of Mexico is the best and most fertile, and abounding in provisions, and having some gold mines and  large  square  sandbank, having in the midst several small isles, some of which are called Los Abrojos, and on which many vessels have been lost. This bank is n. of cape Rojo of S. Domingo, and e. of Los Caicos. 

==[[Panun|PANUN]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Chancay in Peru ; annexed to the curacy of Canchas. 
==[[Panzacola|PANZACOLA]]==, a city and garrison of Florida, in the province of its name ; situate in the bay of Santa Maria de Galve : founded by D. Andres de Aveiola, by order of the viceroy of Nueva Espana, the Count de Galve, in 1596. It was formerly small, and is of a moderate temperature, the heat or cold never being excessive at the different seasons. The territory although sandy is fertile, and yields abundantly of whatsoever is sowed. It produces many wild fruits, such as bitter acorns, two kinds of walnuts, the one of which is very delicate, medlars and chesnuts, which have the appearance of nuts, and are of the same taste as the Spanish nuts, and vines which yield large grapes of a purple colour and somewhat sour. 
In the forests are various sorts of wood, pine, several salt earths; but the other part, which sassafras, savines, and oaks; of animals, as deer,  is bounded by Leon, is miserable and barren. This country was one of the first discovered by  cebolos, bears, and also of fowl as large as the turkies of Europe.  In 1719 this city was taken by the French, but restored in the same year by Alfonso Carrascosa de la Torre, who constructed at the point of Sigiienza, one of those which form the entrance of the bay, a fort with the name of Principe de Asturias; but the French, commanded by Count de Chamelin, returned again to attack it with a naval force, against which Don Afonso Carrascosa, with very limited means, in vain made an intrepid defence, and it was eventually burnt and destroyed. In 1762 it was ceded to the English by the peace of Versailles, and in 1781 it was conquered and regained by the Spaniards under Count de Galves. Fortyfive miles e.s.e. of Mobile, in lat. 30 33' n. and long. 78 1 22 w. 

PAO, Concepcion de, a town of the province of Barcelona and government of Cumana : founded in 1744 by some islanders of La Margarita and Trinidad, and other inhabitants of the Caracas who had their cattle and estates in this province ; situate at the source of the river of its name, and in its district its inhabitants, who (of all classes, should amount to 636 souls) have 30 estates, consisting of some narrow glens planted with maize and yucas, also 19 farms of the larger cattle., The soil is the richest and most fertile of the province, and the natives being very laborious, it is extremely well furnished with provisions ; and its population, though small, instrumental to the guarding against invasion from the Caribes Indians in the settlements of the missions of the Orinoco and llanos of San Juan. The geographer, Don Juan de la Cruz, places this city, in his map of S.America, in the province of Venezuela, to the s. of the city of Valencia ; [but this is very erroneous, as it is situated 92 miles s. byw. of Barcelona, 82 n.zo. of St. Tome, and 152 s.e. of Caracas, in lat. 8 43 n. and long. 65" 10 a?.] 
Pao, San Juan Bautista del,, a city of the province and government of Venezuela. Its population is 5400 souls. It has a large trade in horses, mules, and horned cattle, and a vast quantity of cheese is made here. The air is wholesome. The river Pao runs to the e. of the city, its course is n. and s. It discharged itself formerly into the lake of Valencia, but by a revolution of nature it is now made to fall into the Apure, and thus contribute to swell the Orinoco. A canal might easily be cut from about the source of the Pao to join the Orinoco, which would be of vast benefit to commerce, inasmuch as the trade from Venezuela to Guayana would  

PAP  not be liable to the interruption of enemies cruizers, and, in the event of an invasion of the latter province, it might receive early succour, from the former. The city of Pao is in lat. 9 22' n. and long. 68 21' w. and lies 105 miles s, w. of Caracas. 
Pao, a river of the former province and government of Barcelona, and known also by the name of Macuros. It is large and abundant, rises at the back of the serrania, to the s. of the tableland of Guanipa, runs s. e. and collects some streams by the 5. w. Near its source dwell some barbarian Indians of the Ivarecipes and Peritos Indians. It abounds in small fish, and oh its shores grows excellent cacao. The geographer Cruz is also wrong respecting the course of this river, when he gives its source in the province of Venezuela, and makes it enter the Portuguesa; the fact being that it runs into the Orinoco, 48 miles w. of St. Tome, and from whence it is navigable as far as the town of its name. Its mouth is on the n. shore of the Orinoco, in lat. 8° 5' n. 
Pao, another, a small river in this province, which rises in the country and territory of the Pandacotos Indians, between the rivers Paragua and Arvi, runs n. and turning at midcourse to w. enters the latter of those two rivers.

It has for its parochial curate a religious of the order of S. Domingo, who is supported by the synod from the royal treasury of Quito. The inhabitants live by cutting wood and planks on the mountains, and by making of them vaulted roofs, which they call bateas. It is situate at the foot of the cordillera of the Andes, on the n. shore of the river of its name, and in the road leading from Quito to Archidona, in lat. 22' 19' s. Papallacta, the aforesaid river, flows down from the mountain of Pambamarca, and enters the Maranon.

[==[[Papanazes|PAPANAZES]]==, Indians of Brazil. See additional matter respecting the history, &c. of this kingdom.] 
==[[Papantla|PAPANTLA]]==, an alcaldia mayor and jurisdiction of Nueva Espana; for the most part of an hot and moist temperature, extending 15 leagues along the seacoast to the leeward of Vera Cruz, beginning at the bar of the renowned river of Nantla, where it is divided from that government, and running as far as the bar of Corazones, which serves as limits to the jurisdiction of Guauchinango, and as an impediment to even the smallest vessels to enter ; this however not being the case with the bar of Nantla ; for although over this the water is less deep by three or four yards, yet it is navigable for bilanders and small craft as far as the river of Los Barriles. This alcaldia has several other rivers, all abounding in various kinds of fish, and affording thereby a commerce to the natives. The shores of these rivers are lined with cedars, mulberries, and other trees for shipbuilding. Of these was the frigate called the Tecolutena built, and since that various others. This jurisdiction produces also much wax, which the Indians collect from the beehives abounding in the woods ; pitatrees, which they call here magueyes de lechugilla, and from the milk of which is distilled from the trees of Zapota, a kind of resin called chicle, serving as a medicine. On the mountains are found also fine baynilla, which is bought by traders to carry to Europe. The cultivation of tobacco, to which the soil is peculiarly adapted, was once the chief article of trade here, but its demand has diminished in proportion as its cul* tivation in the other provinces has become common. But the sugar cane is still cultivated to great profit, and of it loafsugar is made : also is cultivated maize, which yields two abundant crops annually, one in October, the other in April ; the only labour required in agriculture being the scratching up the ground with the point of a stake. Here is likewise grown a considerable portion of Chile pepper, fruit, gardenherbs, and common pepper, like that of Tabasco, despised by the Indians from the smallness of its worth. In the llanos are some ranchos, in which are bred some neat cattle and horses. 
Papantla, the capital, is the settlement of the same name. It contains 535 families of    PAP 
Mexican Indians, 15 of Spaniards, and 200 of Mulattoes, divided into two companies of militia. In its church is venerated an image of Nuestra Senora de la Concepcion, of beautiful sculpture, the which 140 years back was found by a mariner on the seashore in a closed chest, with a direction on the top, signifying Para Papantla, (for Papantla), and which, he having caused to be carried on the shoulders of Indians to the settlement, was opened in presence of many persons, the said image being discovered within. A temple was then built for it, and a devout brotherhood attached: 105 miles n.e. of Mexico, in lat. 20' 27' n. Long. 97° 36' SO" w.

==[[Para|PARA]]==, Gran, a province and captainship of the kingdom of Brazil, bounded n. by the kingdom of Granada, the provinces of Guyanas, and the great bay formed by the Atlantic sea at the entrance of the river of Las Amazonas, e. by the captainship of Maranan, s. by the provinces of Goias and Matto Groso and the kingdom of Peru, and w. by the kingdoms of Peru and Granada. It is watered by a river of the same name,  PARA.  which traverses it and enters the sea in the aforesaid bay. It is very fertile in sugar canes, of which sugar is made, as also in cotton, cacao, baynilla, and coffee, of which productions shipments were made annually to Lisbon. The climate is extremely hot, and in the woods is a variety of timber, excellent for either colour or durability, and amongst the which is a tree much esteemed, and called here umiri, the trunk of which distils a very fragrant balsam. Besides the aforesaid river, there are five others very large which irrigate this province, the Negro, Topajos, Cambeas, and Xingu, the which abound in fish, and in a particular sort, called the manaties. Their shoves are covered with woods, in which are a variety of birds and quadrupeds. All of them run into the Maranon. The islands of Joanes or Marajo, of Cahete and others, belong to this district. 
[The trade (observes Mr. Andrew Grant) between Brazil and Europe is chiefly carried on by three principal points, viz. Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, or the bay De Todos Santos, and Grand Para. 
The captainship of Grand Para is the most «. of any of the Portuguese settlements in Brazil. Belen, the capital, is situated on the banks of the river Para or Amazonas, and defended by a strong fortress, named Notre Dame de las Merces, erected at the mouth of the river De Muja, which forms the port of Para. This port is difficult of access, from the currents which run in different directions, and which are occasioned by a multitude of small islands, rendering the navigation of ships slow and uncertain. But when once they get into the harbour, they anchor in a muddy bottom, with four, five, or six fathoms of water. The canal which leads up to it grows, however, more shallow every day, and in a short time it will not be navigable, if, as it must be supposed, the waters continue to deposit as much earth as they have done for the last century. 
The foundation of Belen, which is situated at about 20 leagues from the sea, was laid in 1615 by Francis Caldeira. It stands on a spot of ground which rises about 13 feet above the level of the sea, and for a long time afforded only a mart for the articles collected by the wandering Indians in the neighbourhood, such as the wild cocoa, vai/nilla, tortoise and crabshells, sarsaparilla, different kinds of balsams, cotton, &c. 
The population of Belen amounts to about 10,000 souls. The same indolence, superstition, and ignorance which characterise the Portuguese in general, are evident among the inhabitants of  this city, though an equal degree of luxury does not prevail here as in the capitals of the more s. captainships. Another circumstance which has tended to modify the character of the Parabians is, that Negro slavery Avas introduced among them at a later period than in most of the other captainships. Too poor to purchase these devoted victims of injustice and tyranny, they were long forced to content themselves with what feeble assistance they derived from the natives, who were longer kept in a state of subjection in the n. parte of Brazil than in the captainships towards the s. 
In 1755 an exclusive company was appointed for Grand Para and Maranan, possessing a capital of about £ 125,000. Count d'Oyeras was at the head of this monopoly. It was permitted to gain 15 per cent, exclusive of all expences, on articles of provisions, and to sell its merchandise at 45 per cent, more than they would have cost even at Lisbon. This company was also empowered to make its own price for what provisions were furnished by the districts subject to its jurisdiction. These unjust and extraordinary privileges were granted to this company for 20 years, after which period they could be renewed by application to the government of Portugal. It is easy to conceive the tendency which such a company must have had in paralizing the efforts of the colonists ; and, in fact, it was not until 1778, at which period they were relieved from the oppression necessarily attending these exclusive privileges, that the colony began to exhibit any signs of prosperity. 
The principal commodities received from Para are sugar, which is prepared in more than SO ingenios, or sugar houses, in the interior of the district; coffee, cocoa, and Brazil wood, particularly that species called by the Portuguese burnpemina, which is beautifully veined, and from which an odoriferous oil is extracted ; the bark is also burnt as a perfume. 
From the bark of a tree, called araribd, which is very common in the neighbourhood of Para, the inhabitants extract a fine purple colour, which is said to be extremely permanent. A new species of puchari, or precious fruit, is also met with in this division of Brazil. It does not attain to such a large size as the common kind ; but the fruit is more aromatic, and forms an excellent substitute for nutmegs. The real jalaptree (convolvulus jalappa) abounds in Para ; as well as various kinds of contrayerva (dorstenia contrayerva), and many other medicinal plants.]  

PARA.  TBrazil abounds witli gums of different kinds, well calculated to supply the place of gum arable : the jutuicisica of Para is well calculated for makingsealingwax. Several parts of Para abound with yellow ochres (ochraferri), which is frequently intermixed with a red ochre, of as brilliant a colour as vermilion. White argil (argilla bolus alba), called by the colonists tabatinga ; and likewise red bole (argilla bolus rubra), is very common in different parts of the province. 
The animals in this province are similar to those in the other districts of Brazil. Formerly the sale of the flocks which grazed in the island of Marajo was one* of the principal resources of this colony ; but at present the number of oxen are greatly diminished. 
A large species of silkworm (phalena atlas), whose ball is three times the size of the common silkworm's, is found in great plenty in Para. It feeds on the leaves of the orangetrees, and the silk produced by it is of a dark yellow colour. Were this species cultivated with care, the silk obtained from them might prove a profitable article of commerce. The people of Minas Geraes have already set them the example, so far as regards the common silkworm. 
Eightyseven miles from Para, on descending the river of the Amazonas, is a large tongue of land formed into several islands, the largest of which, that of Joannes, is very populous, and defended by a small fort. These isles belong to different Portuguese nobles, and have the title of baronies. A league and a half from the city stands the town of St. Georges dos Alamos, with a regular fortress. About 84 miles s. w. on the borders and on the w. side of the river Tocantines is another town, named Camuta, or Cameta, with the fort of Gurupa : along the river are the forts of Paru, which the French took and destroyed in the year 1698, of Tapergos, and Rio Negro. To the n. the province of Para is terminated by Cayenne ; on this side it is limited by the n. cape, where stands the fort of Cumanha, opposite that of Camon and that of Dos Aragoariz. In this province are four cities or towns ; viz. Para, St. Georges dos Alamos, Camonta, and Cahete, and about fifty thousand inhabitants. 
The Portuguese formed new establishments on the Rio Negro, where they discovered diamond and gold mines : in 1766, four hundred soldiers and marines were sent from Lisbon, as well as workmen of all kinds ; and several families were tempted, by the great encouragement offered them, to join this expedition, with the view of settling in this part of Brazil.  
During war with any nation which may be in possession of Guayana, this district would be much exposed to invasion from that quarter. Its great distance from Bahia, and even from Para and Maranan, renders it next to impossible for these provinces to afford it the necessary aid to repel an invading foe. 
The new colony of Rio Negro was extremely illconducted by Francois Xavier de Mendoca, Minister of Marine. Sufficient advantages, indeed, have not yet been derived from this fine country, from the improper steps taken to colonize it. It is true that the population of this district has been augmented by many families who have been forced to abandon Guayana, from the bad success of the establishments attempted by France in the year 1764, along the banks of the Courou. It is a melancholy truth that colonization which, if conducted with wisdom and benevolence, might prove a blessing to mankind, has in general proved most ruinous to those unfortunate individuals who, attracted by the love of gain, or driven from their country by the pressure of want, have sought an asylum in those new establishments. 
The government of Para is dependent upon that of Maranan, and this is separated from that of Para on the n. by the river Tocantines. 
The Portuguese were driven upon this province by a storm in 1535, but did not form any settlement till 1599. The French, who invaded this colony in 1612, kept possession of it from that period till 1615, when it was wrested from them by the Dutch, from whom the Portuguese again recovered it in 1644. 
Before it was visited by the Portuguese, the chief employment of the savages was collecting the ambergrease which abounds on this part of the coast ; and this likewise became the occupation of the first European settlers. For many years after the resettlement of the Portuguese, Maranan continued in a very languishing state, till some of the more enterprising colonists began to cultivate cotton, which is said to be superior to any other raised in the New World. For several years past, rice (oryza mutica), a species which is natural to Brazil, and differing from the ary%a sativa, in not being furnished with awns, has also been cultivated to a considerable extent, though it is inferior to Levant rice, and even to that produced in N. America. 
Several attempts were lately made to produce silk in this colony ; but either from the unfitness of the climate, the improper methods employed in the management of the insects, or from some]  PARA.  
[other cause, the project has proved wholly abortive. The same want of success has not, however, attended the culture of indigo, as the numerous plantations of this valuable vegetable are in a flourishing condition, and promise amply to renumerate the proprietors. The finest Brazil arnotto is also brought from this district. 
The Island of St. Louis constitutes that part of the province of Marafian, which is by far the most populous. It is 26 leagues in circumference, extremely fertile, and only separated from the continent by a small river. The capital, which is also named St. Louis, was built by the French in 1612. The only public building it contains worthy of notice is the Episcopal Palace, the houses in general being illbuilt and inconvenient. This town is defended by a citadel and several forts, and is the residence of the governorgeneral of the three northern provinces. All the trade of the island is transacted here ; the harbour is capacious, but might be greatly improved by art. The population of the island is estimated at about 15 thousand souls. The plantations are not here equally flourishing with those on the continent, particularly on the banks of the rivers Ytapicorie, Mony, &c. 
Towards the eastern part of the interior of the province, the natives have not yet been reduced to complete subjection. This part of the country, which is elevated and of a sandy soil, is principally inhabited by shepherds. The surface of the ground, which is covered with saltpetre, is altogether appropriated to rearing horses and horned cattle, which are sold to considerable advantage in the neighbouring countries ; but the sheep degenerate there as well as in the other parts of Brazil, except about Coritibe. Unfortunately, the too frequent droughts, and the excessive heats, often destroy whole flocks, when sufficient attention is not paid to lead them in time to distant pastures. 
Mines of sulphur, alum, copperas, iron, lead, and antimony, are extremely common, though very superficial in these mountains, and yet none of them have been opened. In 1572, permission was indeed granted to work a silver one, which had been discovered three or four years before ; but the court soon after retracted this permission, for reasons that were never fully explained. 
This government consists of 8993 white men, 17,844 negroes, or free Mulattoes, and slaves ; and of 38,937 Indians, either scattered or assembled in 10 villages. The exports have not as yet been equal to this degree of population. Their  value has never been estimated at more than of 29,000 ; but since the suppression of the company already mentioned, it is to be presumed they must every year become more considerable. The ecclesiastical, the military, and civil establishment of Marafian, are on the same footing as those in the other captainships of Brazil. In matters of consequence, however, this province, as well as that of Grand Para, is allowed to appeal directly to the mothercountry, without being obliged to appear before the two intermediate tribunals of Bahia and Rio de Janeiro.] Para, Gran, the capital ofthe above province and captainship of the same name, and with the dedicatory title of Nuestra Seiiora de Belen. It is commercial, handsome, and rich, and adorned with beautiful edifices ; amongst these the most conspicuous are two parish churches, the convents ofthe monks of Nuestra Senora del Carmen, of La Merced, San Francisco, and S. Domingo, of the Capuchins and ofthe chapel of Christo, which belongs to the troops. It had a college of the Jesuits, under whose charge was a seminary for studies and the principal missions of the Marafian. It has a citadel and a castle called Nuestra Senora de Las Mercedes, at the entrance of the bar upon the river, both of them being furnished with plenty of good artillery of brass and iron, and garrisoned with four companies with a commandant and serjeantmajor. It is the head of a bishopric erected by pope Clement XI. at the instance of king D.Juan V. in 1720; Don Fr. Bartolome del Pilas, a Carmelite monk, beingnominated as its first bishop. It had, indeed, been made a bishop's see by pope Innocent XI. at the desire of king Peter II. and D. Fr. Manuel de la Natividad, provincial of the Capuchins of Corral, had been appointed to its functions, when D. Fr. Gregorio de Los Angeles, who had hitherto presided over it as belonging to the bishopric of Marafian, disputed the claims of the newcomer, and had litigations with the court of Rome, which were only put an end to by the death of the two rivals. 
The population of this city amounts to 4000 housekeepers. [Mr. Mawe, however, takes the present population at ten thousand inhabitants. 
The town of Para, continues the same traveller, is situated on the river of its name, called by some Tocantines, the navigation of which is difficult, and is seldom attempted, except by small craft : the Confiance sloop of war with great care mailed up it, and anchored near the town, several days previous to the expedition against Cayenne. The inhabitants are in general very]    

PAR  [poor, probably from want of commerce ; for although the great rivers Tocantines and Amazonas have their source, the latter in Peru, and the former in the captainship of Goyaz, though they receive almost millions of inferior streams in their course through immense tracks of territory, yet they are not productive of any commerce of consequence. The few exports from Para consist of a little rice and cocoa, a few drugs, &c. to Maranan, from whence they are embaiked for Europe. A few small brigs were sent hither from Barbadoes, after the taking of Cayenne : but the trade must be a bad one, as the inhabitants are in general too poor to purchase English manufactures, except those of necessity ; nor could the produce of Para be an object of interest, as a cargo is at all times very precarious, and difficult to be obtained. 
The climate is hot, as may well be supposed, from its lying so near the equinoctial. Thunder, with lightning and rain, occur generally every afternoon, which cool the air very much, and render the heat less disagreeable. 
To the s. of Para is the captainship of Goyaz, bounded chiefly by Minas Geraes on the e. and Matto Grosso on the w. Its greatest extent in length is from lat. 6" to 21° 30' s. Villa Boa, its principal town, is situate in lat. 16 1 2% s. about 270 miles to the w. of Paracatu, from whence there is a good road. Here is a permutationhouse, where all the gold found in the captainship is permuted. The governor is elected for three years, after which he is generally appointed to Bahia or Minas Geraes. In the captainship are many goldmines, some of which produce gold of a very fine quality. Diamonds have been found in some parts, which are different in their appearance from those found in Cerro do Frio, having more brilliancy on their exterior ; but they are in general not of so pure a water, though of a very desirable size. As this fine district is so distant from the coast, it has very little commerce in any of its productions, except the valuable substances abovementioned, and cattle, which are bred on the frontiers ; also some cotton, and occasionally a few peculiar articles, which are sent to Rio de Janeyro. The mules on the returnjourney are all loaded with salt, iron, cheap cottonprints, woollens (particularly baizes), hats, firearms, powder and shot, and a variety of artificers' tools. When any of the inhabitants have any thing peculiarly precious to dispose of, they generally take it to Rio de Janeyro, and lay out the proceeds chiefly in the purchase of Negroes (they being at all times the first object), iron, salt, and other commodities. 

VOL. IV.  
The population is very small in comparison to the extent of the district, but is likely to be increased by new settlers; although the indigent in Villa Rica, Tejuco, and other places in the mining country, are little inclined to remove out of society, even for the chance of riches ; in fact, having no Negroes fit to work, and being totally destitute of exertion themselves, all situations are to them indifferent. These are by no means the class of people who can be styled ad- ' venturers. The poorer class of inhabitants who have obtained a small portion of gold, sometimes make a journey to Paracatu or Villa Rica to purchase what Negroes they want. This captainship has been very little explored, and scarcely any thing is known of its productions beyond what is above stated, nor are any others sought after, though it cannot be doubted that there are many substances in all departments of natural history which might form the basis of a considerable commerce ; indeed, it is not unreasonable to presume that the soil contains the same variety of metals as the district of Minas Geraes. Many persons from thence speak of it with delight as being a fine country, having numerous rivers well stored with fish, and woods abounding with fine birds, which afford excellent diversion to the sportsman : also a great variety of animals. 
Para, together with Matto Grosso, and St. Paul's, communicates with the captainship of Goyas, by rivers which are navigable, though frequently interrupted by falls. The capital of Para is 60 miles from the mouth of the river, in lat. 1° 30' s. and Ion. 48° 33' w.~\ 
Para, a river of the above province and kingdom, on the e. side of which the capital of this kingdom is situate. It is, properly speaking, one of the mouths of the Amazonas, formed by the island of Joanes, about 40 miles wide at its mouth. [This river is about 200 miles long.] 
Para, another, a small river of the province and captainship of Espiritu Santo in the same kingdom, rising in the mountains near the coast, running n. and forming various lakes. It then turns n. e. and enters the Paranauna with the name of Paracatus, opposite the settlement of Rosario.

[==[[Paracatu|PARACATU]]==, is the principal village or town of a district of the same name, which lies about 90 leagues n. w. of Tejuco, bordering on the captainship of Goyas in Brazil, from which it is separated by a chain of high mountains that take a n. direction. The numerous rivers which rise on the e. side of the mountains, and flow into the great river St. Francisco, are rich in gold. The population of the village is estimated at above 1000 souls, and will shortly be very numerous, as the reputed richness of some late discoveries has tempted many families to migrate thither. It has all the advantages of a high and healthy situation, in the midst of a most fertile country and has considerable intercourse with Sabora and Villa Rica, where the gold procured in its vicinity is permuted. It is governed by a captain Mor, who is subordinate to the governor of the latter place, to whom all disputes of consequence are referred. To the *. is the rich distacamento of Rio Plata, a river that yields fine diamonds, and has been much frequented by many adventurers, who, when discovered and seized, are called smugglers. A strong guard ot soldiers is stationed here to prevent the precious stones from being sought for clandestinely.]

==[[Paraguay|PARAGUAY]]==, a province and government of Peru, belonging to the viceroyalty of Buenos Ayres ; bounded by, or, more properly speaking, extending, on the n. as far as, the lake Los Xarayes, [which by the by is only the inundation of several rivers beginning in January and lasting three months] from whence issues the great river Paraguay, which gives its name to the country ; extending e. as far as Brazil, and bounded s. by the missions of Parana, its jurisdiction ending at the river to the s. of the city of Asuncion, in lat. 26° 48' s. although it formerly extended as far as the embouchure of the river Parana, in lat. 27° 38'. It is bounded w. by the country of Gran Chaco, inhabited by many nations of infidel Indians, extending as far as the borders of the province of Tucuman, and divided from thence by the river Paraguay. Its extent is about 200 Italian miles from e. to w. and more than 300 from n. to s. It was discovered by Sebastian Gaboto in 1526 ; is of a warm and moist temperature, from the number of woods, lakes, and rivers, with which it is covered, and from the various swamps, which are formed between the months of November and April, when the rains are most abundant. It is watered by an infinite number of rivers, the principal of which are, first that of its own name, and then those in the n. parts of Porrudos, Mboteley, Tobati, Ipane Piray, and others of less note ; and in the s. part, those of Caiiabe and Tibiquari, this dividing this province from that of the Rio de la Plata of Buenos Ayres. 
The woods are many and impenetrable, and in them grow in abundance sour oranges, citrons, limes, and other wild fruits, of which conserves are made. There are also trees of very good timber, and fine wood, such as cedars, petoroques, urundais, tqjibos, and others ; of the first they make canoes and slabs, which they carry to Buenos Ayres for careening vessels and for other uses. In these woods are found a variety of birds and animals, such as rabbits, hares, partridges, wildboar, deer, and other species of creatures less known, such as quiriquinchos,mulitas, and ape-    riades ; but from the great quantity of neat cattle, the flesh of which is preferred to any other here, none of the above animals are ever hunted: sometimes, however, the inhabitants will hunt geese, which abound in the lakes and the shores of the river, and kill great numbers. Here also breed goldfinches, nightingales, larks, green parrots, longtailed parrots, others of most beautiful plumage, and peacocks ; nor are there wanting ostriches, and birds of prey ; amongst which there is one called tuca, resembling the crow, but having a beak which is singular, from being the length of a hand, and beautifully variegated with a distribution of red, yellow, and black streaks. The water in which the tongue of this bird, which is a feather, has been steeped, is a sovereign remedy against the epilepsy, as has been proved by repeated experiments made in this country. 
•The most ferocious animal is the tiger, of which there are great numbers, and which do great havoc amongst the cattle and the people. Here are bears, which are anteaters, with very long tongues ; and these they put into an ant's nest, and when they feel it covered with these insects they withdraw it, delighting in their food. Here is also found the great beast called the anta, and many monkies of various kinds, called in the language of the country carayas. What are here called lions have no resemblance to those of Africa either in shape or ferocity. 
On the shores of the rivers breeds an animal called capihuara, which is amphibious, lives in the water, and breeds on land ; it resembles the pig, and differs from it only in the snout, which is shorter and less pointed. Nothing abounds in this province more than insects, and of these the plague of mosquitoes is equally distressing on the waters as on the land. Here are snakes both small and large, vipers, scorpions, &c. and in some parts abound the murcielagos, which suck the blood of a person asleep, and endanger his life should he not awake in time Also, it is not uncommon to see a species of butterfly, called utas, which, in whatever part it bites, causes a humour to appear like gum, and then corrodes the part, forming a nidus for a little worm, which, although extracted, leaves behind an unseemly wound, which increases daily, and is only got rid of by a very particular and tedious method of cure. 
The principal commerce of this province is in certain species of leaves of trees, which grow on some -mountains about 100 leagues from the capital, known by the name of the herb of Pariguay. In the gathering and preparing of this f 2  PARAGUAY.  i  herb both natives and strangers are employecf, and the operation consists in drying the leaves, which are scattered on shelves for the purpose over a fire, when thej are crumbled into bits no bigger than sawdust ; and then they are put up into packages of from seven to eight arrobas each. There are two sorts of this leaf; the first, and which is most esteemed, is that which is made of the tender part of the leaves, and is called herb camini ; the other, the inferior sort, is made of the thick part of the leaves, and has the name of herb de Pahs. The consumption of this article, not only in these provinces but in those of Peru and Chile, is incredible, since there is scarcely any person who does not take it two or three times in the course of the day, making an infusion of it like tea, with warm water and sugar, and calling it mate. 
The second great article of commerce is the tobacco, although the exports of this have not been so great since that the king has established a manufactory of slack and twisted tobacco, on account of the royal warehouses. 
They also make some sugar here, and gather a good quantity of cotton ; and the product of these articles, which are carried to Buenos Ayres, returns in the shape of European goods. Its only communication with the province of the Rio de la Plata is by the Paraguay, and the shipments from one place to the other are never less than 12,000 arrobas annually : not but that the journey is sometimes performed by land, but then it is along the coast of the river, and never undertaken but by the couriers, or some persons by way of express, who lay themselves open to the inconvenience and necessity of passing many rivers by wading or swimming, there being no ferries, and likewise to the continual risk of .being surprised by the infidel Indians, who are constantly prowling along the river's banks : but it must be allowed that this latter objection is equally applicable to such as make the voyage ; since the Payaguas Indians who dwell upon the shores of the river are terrible pirates,, infesting the passage with their canoes, and joining 60 or 70 of them together, there being in each six or seven men armed with lances and clubs ; so that it is necessary for vessels to go supplied with plenty of ammunition or under convoy. 
A few years since a peace was made with these Indians, and although great insolence was at first manifested by them as barbarians, many of them have become domesticated and live in the vicinity of the capital, where they make themselves useful by supplying fish. 
Nearly the whole of this province is sur-  rounded by enemies, who have never ceased to invade it since its foundation. These enemies are, to the w. the barbarian Indians, the Lenguas, Tobas, and Moscobies ; on the s. the Abipones ; on the n. the tribe of Guaycurus, commonly called Mbayas, and the Panaguas ; and in the e. part alone is it free from any immediate host ; not but that on the mountains of the Yerva dwell the Monteses, who although they do not infest the settlements, give great annoyance to the parties employed in procuring the herb paraguay,and have even, not unfrequently, attacked the Indians who have been reduced to the faith and have settled on the frontiers ; and very lately the Portuguese of Brazil, when, having destroyed the various settlements on the e. and the city of Xerez on the n. which served as an outwork of defence against them, they pushed forward in that direction by the passage at which, at the present day, stand the settlements of Cubava and Matogroso, as far as the head settlements of the Moxos, to establish a commerce with Santa Cruz de la Sierra and La Paz ; for these infidels, like ants, once convinced of the existence of a booty, although turned a thousand times out of their course, will still keep travelling on in pursuit of their object. 
All the aforesaid infidels have frequently invaded, and still continue to invade, this country in the most unseasonable and unexpected times, when they put to death all they meet, plundering the women and children, and laying waste whatever comes in their way. They have at times made peace with different nations, but they break such alliances with the greatest impudence, and for this system of conduct the Guaycurus, a ferocious and intractable race, are peculiarly notorious. 
In order to guard against these enemies which thus threaten the existence of the province, the inhabitants have found it necessary to enrol themselves in a volunteer militia, procuring arms and horses at their own expence, and forming themselves into garrisons in such parts as may be most required ; and, although this duty is somewhat irksome, an arrangement has been lately made by which each individual is dispensed from actual service for 22 days in each month, whenever the steps taken by the enemy may not require it otherwise : but should these, as it frequently happens, lay hands on the cattle or other goods of the community, they are all  obliged to come  into the field to redeem their possessions, and the persons thus called into service are indemnified by a fund, called the Composition Fund, which arises from certain  

PARAGUAY.  mulcts exacted from such as will not attend ; the amount of these being 60 dollars for the federative part of the inhabitants, and 40 for the others. These dollars are not however of current coin, but their value is taken in the articles and merchandises of the country, seldom more than onefourth being paid in specie ; a system equally adhered to in the commercial intercourse with Buenos Ayres. 
The presidios, or garrisons of this province, are 19 in number, without counting the capital, in which is a body of 350 guardsmen, (as well of infantry as of horse), and of the following names : 
San Miguel, on the shore of the river. San Ildefonso, the same, and five leagues from the capital. 
San Joseph, eight leagues within land. Arecutacoa, 12 leagues on the coast. La Emboscada, two leagues from the former. Mandoviray, on the shore of the river Tobati, at 18 leagues. 
Mainrimbi, eight leagues from the former. Urunday-Yuru, three leagues from the former, in land. 
San Geronimo, without the walls of the city, on the coast. 
Lam bare, two leagues from the city.. San Marcos, four leagues off. La Villeta, 10 leagues off. El Reducto, 12 leagues off. Santa Rosa, a league from the former, removed from the coast. 
San Fernando, two leagues from the river Tibiquari, and 40 from the city. That of Villarica. That of Curuguati. 
Besides these there are some boats to run along the coasts to impede the passes to the infidels, or to surprise and cut off their retreats. The aforesaid garrisons are not only a check to the Indians, but they can exclude from the navigation of the river any foreign vessel, independently that it requires great skill in any navigator unexperienced with these parts not to take a wrong course, from the number of mouths and creeks which present themselves, and which have often misled. 
The population of this province consists of two towns, called Espiritu Santo, and Villarica ; and of the following settlements of Indians-  
Ipane,  Tobati,  Guarambare,  Los Altos,  Ita,  Itape,  Yaguarin,  Caazapa,  Altira,  Yuti.  
£n which are 6000 inhabitants of all ages, men, women, and children ; and these united to the number contained in the town and vallies give a total of 56,000. 
The greater part are of the Guarani nation, descendants of those who were converted by San Francisco Solano and his companions, with the exception of some families of the Monteses, Canguias, and other nations since reduced. Here are also four new reduccions made, which were under the charge of the Jesuits, called San Estanislao, San Joaquin, Nuestra Senora de Belen, and El Santo Corazon. In each of these settlements is an Indian corregidor without jurisdiction, and appointed only to regard the proceedings of the other corregidors, and to cause to be fulfilled the orders of the curate and of the administrator of the goods of the settlement. Each of them has two alcaldes, and the other officers of the cabildo, and these, as well as the corregidor, are elected by the influence of the curate, who knows the abilities of his Indians ; but these elections are afterwards confirmed by the governor of the province ; and to the curate is assigned 10 per cent, of the profits of his settlement. Ever since the first establishment of these settlements, there is allotted to each the territory thought necessary for sowing of seeds and the breeding of cattle, and when the harvest is gathered in, it is put into one common granary, to the end that it may be divided equally amongst all, as their necessities may require, by the administrator ; the same practice being observed with regard to the rations of meat. With the excess of the corn and cattle a means is procured of adorning the churches, of assisting the sick, and of promoting public works. Neither Spaniards, Mulattoes, nor Negroes are admitted into these settlements except as traders. 
The ecclesiastical government is well organized under the religious order of San Francisco, and amongst the first converters are enumerated Fr. Alonso de Buenaventura, and Fr. Juan de San Bernardo, a laybrother, who suffered martyrdom under the Caazapas Indians. At daybreak mass is said every morning, with fine music, and on festival days somewhat later, with a discourse regularly by the curate. This finished, the cabildo goes to receive its orders for the day, and the same are imparted to the whole settlement, that every one may know his occupation. The matrons have their tasks assigned to them proportionate to their strength and capacity, and the unmarried and girls remain singing and reciting prayers for the morning, after the mass is finished, in the courtyard of the  PARAGUAY.  church, and repeat the same at nightfall. The rest of the day they are employed in assisting their mothers, whilst the men are employed in different handicraft works, as carpentering, sculpture, musical instrument making, weaving, and other mechanical arts and employments, for which they have excellent masters. Every night the cabildo comes to the curate to inform him of what has happened in the course of the day, and the people, after saying the rosary, betake themselves to rest. 
These Indians cannot be said to pay any other tribute than personal service to those under whom they live, notwithstanding it has been attempted by the king to introduce a different sys-  tem. In the settlement of Itape, for instance, there is no vassalage, but the Indians there assist with their persons and rafts all those who pass in the time of the floods a large arm of the river Tibiquari, by which lies the road to Villarica. 
This province has suffered, from its first formation, various convulsions and alterations, from being divided into parties, formed from vain ideas of honour or interest, and has been the scene of great bloodshed. To its bishopric, which was erected in 1547, belong also the settlements of Parana, situate to the s.e. and of which we speak in their proper place. [See Paraguay River.]

Governors of the province of Paraguay. 
1. Don Manuel de Frias, first governor of this province ; nominated by the king, when it was separated from the jurisdiction of the province of the Rio de la Plata, and when the limits of both were settled in 1620: he had many disputes with the bishop, with respect to the rights of patronage ; when this prelate thought proper to excommunicate him, and to take the adminstration of the settlements out of the hands of the missions of the Jesuits ; a step which was condemned by the council of the Indies: he governed till 1630. 
2. Don Luis de Cespedes, distinct from another of the same name who was governor of Buenos Ayres and the Rio de la Plata : he took possession of the government of Paraguay the aforesaid year, and exercised it till 1636. 
3. Don Martin de Ledesma, nominated to succeed the former : he governed till 1639. 
4. Don Pedro de Lugo y Navarro, knight of the order of Santiago : he had a commission from the king to visit the settlements of the missions of the Jesuits, and to give them redress and protection against the insults of the Mamelucos Indians : he succeeded in completely routing these, and thereby revenged the death of his friend and companion, father Romero, a Jesuit, who was killed by them : he governed till 1642. 5. Don Gregorio de Hinestrosa, native of Chile, in whose time occurred the disgraceful dissentions between the bishop Don Fr. Bernardino de Cardenos and the Jesuits, the which laid the foundation of the disorders which this province afterwards suffered, and which were not put a stop to till that the governor removed the bishop of its diocess, he being, in return, thrice excommunicated : this government lasted for five years, until 1648. 
6. Don Diego de Escobar Osorio, oidor of the royal audience of Charcas, who, from the critical state in which affairs were left by his predecessor, reigned but a short time ; for his death was hastened, and he died in 1649. 
7. Don Fr. Bernardino de Cardenos, bishop of this diocess, who was tumultuously proclaimed by his partizans as governor in the vacancy : he began his reign by exterminating the Jesuits from the city, as well as from the other settlements, and causing them to leave the country 
G  PARAGUAY.  
.  and to embark, with great violence. This gave rise to fresh disputes, and the Jesuits, by vh'tue of the pontifical bull which they possessed, established a judge conservator. In the mean time the audience of Charcas disapproved this intrusive government, and nominated, provisionally, 
8. Don Andres Garavito of Leon, knight of the order of Santiago, oidor of the aforesaid audience of Charcas, and whilst he was proceeding to his destination, Don Sebastian de Leon, a colonel, who was rejected by the bishop, who defended himself by some armed Indians ; but these dissentions were soon put to an end on the arrival of the aforesaid governor Garavito ; and he took possession of the government and held it till 1651, when he returned to the duties of his place. 
9. Don Juan Vazquez of Valverde, oidor of the same royal audience as the former, and nominated by it as provisional governor, with a special commission of visiting the province, and of examining into the late occurrences : he entered the government in 1661 and held it till 1665. 
10. Don Felipe Rege Corbulon, till 1679. 
11. Don Juan Diaz de Andino, till 1685, when he died. 
12. Don Antonio de Vera Moxica, nominated provisionally by the viceroy of Peru. 
13. Don Baltasar Garcia Ros, serjeantmajor of the plaza of Buenos Ayres, appointed here as a recompense by the king, for his services performed in the conquest of the colony of Sacramento, established by the Portuguese on the shore of the river La Plata of Buenos Ayres :  he entered the government in 1705, with a particular charge to make the visit of the settlements of the missions of the Jesuits, which he did, rendering an accurate account of his discoveries to his majesty. 
14. Don Juan Gregorio Bazan de Pedraza. 
15. Don Diego de los Reyes Balmaseda, native of the port of Santa Maria : he entered in 1717, but the constant complaints made against him, and particularly of his partiality towards the Jesuits, obliged the audience of Charcas to nominate a provisional judge visitor, the same being made also provisional governor by the viceroy of Peru in 1721, and the person so appointed was, 
16. Don Joseph de Antequera y Castro, knight of the order of Alcantara, fiscalprotector of the Indians of the audience of Charcas. His unlucky stars had brought him hither to meet his death on a scaffold^, in the city of Lima, through  some riots which had lately arisen by certain misunderstandings between the bishop Don Fr. Joseph de Palos and the Jesuits. 
17. Don Martin de Barua, nominated provisionally by the fieldmarshal Don Bruno Mauricio de Zavala, by special commission of the viceroy, the marquis del Castelfuerte, to pacify the province, the administration of which underwent some changes from some representations which he made to the king concerning the Jesuits : he governed five years. 
18. Don Bartolome de Aldunate, captain of horse of the garrison of Buenos Ayres: who did not arrive to take possession, although nominated by the king. 
19. Don Iquacio de Soroeta, who had been corregidor of Cuzco : accredited for his skill and justice, and nominated by the viceroy of Peru in 1730 : his entry was disputed by the inhabitants, who took up arms against him, and obliged him to fly. 
20. Don Isedro Mirones y Benavente, oidor of the audience of Charcas, whose prudence and talents, testified by his pacification of the disturbances of the province of Cochabamba, led to his election to Paraguay by the viceroy, that he might call his talent into action on similar circumstances ; but, whilst on his journey, he received intelligence that the proper successor appointed by H. M. had arrived ; and upon this he returned to his former office. 
21. Don Manuel Augustin de Ruiloba, who was general of Callao, and general of the armies of Peru, when he entered Asuncion, 1733 ; but being out with a troop, and some Indians of the missions, for the purpose of quelling some disturbances, and being deserted by his party, he fell a sacrifice at the hands of the insurgents in the same year. 
22. Don Fr. Juan de Arregui, of the order of San Francisco, bishop of this diocess, and proclaimed governor by the insurgents ; and, although he was endeavouring to escape secretly from the city, he was brought back and forced to reign till the arrival of the judge Don Juan Vazquez de Aguero, as visitor, nominated by the 
23. Don Bruno Mauricio de Zavola, fieldmarshal and governor of Buenos Ayres ; promoted to the presidency of Chile, and ordered by the viceroy, the Marquis de Castelfuerte, to proceed with a force to Paraguay, to quell the disturbances there ; accordingly causing himself to be acknowledged governor, in 1735 he dispersed the insurgents, inflicted punishment on the chief  

PARAGUAY.  offenders, and reestablished the peace of the province ; afterwards, by a special commission from the Viceroy, he resigned the goverment to, 
24. Don Martin Joseph de Echaure, captain of dragoons : he remained here till 1755. 
25. T)on Rafael de laMoneda. 
26. Don Marcos Larrazabal.

28. Don Joaquin de Alos, formerly captain of the infantry regiment of Aragon and Corregidor ofQuispicanchiinPeru : nominated in 1785. 
Paraguay, a river which gives its name to the former province, and was first navigated by Sebastian Gabota, a Venetian, in 1526 : it rises in the great lake of LosLareyes orLaraye, in lat. 24° 18' s. and runs from n. to s. as far as the river Corrientes, and from thence s.w. to the city of Asuncion. Here it again takes its course to the s. to unite itself with the rivers Parana and Virmejo, in lat. 27° 41' s. On the w. near its banks, dwell the nations of the Guaicurus and Abipones Indians, and on the e. the Guaranies, Tobatines and Payaguas. This river is joined by the Tibaquira, Laiiabe, Upacay or Pirayu, Xexuy, Pilcomayo, Confuso, Guarumbare, Yuguy, Mboeri, Verde, Corrientes, and others of less size. The Portuguese of the colony of Sacrament, used to pass from the Parana to this river to get to the river Icipotiva or Yauri, by which they went to Matogroso, which is near the shore of the Itenes, w of the mines ofCuyaba. This river has many islands, abounds in excellent fish, and its shores are covered with lofty trees, which form extremely thick woods, in which dwell a multitude of rare birds and animals. 
[The fine river Paraguay (observes Mr. Mawe, the traveller) has its remote springs to the w. of the heads of the Arinas, in lat. 13° and after a s. course of 600 leagues, enters the ocean under the appellation of the Rio de la Plata. The heads of the Paraguay are 270 miles n. e. from Villa Bella, and 164 miles n. from Cuiaba, and divided into many branches, and already forming complete rivers ; which, as they run s. successively unite, and form the channel of this immense river, which is immediately navigable. To the w. a short distance from the main source of the Paraguay is that of the Sypotuba, which disembogues on its w. bank, in lat. 15° 50' after a course of 60 leagues. In the upper part of this river, and near its w. branch, called the Jurubanba, was formerly a gold mine, which was worked with considerable profit ; but the supe-  rior advantages derived from others subsequently explored in Matto Grossoand Cuiba, caused it to be abandoned, and its site is not now known with certainty. The little river Cabaral, also auriferous, enters the Paraguay on the w. side three leagues below the mouth of the Sypotuba. On the banks of the latter lives a nation of Indians, called Barbados, from the distinction peculiar to themselves, among all the Indian nations, of having large beards. 
The Boriras Araviras inhabit the banks of the Cabaral : they are a mixture of two different nations, who in the year 1797 sent four chiefs of their tribe, accompanied by their mother, to Villa Bella, in order to solicit the friendship of the Portuguese. The nation called Pararione lives in their neighbourhood, close by the Sypotuba. A league below the mouth of the Cabaral, on the e. bank of the Paraguay, is Villa Maria, a small and useful establishment, founded in 1778. Seven leagues s. of Villa Maria, and on the w. bank of the Paraguay, the river Jauru disembogues into it in lat. 16° 24'. This river is remarkable for the boundarymark erected at its mouth in 1754, as well as for being entirely Portuguese, together with lands on its s. bank, and bordering on tbe Spanish possessions. It rises in the plains of the Parexis in lat. 13° 54', and long. 58° 14', and running s. to lat. 15° 43', the situation of the Register of the same name, it there turns to the s. e. for 60 miles, till, by an entire course it reaches its junction with the Paraguay. There are saltwaterpits, which in part have supplied Matto Grosso ever since its foundation with salt : they are in the interior of the country, seven leagues from the Register, and extend to a place called Salina de Almeida, from the name of the person who first employed himself in these works. 
These saltpits are situate along the margins of broad marshy bottoms, in which are found fish of the same kind with those in the Paraguay. The Salina de Almeida is not far distant from the bank of the Jauru, and the great quantity of saline liquid found in it continues three leagues further to the s. where a junction is formed with another from the w. called Pitas, w. of which are high and dry plains, where are found numerous large circles, formed by a species of palm called Carandas. These plains terminate nine leagues w. of the Salina de Almeida, in a large pool of marsh, called Paopique, which runs to the s. 
The confluence of the Jauru with the Paraguay is a point of much importance : it guards and covers the great road between Villa Bella Cuia-} g2    44  

PARAGUAY.    [ba, and their intermediate establishments, and in the same manner commands the navigation of both the rivers, and defends the entrance into the interior of the latter captainship. The Paraguay from this place has a free navigation upwards, almost to its sources, which are scarcely 70 leagues distant, with no other impediment than a large fall. These sources are said to contain diamonds. 
The mark placed at the mouth of the Jauru is a pyramid of beautiful marble, brought to this distant point from Lisbon. It bears inscriptions commemorative of the treaty between the courts of Spain and Portugal, by which the respective territories, of which it stands as the boundary, were defined. 
The lofty chain of mountains, which extends from the sources of the Paraguay near its e. bank, border the river opposite the mouth of the Jauru, and are terminated seven leagues below it by the Morro Excalvado in lat. 16° 43'. E. of this mount or point, all is marsh, and nine leagues below it there flows into the e. side of the Parao-uay a deep stream or river, called Rio Novo, discovered in 1786, which may hereafter afford a navigation to near St. Pedro del Rey, when the aquatic plants that obstruct its channel are removed. The most distant sources of this river are the rivulets of Sta. Anna, Bento Gomez, and others which cross the great road of Cuiaba to the w. of Cocaes. In lat. 17° 33', the w. banks of the Paraguay become mountainous at the n. point of the Serra da Insua, which, three leagues to the s. makes a deep break to form the mouth of the lake Gaiba. This lake extends w. and there is a broad canal of four leagues in extent, which comes from the n. communicating from the above lake to that of Uberava, somewhat larger than the Gaiba, situated exactly contiguous to the Serra da Insua, on its n. side. Six leagues and a half below the mouth of the Gaiba, and opposite this mountainous bank of the Paraguay, is the mouth of the St. Louren<jo, formerly called Porrudos. Twentysix leagues above this the river Cuiaba enters its w. bank in lat. 17° 20', and long. 56° 50' : these two rivers are of great extent ; that of Louren^o has its sources in lat 15°, 40 leagues e. of the town of Cuaiba, receiving (besides the branches crossed by the road from Goiaz) other great streams on its e. side, such as the Paraiba or Piquiri, which receives the Jaquari and the Itiquira, all of moderate size, and navigable. The Itiquira has been navigated to its heads, from whence the canoes were dragged over land to the Sucuriu, which falls into the  
Parana four leagues below the mouth of the river Tiete on the opposite side. The rivers Itiquira and Sucuriu were found to have fewer and smaller falls than the Taquari, and the land passage is much shorter and more convenient than that of the Camapuao, so that this navigation is preferable to that by the two lastmentioned rivers : it is attended by only two obstacles — many Indians, and a want of provisions. 
The navigation to the town of Cuiaba by the river of that name, from its abovementioned confluence, is short and easy : in the first 10 leagues, after passing the two small islands on Ariacuni and Tarumas, occurs a large plantation of bananas, formed on an embankment on the e. side of the river. Three leagues above this place the Guachouassu enters the Cuiaba by its e. bank, and on the same side, seven leagues farther, the Guachomirim. From this point the river winds in a n. n. e. direction, 11 leagues to the island of Pirahim, and from thence makes a large bend to the e. receiving numerous streams, and passes the town of Cuiaba, which is situated a mile to the e. of it. This town is 96 leagues to the e. of Villa Bella, snd the same distance by water from the confluence of its river with the Paraguay. It is large, and, together with its dependencies, may at present contain 30,000 souls. It is well provided with meat, fish, fruits, and all sorts of vegetables, at a much cheaper rate than at the seaports. The country is well adapted for cultivation, and has rich mines, but in some places little water to work them in dry weather. They were discovered in 1718, and have been estimated to produce annually above 20 arrobas of gold of extremely fine quality. 
Twenty leagues*, w. of the town of Cuiaba is the settlement of St. Pedro del Rev, the largest of all the adjacent settlements, and contains full 2,000 inhabitants. It is situate near the w. side of the rivulet Bento Gomez, which, at the distance of a league and a half s. of the settlement, forms a large bay, called Rio de Janeiro. The river Cuiaba has its sources 190 miles above the town, and its banks are cultivated through the greater part of its extent, including^ 14 leagues below the town, down the stream. Four leagues below the principal mouth of the river Porrudos, the Paraguay is bordered by the mountains that separate it from Gaiba on its w. bank, and in this place they obtain the appellation of Serra das Pedras de Amolar, from being composed of a stone of which whetstones are made. This is the only spot which is not inundated by the floods of the river, and is therefore much visited by the canoes]  

PARAGUAY.  [that navigate it. These Serras terminate two leagues to the s. in those of the Dourados, immediately below which there is a channel on the w. side of the Paraguay, which, piercing between the two high detached mounts, called Cheines, leads to the lake Mendiuri, six leagues long, and the largest on the Paraguay. 
From the Dourados, the Paraguay runs s. to the Serras of Albuquerque, where it touches directly on the n. point, on which is situated a town of that name. These Serras form a compact square of 10 leagues, and contain much calcareous stone ; the land is considered the best on either side the Paraguay, from the river downwards, and only equalled by that on the w. margins of the lakes Mandiuri and Gaiba. From Albuquerque the Paraguay, turns to the s. w. It skirts its Serras, which terminate at the end of six leagues higher up in the Serra do Rabicho, opposite which, on the n. bank of the river, is situated the lower s. mouth of the Paraguaymirim. This is an arm of the Paraguay, which, terminating here, forms an island ll leagues in length from n. to s. : it is the usual channel for canoes in times of inundation. From the mouth of the Paraguaymirim the river takes a s. direction to the mouth of the Taquari, navigated annually by flotillas of canoes and other craft, which come from St. Paul's to Cuiaba, and even as far as the Register of Jauru, when their destination happens to be Villa Bella. 
As this navigation is an object of great importance, from its connecting two distinct districts, the following compendious description of the rout pursued in it may not prove uninteresting. It is abstracted from the diary of a man of science, who performed the journey a few years ago, in the month of October, when the Paraguay begins to retire to its own channel. The description may commence at the Taquari, as the voyage from thence to Cuiaba and the Jauru has already been detailed. The largest of the many mouths of the Taquari in the Paraguay is in lat. 19° 12',  and long. 54° 5  
In the first ten leagues of navi-  gation,the channel of the river is lost, as it crosses some large plains, covered with water to the depth of several feet. This is contiguous to Taquari, a place where the river is much confined. 
From this place it is 20 leagues to the restingplace of Allegre, in lat. 18° 12', and this space contains, on both banks of the Taquari, many entrances into the paths, which lead in time of the floods to various distant places on the Paraguay, Porrudos, and Cuiaba. From this restingplace there are 30 leagues of navigation, on the  course of the river e. to the fall of Barra, where it is impeded and unnavigable above a mile, though a part of it may be passed in a halfloaded and part in empty canoes. At the head of this fall the river Cochim enters the Taquari, and the navigation here quits the latter for the Cochim. At its mouth it is 20 fathoms broad, and a league upwards receives on its s. bank the Taquarimirim, a river nearly as broad as itself. A little above this confluence is situated its first fall, which is called Da Ilha, and may be passed in empty canoes. A league above is the fall of Giquitaya, passed with half cargoes, and a league and a quarter farther, that of the Choradeira, the current of which is very rapid. Beyond this is the fall of Avanhandavauassu, where the cargoes are carried over land for half a mile, and the canoes are conducted through a difficult channel of three fathoms, at the end of which they are pushed over the rocks in order to pass the head or cataract. Half a league above is the fall Do Jauru, so called from a river of that name, which enters the Cochim above it, on the n. side. From this confluence upwards there occurs seven falls in the course of five leagues and a half, in the midst of which distance the river cuts and is enchannelled in a mountain, through which it runs smoothly, although scarcely, five fathoms broad, and receives on its s. side the stream of the Paredao, which is said to be auriferous. Half a league above the last of the seven falls beforementioned are three successive ones, called Tres Irmaos, and at an equal distance above them, that of Das Furnas, which is passed laboriously with canoes unloaded. From this place the navigation continues on the Cochim through a succession of falls, until that river is joined by the Camapuao, eight yards in breadth at its mouth. From this point to its junction with the Taquari, the course of the Cochim is 30 leagues. 
The river Camapuao, along which the navigation is continued, becomes narrower on passing some rivulets that flow into it, and so shallow, as to be in general scarcely two feet deep, and the canoes are rather dragged than navigated along its sandy bed. After two leagues of this labour, they quit the Camapuaouassu, leaving it on the right hand, choked with fallen trees, &c. and enter into the Camapuaomirim, up which they proceed one league, when they reach the fazenda, or estate of the same name. This is an important establishment, belonging to the Portuguese, in the centre of those vast and desert regions that interverne between the great rivers Paraguay and Parana, 90 leagues s. s. w. in a direct line]  

MH  PARAGUAY.  ffrom the town of Cuiaba. The place seems very proper for a Register, to prevent the smuggling of gold in this route, and to fix the duties on goods passing to Cuiaba and Motta Grosso. The canoes and cargoes are transported from the Fazenda de Camapuao by land about a mile to the river Sanguixuga, the principal source of the Rio Pardo. From the end of the land passages the navigation continues down the Sanguixuga, and, in the interval of three leagues, they pass four falls to the Rio Vermelho (so called from the colour of its waters), which enters the Pardo. Half a league from the mouth of the Vermelho the Pardo has the fall of the Pedras de Amolar, and a league below receives on its s. side the river Claro, from which, after proceeding two leagues of level stream, there occur nine falls in the space of two leagues more. The passage of them occupies 12 or 14 days in going up the river, though only one returning. Below the last of these, called the Bangue, the river Sucuriu enters the Pardo on its s. side. Three leagues below the mouth of the Sucuriu, is the cataract of Curare, about eight yards high, to avoid which the canoes are hauled overland through a passage of 100 yards. From this cataract, in the space of 10 leagues, there occur 10 falls, which occupy 15 or 20 days, in ascending the river, though only one in descending. The breadth of the Rio Pardo in this part is 22 fathoms. Two leagues below the last of these falls is a deep inlet of 390 fathoms ; half a league lower the canoes are hauled over a space of land of 150 yards. Haifa league further is the fall of Sirga Negra ; one league further, that of Sirga Matto ; and a little more than a league from thence, the great cataract, or Salto da Cajuru, ten yards in height, to avoid which, the canoes are hauled through a narrow channel here formed by the river. At a distance equal to the preceding is the Cajurumirim, and immediately after is found the fall of Da Una, the thirtythird and last on this river.  
Six leagues  below this fall, the Rio Pardo r  ceives on its n. side the river Orelha da Anta, (so called from abounding with ants) ; and four leagues lower down, on the same side, the Orelha da Ouca, from the mouth of which, after 11 leagues of navigation, is found the junction which the river Anhanderyuassu makes from the s. with the Pardo, which, from the passage of Camapuao to this point, completes a s. e. course of 45 leagues in extent. The Anhandery and the Pardo from their confluence, run 16 leagues of navigation wi in one channel, and disembogue in the w. bank of the Parana in lat. about 21°. The  velocity of the current of the Rio Pardo is very irregular ; it may be navigated downward in five or six days, but cannot be ascended in less than 20 or 30, and that by hauling, for the force of the the stream in some places is too great for oars. 
The river Parana is of great breadth and weight of water, and is navigated against its current up to the mouth of the Tiete. In the first three leagues occurs the island of Manuel Homem. Five leagues above this island the Rio Verde falls into the Parana, by a mouth of 42 fathoms, on its w. bank, and at an equal distance above, on the opposite e. side, the river Aguapehy enters, by a mouth apparently above 20 yards wide. Eight leagues above this river, and on the w. side of the Parana, the large river Sucuriu has its mouth, at least 53 fathoms wide, and, after four leagues of navigation further, on the Parana, is found the mouth of the large and interesting river, the Tiete. The distance between the rivers Tiete and Pardo, according to the windings of the Parana, may be estimated at thirty -five leagues ; the direction n. inclining to the e. Passing up the Tiete, in the first three leagues is found the great Salto de Itapura (a great cascade), to avoid which the canoes are dragged 60 fathoms over land. A league above is the difficult fall of Itapuramirim ; another league upwards are the three falls, called Tres Irmaos, and little more than that distance onward, that of Itapuru, half a league long ; two leagues further is the fall of U-aicuritubamirim, and in the upper part of it the small river Sucury enters the Tiete upon its n. bank. One league above it is the fall of Utupiba, a quarter of a league in length. The same distance above is the fall of Araracanguauassu, which is passed with unloaded canoes. Five leagues above this is found the Axaracanguamirim ; one league further, the Arassatuba, and at the same distance, the U-aicurituba, from which, in the space of nine leagues, occur seven falls. Three and a half leagues above the last of them is that of the Escaramunca, so called from the abrupt windings of the river among a thousand rocks and stoppages. Two leagues above this is the large fall of Avanhandava, where the canoes are unloaded, and their cargoes carried half a mile over land, and the canoes hauled the greatest part of the way, to avoid a cataract 16 yards perpendicular. A league and a half above this is the fall of A vanhandavamirim, and very near it, that of the Campo, from which there are 14 leagues of clear navigation to those of the Camboyuvoca, and next to the Tambaumirim and Uassu, both]  

PARAGUAY.  Twithin the compass of two leagues. One league further is the fall of Tambitiririca ; three leagues froui thence, the U-amicanga, and a little more than two leagues upwards, the Jacunpipira enters the Tiete, on the n. side, and has a mouth 15 fathoms broad. A league and a half above this is the Jacuripipiramirim, six leagues from whence is the fall of Congouha, a league in length. For the space of eight leagues from this there are six falls, ofwhichthelastisBanharem. From this it is three leagues and a half to the mouth of the Paraniaba, 38 fathoms broad : it enters the Tiete on the n. ; and the latter river from this point immediately narrows itself to 40 fathoms wide. From the mouth of the Paraniaba there is a navigation of four leagues to the small fall of Ilha, and 14 leagues more, with frequent windings, to that of ltahy, near a populous village, called Jundahy. Six leagues from this is the fall of Pedrenegoa, which is a quarter of a league long ; and half a league above it, the river Sorecaba, which comes from the town of the same name, in lat. 23° 35', empties itself on the s. into the Tiete. Near this town are several mountains, called Guaraceaba, some of which abound with rich oxide of iron, which, on smelting, has proved very good. Upon them grows fine timber for machinery, and wood of every size fit for reducing into carbon. Numerous streams flow from them, which may be employed to great advantage, and their base is washed by the river Campanhes, near the Capivara, both of which empty themselves into the Tiete at a short distance. From the river Sorecaba it is only six leagues to Porto Felix, where all the embarkation is now made to Matto Grosso from St. Paul's, the distance being about 23 leagues from that city. Through this conveyance, salt, iron, ammunition, clothing for the troops, &c. are sent annually by government. Trading parties frequently arrive at St. Paul's from Cuiaba in the month of February, and return in April or May. Resuming our account of the Paraguay, it is to be observed that the Embotetieu enters that river five leagues below the mouth of the Taquari, and on the same side. It is now called Mondego, and was formerly navigated by the traders from St. Paul's, who entered by the Anhanderyuassu, the s. branch of the Pardo. On the n. bank of the Mondego, 20 leagues above its mouth, the Spaniards founded the city of Xerez, which the Paulistas destroyed. Ten leagues above this place, in the mountains that form the upper part of the Embotetieu, there is a tradition that there are rich mines which were discovered  
50 years ago. One league below the mouth of the Mondego there are two high insulated mounts, fronting each other on the Paraguay : at the extremity of the s. declivity of the mount on the w. side, near the bank of the river, is the garrison of New Coimbra, founded in 1775 ; it is the last and southermost Portuguese establishment on the great Paraguay. Eleven leagues to the s. of Coimbra, on the w. side of the Paraguay, is the mouth of Bahia Negra, a large sheet of water of six leagues in extent, being five leagues long from n. to s. : it receives the waters of the wideflooded plains and lands to the s. and w. of the mountains of Albuquerque. At this bay the Portuguese possessions on both banks of the Paraguay terminate. From thence the river continues to lat. 21°, where, on its w. bank, is situated a hill known to the Portuguese by the name of Miguel Jose, crowned with aSpansihfort with four pieces of artillery, called Bourbon. Three leagues above this the little river Guirino falls into the Paraguay on the e. side. Nine leagues to the s. of the above fort, and in lat. 21° 22', are other mountains on both sides the Paraguay, which command this river ; for the e. side is surmounted with a lofty chain, extending to the interior of the country, near which is the sugarloaf mount ; the opposite side is equally mountainous, but not so high or extensive ; and in the middle of the river there is a high rocky island, which, with the mountainous banks on each side, forms two channels of about a musketshot across. This, in case of war between the neighbouring nations, would be a post of the highest importance, as it forms a natural barrier, which would require little fortification to render it an effectual obstacle to invasion. Here terminate those extensive inundations, to which both banks of the Paraguay are subject : they commence at the mouth of the Jauru, and to this point cover an extent of 100 leagues from n. to s. and 40 in breadth at their highest floods, forming an apparent lake, which geographers of former days, as well as some moderns, have termed the Xarayes. This inundation confounds the channel of the great Paraguay with those of its various confluents, in such a manner that, from 20 to 30 leagues above their regular mouths, it is possible, in time of the floods, to navigate across from one to the other, always in deep water, without ever seeing or approaching the banks of the Paraguay. During this wonderful inundation, the high mountains and elevated land which it incloses appear like so many superb islands, and the lower grounds form a labyrinth of lakes,]  PARAGUAY.  
[bays, and pools, many of which remain after the floods have subsided. From the intricacy of these inundated plains, the navigation is rendered impracticable to all who do not unite experience with skill. From this position, (the only barrier on the Paraguay), the banks downward are in general high and firm, particularly the e. or Portuguese side. In lat. 22° 5<>, a considerable river empties itself into it, which the Spaniards, at the demarcation in 1753, would have to be the Corrientes, whereas the heads of this river are 20 leagues n. of the real Corrientes mentioned in the treaty. 
Between the Paraguay and the Parana there runs from n. to s. an extensive chain of mountains, which have the appellation of Amanbay ; they terminate to the s. of the river Iguatimy, forming a ridge running s. and w. called Maracayer. From these mountains spring all the rivers which, from the Taquari 5. enter the Paraguay, and from the same chain also proceed many other rivers, which, taking a contrary direction, flow into the Parana : one of them, and the most s. being the Igoatimy, which has its mouth in lat. 23° 47', a little above the Seven Falls, or the wonderful cataract of the Parana. This cataract is a most sublime spectacle, being distinguished to the eye of the spectator from below by the appearance of six rainbows, and emitting from its fall a constant cloud of vapours, which impregnates the air to a great distance. On the n. side of the Igoatimy, 20 leagues from its mouth, the Portuguese had formerly the fortress of Bauris, which was abandoned in 1777. The Igoatimy has its sources 10 leagues above this place, among high and rugged mountains. The river Xexuy enters the Paraguay on the e. side in lat. 24° IF, twenty leagues below the Ipane, another small river, called the Ipanemirim, intervening. 
This is a summary description of Portugueze Paraguay, to the point where the territory ought (as our tourist observes) to extend ; and such is the situation of this great river, that the abovementioned rivers, which concentrate towards the interior of Brazil, enter it on the e. side ; not one enters it on the w. from the Jauru to the parallel of the Ipane. Many parts of the banks of all those rivers are laid under water at the time of the floods, and the plains are covered to a considerable depth. 
A river of such vast size as the Paraguay, in a temperate and salubrious climate, abounding with fish, bordered by extensive plains and high mountains, intersected by so many rivers, bays,  lakes, and forests, must naturally have drawn many of the Indian nations to inhabit its banks : but, immediately after the discovery of the new continent, the incursions of the Paulistas and Spaniards seem to have dispersed and destroyed the numerous tribes : the Jesuits transplanted many thousands to their settlements on the Uraguay and Parana. Other nations fled from the avarice of the new settlers to countries less favoured, but more secure by reason of their distance, and the difficulty of approach. This emigration of one nation to districts occupied by another, became the fruitful source of inveterate and sanguinary wars among them, which tended to reduce their numbers. There are, however, still some Indians left on the borders of the Paraguay, among whom the Guay cuius, or Cavalier Indians, are principally distinguished for valour. They occupy the lands from the river Taquari, extending s. along all the rivers that enter the Paraguay on the e. side, as far as the river Ipane, and in like manner, on the opposite bank, from the mountains of Albuquerque downwards. They have made war repeatedly on the Spaniards and Portuguese, without ever beingsubdued. They are armed with lances of extraordinary length, bows, arrows, &c. They make long incursions on horseback into the neighbouring territories ; they procure horses in exchange for stout cotton cloaks, called ponchos, which they manufacture. There are other Indian nations inhabiting these large tracts, some of whom have intermixed both with the Portuguese and Spaniards, there being few of the latter on any part of the confines without some traces of Indian physiognomy. 
From the river Xexuy, downwards, the Paraguay takes its general course s. for 32 leagues to the city of Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay, and the residence of its governor. This city is situated on an obtuse angle made by the e. bank of the river ; the population is by no means trifling, and there are some Portuguese among the inhabitants. The government is of vast extent, and its total population is given by different authorities at from 97,000 to 120,000"souls. The land is fertile, and contains many rich farms : its principal product is the matte, which is exported to Tucuman and Buenos Ayres, from whence it is sent to various parts of the Spanish dominions, along the coast of Chile and Peru, being a general article of consumption among all ranks of people. Its other products are hides, tobacco, and sugar. From Buenos Ayres large boats arrive at the city of Asuncion, after two or]  three months passage ; the only difficulty in navigating is the great weight of the waters of the PaVaouay, which flow with great rapidity : but this disadvantage is lessened by favourable winds, which blow the greater part of the year from the s. Six leagues below Asuncion, on the w. side of the Paraguay, the river Pilcomayo enters that river by its first mouth ; its second is 14 or 16 leagues lower. In this space some other smaller rivers enter on the e. side, and amongst them the Tibiquari, on an arm of which, 20 leagues s. e. from Asuncion, is Villa Rica, a large Spanish town, with much property in cattle on its extensive plains. The river Veimecho enters the w. side of the Paraguay, in lat. 26° 45'. On a remote upper branch of this river is the town of Salto, near an accessible fall : it is an important point to the Spaniards who are transporting their goods from Buenos Ayres, Tucuman, &c. to Upper Peru.]

[This captainship was bestowed by John III. on the celebrated historian De Bauos ; but he was compelled to restore it to the government after having nearly ruined himself by his unsuccessful attempts to colonize it.] 
Paraiba, the capital, is of the same name, a city and head of the bishopric, called also City de Federico and Nuestra Sefiora de las Nieves. It is situate opposite the fort of Tamaraca, at the s. mouth and shore of the river of its name; is large, well peopled, mercantile, and rich. The buildings are handsome, particularly the cathedralchurch, which is magnificent. It is defended by three forts; two situate on islands, with the names of San Antonio and La Restinga, and the third on the point of Santa Catalina. It enjoys a fine healthy air and good climate. The Dutch, commanded by Captains Longk and Wardenburg, took it in 1635, but it was afterwards recovered by the Portuguese, being under the dominion of the kings of Spain. 
[The above capital was built at the expence of the king. It stands near the river Paraiba, at the mouth of which is the harbour. A handsome customhouse has been erected near it, and a pentagonal fort, named St. Catherine, which defends the entrance into this harbour. Seven or eight ships of about 250 tons burden used annually to enter this port from the mothercountry, loaded with different articles for the use of the colony. Their homeward bound cargoes consisted chiefly of sugar, more of which is raised in the n. captainships than in those of the s. ; especially since the discovery of the goto mines, which have rendered the inhabitants of these last districts more negligent respecting the improvement of their plantations. There are 21' sugar houses in this province, and the sugar manufactured in them is said to be superior to any other in Brazil. 
Besides sugar, they also export dying woods, several sorts of drugs, and other valuable commodities, and it is generally allowed that these n. captainships are the most populous, and the inhabitants in very easy circumstances, though no mines have yet been wrought in these parts. The capital is computed to contain nearly 4000 souls, and the province about 20,000.] In lat. 6° 57' 30" *. Long. 35° 10' 30" w.

==[[Paramaribo|PARAMARIBO]]==, a city of the Dutch, in the part which they possess in Guayana ; the capital of the colony of Surinam ; situate on the w. side pf the river, 10 miles from the sea, upon a sandy rock, which causes the streets to be very easy to the tread. It has this name from a settlement of Indians, which it formerly was. In the hot seasons the sand becomes so burning as to penetrate the soles of the shoes and blister the feet. The houses, which amount to the number of BOO, are very regularly built, and nearly all of  them without windows, on account of the heat ; and attached to them are pleasant gardens. To about three feet in height thej are of brick, and upwards of wood, with the exception of the houses of the governor and commandant, which are of stone, although the former are sumptuous. In all the streets there is before the houses an orangegrove, which buds twice a year. The cityhouse is in a handsome spot, and surrounded also by orangetrees; and here is the slavemarket. It was, indeed, at first used as a buryingground, but from fear of any infection from the bodies, they were carried afterwards to the extreme part of the town, and interred in a rising ground. Divine service is performed here every Sunday, in Dutch in the morning, and after midday in French, there being two ministers for the former and one for the latter of these duties. Although a poor person is rarely seen here, there is a house for the reception of orphans, and of such as from age are incapacitated for labour, and thus the streets are entirely free of beggars. Here is a superb Lutheran church, situate on the shore of the river, where a sermon is preached every Sunday, morning and evening ; also two synagogues of Portuguese and German Jews, that of the former being the best. 
The plaza, or place of arms, is garrisoned by two battalions of infantry, and these with the artillerymen form a body 1200 strong, whose pay is furnished one half by the society of the Jesuits, and the other half by the inhabitants of the colony : also for them is provided an hospital, with physicians, surgeon, drugs, &c. Besides this troop the inhabitants are formed into three companies of militia, who are obliged to take up arms at command; and in the plantations on the banks of the river are as many more companies, who at the first signal gun are to repair armed to the city. 
The governor of this colony formerly settled all the differences without appeal, but a council was afterwards established, composed of 13 persons, over which the governor is president ; nor can any one aspire to be of this council, except he have great influence in the country.

Some very lofty mountains of the cordillera of the Andes; the heights of which are exceeding, but vary so much that the skirts of some rest upon the tops of others. They are the whole year round covered with snow, which is become hardened by time, so as to cause the temperature to be cold in the extreme, and to render them totally uninhabitable. The most celebrated of these mountains are in the kingdom of Quito ; and the lower parts of them are covered with a kind of straw like esparto (matweed), although less harsh, which grows in such abundance, and to such an height, Is to be in some parts half a yard and in others threequarters. Amongst this grows a tree, called quinual, of a strong wood and small dark green leaf, and rough to the touch ; also a plant, peculiar to the climate, called by the Indians pah de lu% (tree of light), the which is about three feet high, grows in one perpendicular stem till the upper part, where it shoots some small branches, these also producing others, on each of which sprout two leaves. This plant being cut near the root and lighted when green, serves the Indians as a candle, and burns like one till the whole of the stick is consumed. There also grows in these paramos the achupalla, composed of stalks, like those of the savila, the trunk of which, when tender, serves for the Indians as salad, like that of the palmito. The canchalagua and the contrayerva, well known for their virtues, are also found here, as is the puchugchu, which is a sort of bread formed of an herb, the leaves of which are round and of the figure of the muskflower, and which unite and knit themselves together with such force as to form a body of two feet in diameter, so hard as to resist the weight of a man. 
Notwithstanding the severity of the climate of the Paramos, there are not wanting animals to breed upon them, such as deer and foxes ; and birds, as partridges and condors, which are birds of prey, and of a magnitude above any of the feathered race ; and to them are these mountains peculiar, for they never leave them but in search of prey, when they fly into the valleys to pounce upon the lambs, which they carry up with their tallons in the air. The Indians have a method of catching them by anointing a concealed net with certain herbs which stupifies them ; but they are generally aware of the mischief, and betake themselves to flight. Here is also a bird which they call the zumbador, which seldom allows itself to be seen though continually heard; and another, to which they give the name of cancion, the note of which is like the handurrw.

It rises in the province of Minas Geraes to the s. of the city of Va. da. S.

At the distance of 125 leagues from its mouth it has two falls which impede its navigation, so that the boats are obliged to be carried for some little distance by land. The whole of that extent of its course s. from the river Paranape to 27° or 28°, is called Guayra. The country is of a fine temperature and very fertile, and populous in former times; and in some valleys towards the e. from the Uruguay, the territory of which they called Tape, dwelt some Indians, of whom are descended those of the missions of the present day, and lately converted. Those of the river Guayra call themselves Guaranis, and the others Tapes, being as it were a colony of the former. All of them spoke, and still speak, the same idiom, which is the Guarani, and with greater or less purity, the other nations of the &uaicurus, the Chiriguailos, &c. 
This country was discovered by Alvar JNunez Cabeza de Vaca, in 1541, he being governor of Paraguay ; and he took possession of it in the name of the king, calling it the province of Yera, . The inhabitants were laborious, lived in settle-  ments, sowed maize twice a yucas or mandioca, bred fowl  year, cultivated and eat human flesh, not only of their own prisoners, for they were very warlike, but even that of their own 
Two monks of the order of San Francisco, called Fr. Bernardo de Armenta, and Fr. Alonso Lebron, who accompanied the governor in his voyage, were the first who gave these Indians the first insight into religion. Some years afterwards others of their order came, and obtained great fruit by their labours ; but he that laboured most, and who stayed amongst them 50 years, was the venerable Fr. Luis de Bolanos, companion of San Francisco Solano, who, accompanied by many other religious, erected many chapels or churches in Guayra, establishing six reductions, and uniting the Indians in settlements h 2  PARANA.  and in large and convenient parts on the shores of the rivers Ibajiba, Paranape, and Pirapo, and, for their instruction in their catechism, he made himself master of the Guarani tongue, many of his orations in this language having been since printed by the Jesuits. 
This great missionary, bent down with years and infirmities, and finding it impossible for him longer to fulfil his wonted duties, went with gladness to welcome the arrival of some Jesuits, entrusting them with his flock ; but such was the veneration of the Indians for their old masters, that they were with difficulty persuaded by the venerable Franciscan to accept of the offices of the new comers ; he at last, however, persuaded them, by assuring them that the Jesuits were their brothers, and that the only difference between the one and the other was the dress. The Jesuits followed up the advantages of their predecessors, and founded some fresh settlements or doctrinal establishments in 1614. But the Mamelucos Paulistas of Brazil made various irruptions against those settlements, in order to entrap prisoners, which they might carry to sell to work in the mines of that kingdom and at the sugar engines ; nor did they carry thither less, at different times, than 100,000 souls ; and on this account the missionaries found themselves under the necessity of withdrawing the settlements to a spot where they now stand ; where, being still infested, a permission was obtained from his majesty for these Indians to carry firearms for their defence, in 1639, although they were not brought into action till some time after, when, being well instructed by the Jesuits, they succeeded in completely routing their enemies. 
These settlements are nearer to Paraguay and Buenos Ay res than they were formerly, and of the 30, which was their number, 13 belong to the bishopric of the former, and the 17 others to the latter : the former were also of the temporal government of that province till 1726, when the king ordered that they should all be dependent on the government of Buenos Ayres. They are of the following names : 
San Ignacio Guazu, Santa Rosa, 
San Cosme, Candelaria, 
Santa Ana,  
Itapua, 
La Trinidad, 
Jesus, 
Santiago, 
NuestraSenora deFe, Of the which eight are to the s. of Parana, and the five others to the n. These last were ceded by the king to the crown of Portugal in 1755, in

These settlements contain 41,000 souls, who cultivate the same fruits as those of Paraguay, but in greater abundance, namely wheat, maize, sugar, herb of Paraguay, tobacco, cotton, seeds, fruit and gardenherbs, besides the cutting of some trees to make planks. 
The territory abounds in such large and fine pastures that when the Jesuits quitted the country, there were found in the 30 settlements no less than 769,589 horses, 13,905 mules, and 271,537 heads of sheep. The government, arts, and manufactures established here by the same missionaries, has for many years been a problem which could not be solved : whether, in fact, all this should prove, as some will have it, the perfection of a republic, or, as others, that it should be looked upon as a tyrannical despotism eager only for its own interests. More on this subject may be seen in the " Christianisnio felice" of Muratori, the Italian, and in the general collection of the documents for the extermination of the Jesuits, printed by order of the government. 
In this province there is a constant tradition that the evangelist and apostle St. Thomas preached here. Dr. Xarque, dean of Albarracin, lays it down in his own mind as a fact, nor did he dwell a short time in the country. Besides this, there is in a certain road leading from Brazil, in the midst of unfrequented woods, a kind of bower or avenue, indisputably the work of art, which the Indians have always called the path of St. Thomas; also in the province of Paraguay is to be seen a cave, not a work of nature but of art, the which is seven yards long and proportionably wide, with a floor level and plain, and a roof composed of one flat stone, perfectly free from any inequalities of surface ; this cave is in a lofty mountain, and both the mountain and the cave bear the name of St, Thomas ; and it is there thought that the saint used to make the same cave his abode, and that he there used to preach to the Indians of those valleys. Here also is found an hollow rock which is difficult of entrance, but in which is found the prints of feet and hands, the same phenomena existing in other parts of the coast of Paraguay ; and all agree in asserting that they are of that apostle, and that he first taught them the use of the herb of Paraguay. This at least cannot be doubted but that they knew the use of it before the arrival of the Spaniards.  The Indians of Brazil concur with this tradition and assure us that the apOstle St. Thomas landed at the port of Todos Santos, opposite the bar of San Vincente. Now, if to all these assertions we take into consideration the information given by the Indians to the conquerors of Peru, respecting the orgin of the cross of the settlement of Carabuco in the province of Omasuyos ; if we consider the stone which was found in the curacy of Ayaviri, of the province of Yauyos ; the sions at Caxamarca, and the vestiges of our religion found in a cave near Tarija, it may be inferred that it is most probable that St. Thomas did actually preach the gospel in these countries. 
[But to return to the description of the Parana. This great river (observes the traveller Mawe), which the first discoverers considered as the chief, on account of its abundant waters, unites with the e. side of the Paraguay in lat. 27° 16' ; and their united streams take the name of the Rio de la Plata, which originated in the following circumstance. Martim de Jousa, the first donatory of the captainship of St. Vicente, furnished Alexo Garcia with an adequate escort to explore the hitherto untrodden wilds to the w. of the extensive coast of Brazil. This intrepid Portuguese, by the route of the Tiete, reached the Paraguay, which he crossed, and penetrated considerably into the interior, from whence he returned, it is said, loaded with silver, and some gold ; but he halted on the Paraguay, and waited for the coming of his son, a youth of tender years, with some of his people, whilst he sent forward an account of the discovery. He was surprised by a body of Indians, who killed him, took his son prisoner, and carried off all his riches ; the year following, 60 Portuguese, who were sent in search of Garcia, shared the same fate. The Spaniards who first settled on this river, seeing so much silver amongst these Indians, and supposing it to be the produce of the country, called the river La Plata. The Parana derives its principal sources from the w. side of the mountains of Mantiqueira, 25 leagues w. of the town of Paraty. For further descriptions connected with this article, see Paraguay.]

Here are plantains, pines, and various fruits in abundance ; but the greatest attraction of this spot is a certain bower, whither the Indians come to shelter themselves from the heat, and occasionally to amuse themselves, observing, from that eminence, the vessels passing along the river, and which are discernible at an immense distance.

Pari, another, a small river of the' province and government of Guayana or Nueva Andalucia, one of those which enters the Orinoco by the e. side. 

PARI A, a province and corregimiento of the kingdom of Peru, in the archbishopric of Charcas ; bounded n. by the provinces of Pacages, n. e. by the jurisdiction of the town of Oruro, e. and s. e. by that of Porco, s. w. by that of Lipes, and w. by that of Garangas. It is of a cold temperature, and the vegetable productions are those peculiar to the sierra; such as papas, bark, barley, &c. It has large breeds of smaller cattle, some also of larger, and of llamas, vicunas, and huanacos. Here are salt mines, and a lake from which much is extracted ; also various streams of warm water. 
The corregidors of Oruro being alcaldes mayores of the mines of the district of Veinte Leguas and Paria, the capital of this province, and the settlement of Sepulturas, being included in the same limits ; they appropriated to themselves, some years since, some silver mines of the Cordillera of Condocondo, and some gold mines, of which many have filled with water, and others are not worked from the great expence. In this province runs a large river from the province of Pacages, which is called the Desaguadero, takingits source in the great lake Titicaca or Chucuito ; and which being passed in various parts in rafts made of tortora or reed, runs s. e. and forms a lake of three to four leagues long and two wide, in which breeds a fish, called by some suches, and by others bagres. 
This river, as being very abundant, and the lake continuing always at one height, it caused a suspicion that its waters had a subterraneous vent ; and in fact it is found to have a whirlpool, over which some old rafts being permitted to float, where, after giving two or three turns, sucked down. The water is thought to find itself a passage into the sea under the cordillera, and through the shore, close to the port of Iqueique. In 1748 its waters increased to an immense height, and it was concluded that some raft had blocked up its subterraneous passage ; a circumstance most likely, since, after a time, they subsided to their ordinary state. One part of this province is inundated in the rainy seasons for many leagues.  The inhabitants, who amount to 10,000, make cheeses of sheep's milk, much esteemed in other provinces for their delicacy. Its corregidor used to have a repartimiento of 50,200 dollars^ and paid an alcavala of 401 dollars yearly: the capital is the town of the same name. 
[The natives of this province, as well as those of Guayana and Debaiba, were originally very zealous in their worship of the devil and idols, to whom they sacrificed men, and then eat the'm; when their gods were angry, they punished themselves with fasting. Their priests were stoned or burned, if they married against their vow of chastity. They believed in rewards and punishments after this life. The spot in the moon they held to be a man imprisoned there for incest with his sister. They fed yearly the departed souls with maize and wine. They held the souls of great men only, and such as were buried with them, immortal. Their great men's funeral pomps were celebrated yearly with much lamentations, drinking, and bestial ceremonies, both men and women casting aside all modesty. These subjects are further treated off by the authors, P. Martyr, Gomara, Linschoten, Cieza, &c] 
Paria, the lake of which we have above spoken, which receives the waters of the river by a channel of 80 fathoms. These waters are of very bad quality, but abound in excellent fish, and are thought, with great reason, to have a subterraneous vent. 
Paria, a province. See Anoalucia. 
Paria, a gulf, between the coast of the province of Ciimana to the s. s. w. and w. n. w. and the island Trinidad to the n. e. and s. e. terminating by the n. at the cape of Las Salinas and that of San Joseph, and by the c. at the cape or point of Blanquizales ; its entrance at the former part being by the mouth of the Drago or Dragon, at the latter by the point of Galera. Its extent from e. to w. is 88 miles, and from n. to s. 50, and off the coast of the island of Trinidad is very good anchorage. 
[This gulf is called by the Spaniards Triste (Sad), but as the whole of the coast of Tiera Firme which surrounds the gulf goes by the name of Paria, the English and the French geographers have given that name to the gulf itself. What these two latter nations mean by the gulf Sad, is a gulf which lies between cape Coderas and point Hicacos. 
From the two lands to the n. of this gulf, jut out two points, between which are three islands, which are nearly e. and w. of each other, and consequently close the gulf to the n. excepting four channels left between the islands called Dra-  gon's mouths. The largest of these channels, beino- 6 miles broad, is that to the w. between the point Pena of Cumana, and the island named Chacachacares. There are several rocks above water in the channel lyingclose to the point, and one hidden rock two cables length from the island. . ' 1 . 
Between this island and the next, which is called Navios, there is a second channel named Ship Channel (des vaisseaux,) which, as it runs from n. to n. e. is very good for vessels entering the gulf, but very bad for going out. The third channel is formed by the preceding island, and that which lies next to the e. named Monos ; it is called de Huevos, or Channel of Eggs. It runs from n. n. e. to *. s. e. ; it is, like the preceding, better for entering than leaving the gulf. The fourth channel is formed by the preceding island Monas, and the w. n. w. point of Trinidad, and is called Apes Mouth. It is narrow and dangerous, on account of a rock in the middle of the passage. The small vessels that enter by this passage always pass between the rock and Trinidad. 
This gulf forms one of the finest ports in the world ; its size and extent has been already mentioned ; it has in every part good anchorage, the bottom being mud, except by Camana, where there are some sands and banks, and the water is shallow. On the s. some of the mouths of the Orinoco fall into the gulf in many branches, and with great velocity. It is probable that the Orinoco originally may have separated the island of Trinidad from the main land, and have also produced the four channels which are above described. The current is certainly always running out, and for which reason, it is impossible for ships to enter if the winds are not favourable and sufficiently strong. 
On the coast of Paria there are several ports and roadsteads, which render the communication with Trinidad very easy.]

==[[Parime|PARIME]]==, an immense lake of the province of Dorado, being the deposit of the waters of infinite rivers, some of which are very large, which enter by a very wide arm of the river Branco and others. Some modern authors would have it, that this lake is merely fabulous and imaginary ; but, according to the late advices, it is said to be real and existing. Its extent is not known, but it varies according to its different parts : it is of a square figure, and the greater part of the travellers allow it to be 82 leagues long from e. to w* so as to resemble a little sea, its waters even being salt. From the mountains to the w. of it, flow down many rivers, all of which run into it, and on the n. side it has a channel by which it runs out into the river Paraba. In the midst of it are many islands, and in the mountains dwell many nations of infidel Indians, supposed to be in possession of that beautiful country the Dorado, but which, from the solicitude it has caused, has been fatal to so many. 
On the n. n. e. the river Cuyuni rises from this lake, and laves the territory of the Dutch colonies, and afterwards unites itself with the Esequii bo; on the s. rises the Paranapitinga or Yaguapira, which means white water, the which enters the Maranan by three mouths by the n. part, and was discovered in 1745. Another, river, also of the same name as the lake, issues from it. 
[It is now discovered beyond all question, and according to the latest maps and manuscript drawings of that country, that this lake is nothing but an overflow of the head branches of the, Branco, in the valley of Parimo.] i  PAR  
The abovenamed river, which is very large, runs continually s. collecting the waters of several other rivers, and, making various turns, enters the Neoro by four mouths or arms, called Dara, Podaviri, Varaca, and the Principal mouth.

Its length from n. e. to s. w. is 35 leagues, and its width 12 by the opposite rhomb, though rather irregular, as are all the provinces of the sierra. Such being its situation, it is extremely cold, with exception of some ravines, where the temperature is so benign that pears, and other kinds of fruits, except chirimoyas, will otow all the year round, and this more particularly in the settlement of Pause, and in some others, where they grow wheat, beans, and barley in abundance. Here are breeds of cattle, particularly of the lanigerous sort, from the fineness and plenty of the pasture. They weave here some cloth, which they call chuspas, cumbes, and lliellas of beautiful fabric, for which purpose they cultivate a sort of grain which they call the magno. In the mountains are found many huanacos, which are used in droves for carryinglight burthens. In the curacy of Pullo, are various mines of gold, which they dress with quicksilver ; but the quality of that metal is uncertain, and the emolument it produces is not easily calculated ; but it ought not to be small, as a very considerable proportion of labourers and traders find employment by it. 
There are here salt mines, various streams of warm medicinal waters, and a lake of seven leagues long and one wide, on which breeds a kind of white bird, whose name, in the language of the country, is panuira, and it is from a corruption of this word, and the adjunct cucha, which signifies lake, that we have parinacocha. Many of the inhabitants, as well Indians as Mustees, are engaged in the occupation of drovers, and carry from the province of Cumana to that of Cuzco and other parts, wine, brandy, aji, olives, dried  fish, and prawns ; taking in exchange dried beef, tallow, papas, chuno, and clothes. The inhabitants, who are divided into 30 settlements, should amount to about 11,300. The corregidor used to have a repartimiento of 86,400 dollars, and it paid an alcavala of 691 dollars annually.

It divides New Hampshire from York county in the district of Maine, and is called Salmon Fall river, from its head to the lower falls at Berwick, where it assumes the name of Newichawannock, which it bears till it meets with Cochecho river,  PAS  which comes from Dover, when both run together in one channel to Hilton's point, where the w. branch meets it : from this junction to the sea the river is so rapid that it never freezes ; the distance is seven miles, and the course generally from s. to s. e. The w. branch is formed by Swamscot river, which comes from Exeter, Winnicot river, which comes„through Greenland, and Lamprey river, which divides Newmarket from Durham ; these empty into a bay four miles wide, called the Great Bay. The water, in its further progress, is contracted into a lesser bay, and then it receives Oyster river, which runs through Durham, and Back river, which comes from Dover, and at length meets with the main stream at Hilton's point. The tide rises into all these bays, and branches as far as the lower falls in each river, and forms a most rapid current, especially at the season of the freshets, when the ebb continues about two hours longer than the flood ; and were it not for the numerous eddies, formed by the indentings of the shore, the ferries would then be impassable. 
At the lower falls in the several branches of the river are landingplaces, whence lumber and other country produce is transported, and vessels or boats from below discharge their lading ; so that in each river there is a convenient trading place not more than 12 or 15 miles distant from Portsmouth, with which there is constant communication by every tide. Thus the river, from its form and the situation of its branches, is extremely favourable to the purposes of navigation and commerce.

Paso, another settlement and garrison, with the additional title Del Norte, in the Nuevo Reyno de Vizcaya of N. America ; founded to restrain the infidel Indians. One hundred and seventyfive leagues n. of the capital, Durango. 
[This presidio, or military post, on the right bank of the Rio del Norte, is separated (says Humboldt) from the town of Santa Fe by an uncultivated country of more than 300 miles in length. We must not confound this place, which some manuscript maps in the archives of Mexico consider as a dependance of New Biscay, with the Presidio del Norte, or De las Juntas, situated further to the 5. at the s. side of the mouth of the Rio Conchos. Travellers stop at the Paso del Norte to lay in the necessary provisions for continuing their route to Santa Fe. The environs of the Paso are delicious, and resemble the finest parts of Andalucia. The fields are cultivated with maize and wheat ; and the vineyards produce such excellent sweet wines that they are even preferred to the wines of Parras in New Biscay. The gardens contain in abundance all the fruits of Europe, figs, peaches, apples, and pears. As the country is very dry, a canal of irrigation brings the water of the- Rio del Norte to the Paso. It is with difficulty that the inhabitants of the presidio can keep up the dam, which forces the waters of the rivers when they are very low to enter into the canal (azequia). During the great swells of the Rio del Norte, the strength of the current destroys this dam almost every year in the months of May and June. The manner of restoring and strengthening the dam is very ingenious. The inhabitants form baskets of stakes, connected together by branches of trees, and filled with earth and stones. These gabions (cestones) are abandoned to the force of the current, which, in its   PAS eddies, disposes them in the point where the canal separates from the river.] ; ■.. • •< . "

==[[Pasquaro|PASQUARO|Utzila]]==, the capital of the province and bishopric of Mechoacan in Nueva Espana, once the court of the king Calzontzi. It is of a cold and moist temperature." The principal buildings are not without elegance, and it is situate, in a delightful country, as being just at the entrance of the sierra, surrounded by mountains covered with fine foliage ; also in the gardens, which it has in its Uanuras, are abundance of fruits and flowers of different kinds. Towards the n. part is a great lake, 12 leagues in circumference, and so abounding in excellent fish as not only to provide this city but also that of Valladolid and other settlements ; great portions also being at times sent to Mexico, where  

PAS  they are sold as great dainties. In the middle of this lake are some small islands, inhabited by Indians living in huts, who make a daily trade by the fish they catch in their canoes. 
The plain on which the city stands being surrounded with rising grounds, there is an entrance by a wide causeway entirely of stone, and the first building which you discover on the e. side is a chapel, in which is venerated the image of Christ crucified ; which spot they call the Humilladero (place of humiliation), since here it was that the Indians surrendered themselves to the Spaniards. The parishchurch, which was first began to be erected where it now stands, by the first bishop, but which, from not being concluded, was removed to Valladolid, is as to what exists of it, a sumptuous edifice. One nave only is finished out of the five which should render it complete ; but this is the admiration of architects, who confess that were it finished according to the design, it would be unrivalled by any building in America. In this church are two winding staircases made of stone, and which are so nicely constructed that it is a common amusement for the Indians to seat themselves at the top and let them slip round and round to the bottom. The other staircase is a lofty pillar, with two fans leading different ways, so that two persons may descend out of different doors, and without seeing each other. 
This city has the convents of the religious orders of San Francisco, San Agustin, San Juan de Dios, a college which belonged to the Jesuits, and which is the second that was founded in Nueva Espana after that of Mexico, its general being Francisco de Borja, who sent to it one of the images of Santa Maria of Rome. In this college are interred Don Vasco de Quiroga, second bishop of that diocess, and the venerable brother Pedro Calzontzi, nephew of the king of the province, who, taking the habit of the Jesuits, lived a holy life in the profession of schoolmaster, and died by an epidemic disorder which he caught in the discharge of his duties, and whilst assisting the sick. Here is also another sumptuous temple, dedicated to Maria Santisima, with the title of La Salud, destined as a monastery for the nuns of Santa Catalina. In one of the wards of the city is venerated a miraculous effigy of Santo Christo de Tupataro, found by an Indian in 1748, in the heart of a tree which he was cutting down, with the cross, nails, and other insignia, perfectly wrought. 
The population of this city is composed of 500  PAS  families of Spaniards, Mustees, and Mulattoes, and of 2000 Indians, who occupy themselves in the commerce and labour of the copper mines in the vicinity of the city, as also in making sugar, and in selling the merchandise of the country.

[The town of Pasquaro seems for nothing more notable than for containing the ashes of a man, whose memory, after a lapse of two centuries  and a half, is still venerated by the Indians, the famous Vasco de Quiroga, alluded to by our author, and who died in 1556 at the village of Uruapa. This zealous prelate, whom the indigenous still call their father ( Tata don Vasco), was more successful in his endeavours to protect the unfortunate inhabitants of Mexico than the virtuous bishop of Chiapa, Bartholome de las Casas. Quiroga became in an especial manner the benefactor of the Tarasc Indians, whose industry he encouraged. He prescribed one particular branch of commerce to each Indian village. These useful institutions are in a great measure preserved to this day. The height of Pascuaro is 2200 metres (or 7217 feet). Its present population 6000.]

(==[[Tassamaquoddy|TASSAMAQUODDY]]==, a bay and river, near which is the division line between the British province of New Brunswick and the United States of America. The island of Campo Bello, in the N. Atlantic ocean, is at the middle or w. passage of the bay, in lat. 45° n. and long. 66° 52' w. The distance of Cross Isle, Machias, to W. Passamaquoddy head is nine leagues n. e. by e. and from the head over the bar to Allen's Isle n. n. w. two leagues. When you come from the 5. w. and are bound into W. Passamaquoddy, you must give the Seal Rocks a birth of three quarters of a mile before you haul in from the harbour, as there is a whirlpool to the e. of them. The bay is about a league from this point. It is high water here at the full and change of the moon, about the same time as at Boston. There are three rivers which fall into this bay ; the largest is called by the modern Indians, the Scoodick ; but by De Mons and Champlaine, Etchemins. Its main river, and the c rivers is but three miles. See New Brunswick. The mouth of Passamaquoddy river has 25 fathoms water. The following official document consists of the joint address of his Majesty's council and the house of representatives of the province of New Brunswick, in general assembly, respecting the islands in Passamaquoddy Bay, which had been claimed by the Americans, and gives a just idea of their importance to the British government. 
' Having long entertained a confident hope, that the possession of Moose island, Dudley island, and Frederic island, in Passamaquoddy Bay, usurped by the state of Massachusetts, would never be sanctioned by an act, or avowed acquiescence on the part of his Majesty's government ; but that his Majesty's indisputable right to these islands would in due time be effectually asserted ; it is with very great concern that we now find, from a passage in a letter from Mr. Merry to your honour, stating the communications made to him by Mr. Madison, the American secretary of state, on the subject of these islands, that the United States do actually consider their present 

VOL. IV.  source is near Penobscot ingplace between the two  possession as having been so sanctioned ; and that they are prepared to construe his Majesty's forbearance in his behalf, as having already warranted their claim of an entire right to these islands. 
' In the letter above referred to, Mr. Merry states, " that the American minister observed to him, that since his Majesty's government have allowed the United States to remain in possession of the abovementioned islands, the waters which surround them, to the distance to which the jurisdiction of any territory is usually understood to extend, ought equally to be considered as American ; and added, that although he could not properly refer, on this occasion, to the convention between his Majesty and the United States, concluded in London, on the 12th of May, 1803, because it had not been ratified, nevertheless, by that convention, the islands in question were declared to belong to the United States ; an arrangement which would probably be confirmed whenever the matter of the boundary line between the two territories should again be brought into discussion ; the more so, because it was not the article respecting the e. boundary on the side of New Brunswick which occasioned the convention to remain unratified." 
' As a hope may be entertained that the convention referred to by Mr. Madison respecting these islands may not yet be ratified, we request your honour to transmit to his Majesty's ministers this our joint address, on a subject of such importance to his Majesty's government, and the rights and interests of his faithful -subjects in this province. 
' After the full discussion of the question of right to these islands, in the correspondence between his Majesty's ministers and his excellency the lieutenantgovernor of this province, on former occasions, particularly his excellency's dispatch to his Grace the Duke of Portland, dated 5th August, 1799, and the letters and documents therein mentioned, it may be thought superfluous to do more than generally to refer to those papers on the present occasion. We trust, however, that the magnitude of the object will justify our attempt to bring within a small compass the result of those discussions, adding thereto some further observations which more immediately press upon our attention, and which we hope will merit the consideration of his Majesty's ministers. 
' That part of the second article of the treaty of peace between his Majesty and the United States which respects the present question is expressed as follows : " East, by a line to be drawn along] j»^ii  PASSAMAQUODDY.  
[the middle of the river St. Croix, from its mouth in the Bay of Fundy, to its source, &c. comprehending all islands within 20 leagues of any part of the shores of the United States, and lying between lines to be drawn due e. from the point where the aforesaid boundaries between Nova Scotia on the one part, and E. Florida on the other part, shall respectively touch the Bay of Fundy, and the Atlantic Ocean, excepting such islands as now are, or heretofore have been, within the limits of the said province of Nova Scotia." 
' The islands hereby granted are evidently such, and such only, as are within 20 leagues of the coast, and also lie between those parallels of latitudes by which the shores of the ceded country are limited at their n. and s. extremeties. Hence all islands, not with those parallels, however near they may be to the shore, are certainly excluded from the grant : and of those which are within the parallels, all such as then were, or ever had been, within the limits of N.ova Scotia, are also excluded. From the treaty of peace, therefore, the United States can derive no shadow of claim to the islands in question ; and his Majesty's original right to them remains entire and incontestible. 
1 For, we believe, it has never been controverted, even by the American government, that these islands always before the treaty of peace, were comprehended within the limits, and constituted a part of the province of Nova Scotia, which it was the obvious intention of the treaty to reserve to his Majesty, by its utmost limits ; a reference to the original boundaries of the province in Sir William Alexander's patent, and to the description of the boundaries in all the commissions to his Majesty's governors of the province and the actual grant of two of these islands to Francis Bernard, and others, by letters patent under the seal of the province of Nova Scotia, bearing date the 30th October, 1765, place this fact beyond all dispute. 
' These islands, at the time when the province of New Brunswick was erected in the year 1784, were all possessed and inhabited by his Majesty's subjects ; they were, by an act of the general assembly of the province, passed in January 1786, for the purpose of dividing the several countries into towns and parishes, expressly made a part of the parish of W. Isles, in the county of Charlotte ; and their inhabitants yielded obedience to the laws of the province, in attending to the several duties which they were called upon to perform •by the courts and magistrates established and  appointed in that county ; and we cannot but consider it as a matter of serious regret, that the possession of these islands, shortly afterwards usurped by the State of Massachusetts, and hitherto continued, has given rise to a claim of territorial right, on the part of that state, founded merely upon that possession. 
' We now beg leave briefly to hint at some of the mischiefs and inconveniences which have resulted from this continued usurpation. Very large quantities of lumber, furnished from the neighbouring parts of the province, are purchased by the American subjects, and carried to these islands for exportation ; which lumber is paid for with prohibited articles from the United States; and they in the same manner engross almost the whole of the produce of the fisheries among these islands, which is also paid for in the same manner ; and thus we sustain a double injury. The W. India islands are, in a great measure, precluded from receiving their supplies of fish and lumber in British bottoms ; and large quantities of contraband goods are introduced into this province, to the great injury of the commercial interests of Great Britain, as well as of the fair merchants and traders residing here. 
' Their situation enables the inhabitants of these islands to engross a very great proportion of the plaster trade from this and the neighbouring province of Nova Scotia, which is now become of great magnitude and extent, whereby his Majesty's subjects are deprived of a very highly valuable carrying trade in this article. 
' These islands are become places of refuge for insolent debtors, and disorderly persons of every description, particularly of deserters from his Majesty's service : all attempts to recover whom are insolently resisted. 
' By the possession of these islands, great facility is given to the conveyance, in small vessels, of contraband articles of every description to various parts of this province and Nova Scotia ; so that the fair British merchant can have no equal competition with these illicit traders, even in the sale of British and W. Indian goods. 
' Whereas, on the contrary, if these islands were in the possession of his Majesty's subjects, very large quantities of fish and lumber would be thereby furnished by them for the supply of the British W. India islands, the present ruinous contraband trade greatly interrupted, and a very beneficial carrying trade, in the article of plaster of Paris, in a great measure secured. 
' Or, if the Americans were dispossessed of these islands, there is no other situation in that neigh-]  

PASSAMAQUODDY.  [bourhood which could give them the advantages and opportunities to injure the trade of this province, which they now enjoy. 
' To these considerations it may be added, that in case of hostilities at any time in the United States, or countenance given by them to hostile attacks from any other country, the province, by the possession of these islands, would, in that quarter, be rendered more secure from attack, and capable of defence.' 
' Impressed with the importance of the foregoing considerations, we indulge the hope, that the transmission of the address by your honour to his Majesty's ministers may be productive of important benefits to the interests and welfare of his Majesty's subjects in this province. (Signed)

It receives on the e. side 25 rivers, and on the w. 15, and from that place takes the nameofPastaza, first running into those of San Felipe, Patate, and others of the villages by which it passes. In the woods of its vicinity towards the w. dwell some barbarian Indians, the Muratas and Xibaros, and towards the e. the Gaes, Semigaes, and Mainas Zimarrones. Its mouth is in lat. 48' 3" s.

==[[Pasto|PASTO]]==, a district and corregimiento of the province and government of Popayan in the Nuevo Reynode Granada; one of the 11 into which the same is divided, and the most s; : bounded Si by the province of Ibarra. It is extremely abundant in fine pastures, and consequently in cattle, so that, on this account, its first founders gave it this name. It is irrigated by several large rivers, which incorporate themselves with the Napo and Putumayo, to enter the Maranon or Amazon ; and on the s. flow down from the Cordillera, the river Guachicono, S. Jorqe, and Masamorras, which enter the Patia. It is of an hot temperature, and produces much wheat and of so fine a quality, that in no part of the world is the bread so fine as here. It has some gold mines, which are little worked from the want of Indians and Negroes ; the former being exempt from this labour by a royal edict, and devoting themselves rather to agricultural pursuits. In the woods are certain trees which distil a resin here called mopamopa, and of which they make all sorts of varnish, which is so durable, that neither have boiling water or acids any effect on it. The method of applying it is by putting into the mouth a part of the resin, and, when it is moistened, by rubbing the brush upon it, and then applying it to the object to be painted, when it becomes dry, and of a most beautiful and lively colour, imitating the China colours ; and with this particular recommendation, that it never fades, nor does moisture have any effect k2  PAS  upon it. The pictures and articles painted in this manner, are carried by the Indians to be sold at Quito and the other settlements of the kingdom, where they are in high estimation. 
In this province the rivers of Guaitara and Juanambu are passed en taravita, each person paying a silverreal, and the same being the price for every horseload ; and the settlements of the above names take care to be well provided with ropes, and other articles necessary for this purpose.

The capital is the city of the same name, with the dedicatory title of San Juan, and the surname of Villaviciosa ; founded by captain Lorenzo de Aldana, in 1539, in an extensive llanura. It is of a severe climate, but healthy, and fertile in vegetable productions, seeds, and sugar canes, of which they make much sugar. It is situate at the skirt of a mountain, at the top of which is a volcano, which, ever since the conquest, had never ceased to vomit fire and ashes until the year 1727, since which time, as no eruption has appeared, it is thought that all the inflammable materials have been consumed. 
It has a very good parish church, the convents of the order of San Francisco, Santo Domingo, San Agustin, La Merced, a college which belonged to the Jesuits, a monastery of nuns of LaConcepcion, and two hermitages at the entrance and egress of the city.

==[[Patagones|PATAGONES|Tirumenos]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians, who live in the mountains and woods of the lands of Magellan, n. of the strait, and e. of the kingdom of Chile, in the province called Chica. They go entirely naked and wander about, sustaining themselves by the chace. They are of lofty stature, well made and valorous, but treacherous ; some have pretended that they were formidable giants, and called their country  de Los Gigantes (of the giants). The father Torrubia, in his Gigantologia, printed in 1756, to prove the existence of the giants, quotes the Pata°-onians of the lands of Magellan ; but whoever 'scrutinizes the strength of what he advances, will see that according to all appearance and agreeably with the assertion of D. Proxpero del Aguila, he brings forward nothing of greater authenticity than what had already been produced. Mr. Fraser, in his voyage to S. America, assures us of the existence of these giants, not only as he had seen them himself but by an implicit credit of others who had also been eyewitnesses to them ; and he thus asserted them to be of nine or 10 feet in height. The general received opinion is, that they are certainly above the common stature, but not giants ; and with all the proofs and reasons produced by the father Torrubia, we cannot but rather give our assent to what is told us by Sir Hans Sloane, in his celebrated work inserted in the Philosophical Transactions, No. 404, and extracted as a supplement to the celebrated Chambers' Dictionary, as also to what has been so judiciously suggested on the subject by Dr. D. Casimiro, first professor of botany in the royal garden, in the translation of the voyage of commandant Byron. Fernando de Magallanes was the first who knew these Indians, when he arrived at port S. Julian, in 1519., The country abounds in stags, wolves, bears, tigers and ostriches. The names given by Mr. de la Martiniere to the different tribes of Envo, Kemenetes, Kennecas, and Karaykes, are mere fables and inventions, of which we cannot discover the origin, as are also the provinces in which the said tribes are said to live, and which that author calls Cossi, Karay, Karamay, Morena, Coin, &c. Now, all that we can assert on the subject, is, that we call the coast of the Patagonians all that extent from the mouth of the river La Plata as far as the straits of Magellan, and that the same was reconnoitred, by order of the king, in 1745, by the naval captain D. Joaquin de Olivares, accompanied by the fathers Joseph Carodiel and Joseph Quiroga, of the company of Jesus, and the pilot D. Diego Varela ; and that the extent of coast, included under the above title, is between lat. 36° 40' and 52° 20' s. and extends from Cape Antonio, to the bay of S. George, to the s. e. From all the above we conclude, that the Patagonians are a very large race of men, and that they are very numerous.

It is about 30 or 40 yards wide just before it communicates with the bason, on which stands the large commercial town of Baltimore. The first discoverer called it Bolus river, from the red earth found near it, resembling boleammoniac.

It extends between two low chains of mountains, and is divided by the river of its name : is of an hot temperature, and territory fertile in all kinds of vegetable productions, and particularly in sugar canes. The mountain Tunguraqua, which is situate to the s. renders it somewhat unpleasant, from the continual winds blowing from that quarter ; but it is well peopled, and has some pretty and well cultivated gardens. 
Its name is taken from that of the principal settlement, situate on the e. shore of the river. Here is manufactured much sugar, the which is greatly esteemed in all the kingdom from the superior quality of the sugar canes. There is one day in the week fixed for a holiday or public fair, at which meet numbers of people from Ambato, Tacunga, Rio Bamba, and Quito. In lat. l°21's. 
Patate, the aforesaid river rises in the province and corregimiento of Tacunga, of the same kingdom. It is formed by other smaller rivers, such as that of San Felipe, which rises in the paramo of Cotopaxi, that of San Miguel, near the settlement of this name, and that of Ambato. It takes, itself, its name from the settlement by which it passes in a large stream, following its course to s. e. until it enters the river Pastaza, in the province and government of Mainas. fPATAVIRCA.

==[[Pativa|PATIVA]]==, a small river of the province and captainship of Los Ilheos in Brazil. It rises near the coast, runs e. and enters the sea between the rivers Grande and Juzia. 
==[[Pativilca|PATIVILCA|Pativirca]]==, as others have it, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Santa in Peru ; situate in the road which they call De Valles, and which leads from Paita to Lima : [74 miles n. of that city.] It has 50 or 60 houses, with a proportionate number of inhabitants, but very few Spaniards. In its vicinity, towards the n. are seen the ruins and remains of a palace and fortress of the Incas of Peru, which, from the size of the stones and thickness of the walls, should   PAT appear to have been works of great magnificence. Alon»- the whole road from this settlement to the town* of Guarmey, we find ruins of other edifices equally sumptuous ; and it is proved that these were the places which the Incas used for their recreation. 
==[[Patla|PATLA]]==, Santa Maria de, a settlement of the head settlement of the district of Olintla, and alcaldia mayor of Zacatlan in Nueva Espaiia ; situate in a delightful glen, watered and fertilized by various rivers. Nine leagues from its head settlement. 
==[[Pato|PATO]]==, a settlement of the province and government Santa Marta in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, and of the district of the Rio del Hacha ; situate on the shore of this river, to the n. of its capital. Pato, a river of the province and government of Popayan in the same kingdom ; which rises in the paramo of Guanacas, runs S. e. and enters the Caqueta by the n. part, in lat. 1° 3V n. 
Pato, a small island, situate at the mouth of the gulf of Triste or Los Dragos, near the coast, in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada. 
Pato, another, a small river of the province and government of Guayana or Nueva Andalucia, which, according to Mr. Bellin, enters the Meta. 

==[[Patos|PATOS]]==, Laguna Grande de, a large lake in the province and captainship of Rey in Brazil. It is many leagues in length from n. to s., is near the coast, and on its side the Portuguese have established two guards, called, the one Del Norte, the other De la Cabellada. Patos, another lake, in the province and captainship of Todos Santos in the same kingdom. It is at the foot of the sierra of Mongavein, between the river Real and that of Paramerin. 
Patos, a river in the province and government of Florida, which runs s. and enters the sea to the w. of the river Apalachicola. 
Patos, another, a small river of the province and captainship of Rey in Brazil, which runs e. and enters the sea in the bay of Biraguera. 

[==[[Patowmack|PATOWMACK|Potomack]]==, a large and noble river, which rises by two branches, the n. and the s. which originate in and near the Alleghany mountains, and forms, through its whole course, part of the boundary between the states of Virginia and Maryland. Its course is n. e. to Fort Cumberland, thence turning to the e. it receives Conecochague creek from Pennsylvania; then pursuing a s. e. course, it receives the Shehandoah from the s. w. ; after this it runs a s. e. and s. course till it reaches Maryland point ;  
PAT  thence to its mouth it runs s. e. In its course it receives several considerable streams, which are described under their respective heads. The distance from the capes of Virginia to the termination of the tide water in this river, is above 300 miles including the windings ; and navigable for ships of the greatest burden nearly that distance. From thence this river, obstructed by four considerable falls, extends through a vast tract of inhabited country towards its source. Early in the year 1785, the legislatures of Virginia and Maryland passed acts to encourage opening the navigation of this river. It was estimated that the expence of the works would amount to £50,000 sterling, and 10 years were allowed for their completion. This noble river passes by many flourishing towns ; the chief of which are, Shepherdstown, Georgestown, Washington city, Alexandria, New Marlborough, and Charlestown or port Tobacco. It is 7f miles wide at its mouth, A\ at Nomony bay, three at Aquia, If at Hallowing point, and \\ at Alexandria. Its soundings are seven fathoms at the mouth, five at St. George's island, 4| at Lower Matchodic, three at Swan's point and thence up to Alexandria. The tides in the river are not very strong, excepting after great rains, when the ebb is pretty strong ; then there is little or no flood, and there is never more than four or five hours flood, except with long and strong s. winds. In order to form just conceptions of this inland navigation, it would be requisite to notice the long rivers which empty into the Patowmack, and survey the geographical position of the w. waters. The distance of the waters of the Ohio to Patowmack will be from 15 to 40 miles, according to the trouble which will be taken to approach the two navigations. The upper part of this river, until it passes the Blue ridge, is called, in Fry and Jefferson's map, Cohongoronto.] 

[==[[Patrick|PATRICK]]==, St. a small town, the chief of Camden county, Georgia ; situate on Great Sa-  tilla river, about 32 miles from its mouth, and the same distance n. w. of the town of St. Mary's.] 
[==[[Patterson|PATTERSON]]==, a town in Bergen county, New Jersey, called so in honour of the governor of the state of that name, and now one of the judges of the supreme federal court. It was established in consequence of an act of the legislature of New Jersey, in 1791, incorporating a manufacturing company with peculiar privileges. Its situation on the great falls of Passaic river, is healthy and agreeable. It now con-  Hi  mat  PAT  tains about 50 dwellinghouses, independent of those appropriated for the machinery ; and it is certainly one of the most convenient situations for a manufacturing town of any on the continent. This company was incorporated to encourage all kinds of manufactures, and the sum of 500,000 dollars was soon subscribed ; but for want of experience, and a proper knowledge of the business, much was expended to little purpose ; and they were at last reduced to the necessity of having recourse to a lottery to assist them in carrying their plan into execution. It is said that matters are now conducted more judiciously, and that the undertaking promises to be useful to the public, and beneficial to the proprietors. It is 19 miles n. e. of Morristown, and 10 n. of Newark.] 

[==[[Patucket|PATUCKET]]==, a small village about four miles n. e. of Providence, a busy place of considerable trade, and where manufactures of several kinds are carried on with spirit. Through this village runs Patucket, or Pawtucket river, which empties into Seehonk river at this place. The river Patucket, called more n. Blackstone's river, has a beautiful fall of water, directly over which a bridge has been built, on the line which divides the commonwealth of Massachusetts from the state of Rhode Island ; distant about 37 miles <s. by w. of Boston. The confluent stream empties into Providence river about a mile below Weybossett, or the Great bridge. The fall, in its whole length, is upwards of 50 feet ; and the water passes through several chasms in a rock, which, extending diametrically across the bed of the stream, serves as a dam to the water. Several mills have been erected upon these falls ; and the spouts and channels which have been constructed to conduct the streams of their respective wheels, and the bridge, have taken very much from the beauty and grandeur of the scene ; which would otherwise have been indescribably charming and romantic] 
==[[Patugoa|PATUGOA]]==, a river of the province and captainship of San Vincente in Brazil ; runs s. and enters the sea opposite the Isla Grande. 
==[[Pature|PATURE]]==, a point on the w. coast of the island S. Domingo, and in the part possessed by the French, between the Cayo Icarnier and the Trou Foi'ban. 
==[[Patute|PATUTE]]==, a settlement of Indians of the Tuneba nation, a reduction of missions which were held by the Jesuits in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada ; situate near the river Cazanare. The natives are weak, idle, and are subject to a disorder similar to St. Anthony's fire, which they   call carate, and paint their skin of various colours. They maintain themselves by collecting and selling the resins of certain trees of two kinds, called, the one carana, and the other otoba: they both have a fetid smell, but are good for curing the itch, worms which are apt to breed in the feet, and crablice. After the abolition of the order of the Jesuits, these missions fell under the charge of the religious order of S. Domingo. 
==[[Patuxed|PATUXED]]==, a large, handsome, and convenient bay, of the province and colony of New England. 
==[[Patuxent|PATUXENT|Patuxet]]==, a river of the province and colony of Maryland in N. America. [This river, which is navigable, rises about 10 miles n. e. of Washington, empties into the w. side of Chesapeak bay, between Drum and Hog island points, 15 or 20 miles n. of the mouth of the Patowmac. It admits vessels of 250 tons to Nottingham, nearly 35 miles from its mouth, and of boats to Queen Anne, eight miles higher. Patuxent is as remarkable a river as any in the bay, having very high land on its n. side, with red banks or cliffs. When you double Drum point, you come too in 2f and 3 fathoms water, where you will be secure from all winds.] 
==[[Paucanna|PAUCANNA]]==, a river of the province and government of San Juan de los Llanos in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada. It rises s. of the Sinaruco, and, forming a curve in its course to the e. enters the Orunuco, collecting in its midcareer the waters of the Sinaruco. 
==[[Paucar|PAUCAR]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Tarma in Peru ; annexed to the curacy of Caina.

Paucara, another settlement, in the province and corregimiento of Lucanas in the same kingdom ; annexed to the curacy of Paico. 

==[[Paucarbamba|PAUCARBAMBA]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Guanta in the same kingdom. 
==[[Paucarbambilla|PAUCARBAMBILLA]]==, a settlement of the same province and kingdom as the former ; annexed to the curacy of Mayoc. 
==[[Paucarcolla|PAUCARCOLLA]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru ; bounded n. e. by the lake of Titicaca, and being surrounded on the e. by the lake and the province of Chuicuito, n. by that of Lampa, w. by the province Moquehua, and s. by the provinces of Arica and Pacajes. It is   86 leagues long, and 28 broad. The principal rivers by which it is laved are, the Suches and the Taraco. It is of a generally cold temperature, and in the parts near the lake are cultivated papas, bark, barley, and other seeds peculiar to Puno. 
The principal occupation of the inhabitants is in breeding neat cattle, sheep, and pigs, as also sheep of the country, or llamas. Here are many vicunas, vizcaehas, deer, cuyes, partridges, and water fowl of the lake ; from which also there is a good supply of fish, both for this and the other provinces situate on its shore. The natives make voyages to the other provinces of the coast to carry chunos, dressed hides, and thread, and to take in exchange wines, brandies, and other productions. From the wools of the cattle the Indians fabricate their clothes, dying them of various colours. 
The capital of this province was the settlement of the same name, and afterwards, from the population of this having declined, it was that of Huancane, until the discovery of the mines of Laicaeota, when the latter asiento became the chief town ; and after that, and at the present day, the town of Puno. 
This province has various other rich mines in the mountains of Cancharani and of San Joseph, which have been worked with great benefit ; particularly the former. On the n. of the aforesaid mountains is the mountain called Del Azogue (quicksilver), as having veins of this metal, and which in the time of the viceroy, the Count de Alva de Liste, was worked to such advantage as to excel both in the quality and quantity of its metal the mine of Guancavelica : for motives, however, of higher consideration, its further working was prohibited by the government ; but since that time large proportions of silver have still been extracted from those mountains, and from that of Cancharani not less than 50,000 marks annually. 
The Indians of some settlements of this province, who breed cattle, have a traffic of carrying to the mineral engines and mills much cowdung, which they call taquia, and which they use for heating the metal instead of wood and coal, these articles being extremely dear. This practice is also adopted in the other provinces of the same temperature. 
It had a repartimiento of 102,880 dollars, and it paid an alcavala of 832 dollars annually. Its inhabitants consists of more than 26,000 souls, divided into the following settlements :

Paucarcolla, a settlement of this province, which, as we have observed, was the capital, until that having greatly fallen off" in population it resigned this title in favour of the settlement of Huancane. It is situate on the shore of the lake Titicaca. Its natives became voluntarily subject to Iloque Yupanqui third emperor of Peru. It is inhabited by some Spanish families, and is of an healthy but cold climate. 

==[[Paucarpata|PAUCARPATA]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Arequipa in Peru. 
==[[Paucartambo|PAUCARTAMBO]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru ; bounded n. w. and ay. by that of Calca and Lares, n. e. and e. by the frontier of the infidel Indians, and s. by that of Quispicanchi. Its length is 26 leagues from n. to s. and from six to seven in width. Its temperature is cold on the heights, but in the low parts moderately warm. It produces a good quantity of wheat, barley, maize, papas, seeds, and other fruits. It is a ravine or large valley terminating in the mountains of the Andes, in which different fruit trees grow, such as papayas, lemons, watermelons, some cotton, and coca in abundance. The trees here are of excellent wood, and amongst the rest are fine cedars. Also here are parrots of different kinds, monkeys, tigers, and venomous reptiles. Through this province passes a river, which comes from the lakes of the cordillera of Vilcanota, which, augmented by the waters of various small rivers and streams, forms a considerable body of water, in which they catch soles, dories, olivefish, and other fish ; this river bearing the name of the province. 
Towards the frontiers of the infidel Indians it is not remembered that any conversions having been made ; but, in 1767, a Dominican priest of the province of Quito, who arrived here whilst on the charitable commission of collecting funds for the building of the church of his convent, visited the mountain, and brought back with him some 300 barbarian Indians who, notwithstanding their inconstancy and rudeness, give grounds of expectation of a numerous conversion. 
In the mountains of this province are clear inl,  P A U  dications of mines both of silver and gold, since the Indians, in some of the streams, pick up little lumps of these metals. There are no mines, however, that are worked, although there is evidently one of quicksilver. Its corregidor had a repartimiento of 59,600, dollars, and it paid an alcabala of 467 dollars annually. The inhabitants should amount to about 8000. The capital is the settlement of the same name, situate on the e. shore of the river of its name, 33 miles e. n. e. of the city of Cuzco, in lat. 13° 28' s, and the settlements of its jurisdiction are, Paucartambo, Huayac,

[PAULIN'S Kill. See Sussex County, New Jersey.] 

==[[Paulo|PAULO]]==, S. or S. Pablo, a city of the province and captainship of S. Vicente, in the king* dom of Brazil, the capital of a small republic, separate from the government of the Portuguese, having its own laws, but tributary to this crown. It had its origin from some Mamelucs, a people composed of desperate banditti of all nations and colours, who, not conforming to the customs of more civilized life, and alike averse to all law, retired to the mountainous parts of the country, the same, however, not being deficient in natural fertility, and even in goldmines. Here their numbers daily increased, till they became so formidable and independent as to call themselves the Paulistas, or inhabitants of the city of S. Paulo. This was the capital of their territory, and great was the zeal and skill they have manifested in its defence, and in the maintenance of their selfestablished rights : they were, however, at last overcome, and rendered so far tributary to the Portuguese monarch, that they were to pay to him the fifth part of what they extracted from their mines. These mines are exceedingly rich, and to work at them they are sedulous in their endeavours to entrap Spaniards, Portu-  
PAULO.  guese, and Indians. They have no religion whatever, but some dealings with the Spaniards and Portuguese of Paraguay. 
The city is situate on an eminence, surrounded by the most craggy and inaccessible mountains, on the s. shore of the river Harihambu, or Tiete, in 46° 38' w. long. 23° 32' lat. s. 
[The following particulars relating to this city are extracted from the work of Mr. Mawe, the traveller — St. Paul's, he observes, although on an elevated site, is not observed at any great distance in the road from Todos Santos. In its immediate neighbourhood the river runs parallel to the road, which it sometimes partially overflows, and covers with sand. To his left he observed a large astallage, or inn, where numbers of mules are unloaded, and travellers commonly pass the night. It consists of a very large shed, supported upon upright pieces of timber, with separate divisions for receiving the cargoes or burdens of the mules, each traveller occupying as many as his goods require ; and there is a piece of ground, of about a hundred yards in circumference, planted with small upright stakes at ten or fifteen feet distance, to which the bridles of the mules are tied while they are fed, saddled, and loaded. These astallages are common in all parts of Brazil. 
On entering the town, he was struck with the neat appearance of its houses, stuccoed in various colours ; those in the principal streets were two or three stories high. 
St. Paul's is situated on a pleasing eminence of about two miles in extent, surrounded on three sides by low meadowland, and washed at the base by rivulets, which almost insulate it in rainy weather ; it is connected with the highland by a narrow ridge. The rivulets flow into a pretty large stream called Tieti, which runs within a mile of the town in a s. w. direction. Over them there are several bridges, some of stone and others of wood, built by the late governor. The streets of St. Paul's, owing to its elevation, (about 50 feet above the plain) and the water which almost surrounds it, are in general remarkably clean ; the material with which they are paved is lamillary gritstone, cemented by oxide of iron, and containing large pebbles of rounded quartz, approximating to the conglomerate. This pavement is an alluvial formation containing gold, many particles of which metal are found in the chinks and hollows after heavy rains, and at such seasons are diligently sought for by the poorer sort of people. 
This city was founded by the Jesuits, who were  probably tempted by the gold mines in the vicinity, more than by the salubrity of its air, which however is not excelled by any on the whole continent of South America. The medium of the thermometer here is between 50 and 80 degrees ; in a morning Mr. Mawe observed it at 48°, and even lower, though he was not there in the winter months. The rains are by no means heavy or of long continuance, and the thunderstorms are far from being violent. The cold in the evenings was frequently considerable. Here are several squares, and about thirteen places of religious worship, namely, two convents, three monasteries, and eight churches, the greater part of which, as well as of the whole town, is built of earth. The mode of erecting the walls is as follows : a frame is constructed of six moveable planks placed edgewise, opposite each other, and secured in this position by crosspieces bolted with moveable pins. Earth is put in by small quantities, which the workmen beat with rammers, and occasionally moisten with water to give it consistency. Having filled the frame or trough, they remove it and continue the same operation till the whole shell of the house is completed, taking care to leave vacancies, and put in the windowframes, doorframes, and beams, as they proceed. The mass, in course of time, becomes indurated, the walls are pared perfectly smooth inside, and take any colour the owner chooses to give them ; they are generally enriched with very ingenious devices. This species of structure is durable ; some houses thus built have lasted two hundred years, and most of them have several stories. The roofs are made to project two or three feet beyond the wall, in order to throw off the rain to a distance from the base; spouts might be a more effectual preservative against wet, but their use is little known here. They cover their houses with guttertiles ; but though the country affords excellent clay and plenty of wood, very few bricks are burnt. 
The population of this place amounts to full 15,000 souls, perhaps nearer 20,000 ; the clergy, including all ranks of religious orders, may be ranked at 500. They are in general good members of society, free from that excessive bigotry and illiberality which is the reproach of the neighbouring colonies ; and their example has so beneficial an effect on the rest of the inhabitants, that, according to Mr. Mawe's testimony, no stranger will be molested while he acts as a gentleman, and does not insult the established religion. 
No endemial diseases at present prevail here.] l, 2

PAULO.  
[The smallpox formerly, and indeed of late, made great havoc amongthe inhabitants ■ but its progress has been checked by the introduction of vaccine innoculation. Professors attended at a large hall belonging to the governor, to which the public were invited, and the operation was performed gratis. It is to be hoped, that the credit of this preventative will make its way among the people here, for they are not competent to enter into the merits of that controversy which injured it in Europe. 
Here are few manufactures of any consequence ; a little coarse cotton is spun by the hand, and woven into cloth, which serves for a variety of wearing apparel, sheets, &c. They make a beautiful kind of network for hammocks, which are fringed with lace, and form an elegant piece of furniture, being slung low, so as to answer the purpose of sofas. The ladies are particularly fond of using them, especially when the heat of the weather disposes them to ease and indolence. The making of lace is a general employment for females, some of whom excel in it. The shopkeepers here are a numerous class, who, as in most colonial towns, deal in almost every thing, and sometimes make great fortunes. Here are few doctors of medicine, but many apothecaries ; some silversmiths, whose articles are equally indifferent both in metal and workmanship ; tailors and shoemakers in great numbers ; and joiners, who manufacture very beautiful wood, but are not so moderate in their charges as the former classes of tradesmen. In the outskirts of the city live a number of Creolian Indians, who make earthenware for culinary purposes, large waterjars, and a variety of other utensils ornamented with some taste. The greatest proportion of the inhabitants consists in farmers and inferior husbandmen, who cultivate small portions of land, on which they breed large stocks of pigs and poultry for sale. With these the market is generally well supplied, and in the fruit season is also stored with pines, grapes, guanas, bananas, a few apples, and an enormous quantity of quinces. 
Esculent plants are grown in great profusion and variety. Here is a favourite bulbous root called the cara, which is equal to the best potatoe, and even more farinaceous ; it grows to about five inches in diameter, and affords excellent food, either boiled or roasted. Here are fine cabbages, saladherbs, turnips, cauliflowers, artichokes, and potatoes; the latter, though very good, are little used : the sweet potatoe is in greater request among the natives. Maize, beans,  greenpeas, and every species of pulse, flourish amazingly. Fowls are cheap ; some are bought at threepence and sixpence each ; small pigs from one to two shillings, and flitches of bacon, cured after the mode of the country, at about twopence per pound. Turkeys, geese, and ducks, are abundant, and reasonable in price ; the latter are of the Muscovy breed, enormously large, some weighing ten or fourteen pounds. Here is a singular breed of cocks; they resemble the common English in plumage and shape, but they crow very loud, and continue their last note for a minute or two. When their voice is good, they are much esteemed, and are sent for as curiosities from all parts of Brazil. The cattle are in general good, considering that so little attention is paid to feeding them ; when their pastures are full of grass, they are tolerably fat, but when otherwise, they become lean. A drove may be bought at 24s. or 30s. a head ; beef at about a penny or three halfpence per pound. The curriers have a singular method of blackening cowhides and calfskins : when they have prepared them for that operation, they search for some mudhole at the bottom of a ferruginous stratum, a ditch for instance ; with the mud they cover that side of the skin required to be stained ; and they prefer this material to the solution of copperas, probably with reason, as the sulphate of iron formed by the decomposed pyrites acts more mildly in this state than when applied in the common way. 
The horses are very fine, and in general docile; when well trained they make excellent chargers. Their size is from 12| to 14| hands, and they vary in price from £3 to £12. Mules are considered more useful beasts of burden. The breed of sheep is quite unattended to, and mutton is rarely or never eaten. Here is a very fine and large breed of goats, whose milk is generally used for domestic purposes. The dogs are very indifferent, and of no distinct race. 
Mr. Mawe, in his walks round the city, had frequent opportunities of examining the singular succession of horizontal strata, that form the eminence on which it stands. They lie in the following order: — first, one of red vegetable earth of variable depth, impregnated with oxide of iron ; below that, sand and adventitious matter of different shades of colour, as ochrered, brown, and dusky yellow, together with many rounded pebbles, which indicate it to be of rather recent formation ; it varies in depth from three to six feet, or perhaps to seven, and its lower part is uniformly yellow : under this is a bed of ex-]  

PAULO.  fceedingly fine clay of various colours, but for the the most part purple ; the white and yellow is the purest in quality ; it is interveined with thin layers of sand in various directions. Then succeeds a stratum of alluvial matter, which is very feruoinous ; it rests on a halfdecomposed substance, apparently migrating from a granite, in which the proportion of feldspar exceeds that of the quartz and mica. The whole is incumbent on compact granite. The sides of the mount are steep, and in some places nearly perpendicular. 
The fertility of the country around bt. Paul s maybe inferred from the quantities of produce, with which, as we have stated, its market is supplied. About a century ago, this track abounded with gold ; and it was not until they had exhausted it by washing, that the inhabitants thought of employing themselves in husbandry. As they did so more from necessity than from choice, they were tardy in pursuing those improvements which other nations have made in this noble art, and, pining at the disappearance of the precious mineral, considered their new occupation as vile and degrading. Indeed throughout the whole of Brazil, the husbandmen have ever been considered as forming a class greatly inferior in point of respectability to the miners ; and this prejudice will in all likelihood subsist until the country shall have been drained of its gold and diamonds, when the people will be compelled to seek in agriculture a constant and -inexhaustible source of wealth. 
Mr. Mawe thus describes the system of farming which at present prevails in the neighbourhood of St. Paul's. Land, in this extensive empire, is granted in large tracks, on proper application ; and we may naturally suppose that the value of these tracts depends more or less on their situation. It therefore becomes the first object of a cultivator, to look out for unoccupied lands as near as possible to a large town ; good roads and navigable rivers are the desiderata next in point of consequence which he attends to. When he has made choice of a situation, he applies to the governor of the district, who orders the proper officers to mark out the extent required, generally a league or a league and a half square, sometimes more. The cultivator then purchases as many Negroes as he can, and commences his operations by erecting habitations for them and himself, which are generally miserable sheds, supported by four posts, and commonly called ranchos. His Negroes are then directed to cut down the trees and brushwood growing on the land, to  such an extent as he thinks they will be able to manage. This done, they set fire to all they have cut, as it lies on the ground. Much of the success of his harvest depends on this burning ; if the whole be reduced to ashes he expects a great crop ; if, through wet weather, the felled trees remain only half burnt, he prognosticates a bad one. When the ground is cleared, the Negroes dibble it with their hoes, and sow their maize, beans, or other pulse ; during the operation they cut down any thing very much in the way, but never think of working the soil. After sowing as much seed as is thought requisite, they prepare other grounds for planting cassada, here called mandioca, the root of which is generally eaten as bread by all ranks in Brazil. The soil for this purpose is rather better prepared ; it is raked up in little round hillocks, not unlike molehills, about four feet asunder ; into which are stuck cuttings from branches of the plant, about an inch thick, and six or eight long ; these soon take root, and put forth leaves, shoots, and buds. When enough has been planted for the entire consumption of the farm, the owner, if he is rich enough, prepares means for growing and manufacturing sugar. He first employs a carpenter to cut wood, and build a mill with wooden rollers for crushing the canes, by means of water if a stream is at hand, if not, by the help of mules. While some of the Negroes are assisting the carpenter, others are employed in preparing ground in the same way as for mandioca. Pieces of cane, containing three or four joints, and in length about six inches, cut from the growing stem, are laid in the earth nearly horizontally, and are covered with soil to the depth of about four inches. They shoot up rapidly, and in three months have a bushy appearance not unlike flags ; in 12 or 15 months more they are ready for cutting. In rich virgin soil it is not uncommon to see canes 12 feet high, and astonishingly thick. 
The Indian corn and pulse are in general ripe in four months or 18 weeks. The average return is 200 for one ; it is a bad harvest when it falls short of 150. 
The mandioca is rarely ready to take up in less than 18 or 20 months ; if the land be suitable, it then produces from six to 12 pound weight per plant. They grow very little indigo in this neighbourhood, and what they have is of indifferent quality. Their pumpkins are of enormous size, and sometimes are served up as tablevegetables, but more frequently given as food to the horses. Melons are here scarcely palatable. In no branch of husbandry are the farmers so]

PAULO.  
[defective as in the management of cattle. No artificial grasses are cultivated, no enclosures are made, nor is anj fodder laid up against the season of scarcity. The cows are never milked regularly ; they seem to be considered rather as an encumbrance to a farm than a valuable part of the stock. They constantly require salt, which is given them once in 15 or 20 days, in small proportions. Their dairies, if such they may be called, are managed in so slovenly a manner, that the little butter that is made becomes rancid in a few days, and the cheese is good for nothing. In this essential department they are deplorably deficient ; rarely indeed is there to be seen a farm with one convenience belonging to it. For want of proper places in which to store their produce, they are obliged to lay it in promiscuous neaps ; and it is not uncommon to see coffee, cotton, maize, and beans, thrown into the corners of a damp shed, and covered with a green hide, one half is invariably spoiled by mould and putridity, and the remainder is much deteriorated, through this idle and stupid negligence. 
They feed their pigs on Indian corn in a crude state ; the time for confining them to fatten is at eight or 10 months old ; and the quantity consumed for the purpose is eight or 10 Winchester bushels each. When killed, the lean is cut off the sides as clean as possible, the fat is cured with very little salt, and in a few days is ready for market. The ribs, chinebone, and lean parts are dried for home consumption. 
The farmhouses are miserable hovels of one story, the floor neither paved nor boarded, and the walls and partitions formed of wickerwork plastered with mud, and never underdrawn. For an idea of the kitchen, which ought to be the cleanest and most comfortable part of the dwelling, the reader may figure to himself a filthy room with an uneven muddy floor, interspersed with pools of slopwater, and in different parts fireplaces formed by three round stones to hold the earthen pots that are used for boiling meat ; as green wood is the chief fuel, the place is almost always filled with smoke, which, finding no chimney, vents itself through the doors and other apertures, and leaves all within as black as soot. Indeed, the kitchens of many opulent people are in not much better condition. 
It may well be imagined that in a country like this, a stranger finds the greatest comfort and enjoyment out of doors. The gardens in St. Paul's and its vicinity, are laid out with great taste, and many of them with curious elegance. The jasmine is every where a favourite tree, and  in this fine climite bears flowers perennially, as does the rose. Carnations, pinks, passionflowers, cockscombs, &c. grow in great plenty ; one of their most estimable shrubs is the Palma Christi, which gives fruit the first year, and yields abundance of castoroil, which all families possess in such quantity, that no other sort is burnt. 
Bees are by no means uncommon ; they are easily domesticated, and, we believe, are perfectly harmless. Their honey is pleasant ; the wax, particularly that generally sold, which is taken froni their nests in old foresttrees, is very foul, but might be purified by a very simple process. The woods contain a great variety of animals of the monkey kind, and also beasts of prey, some  of which have tolerable good fur.  
Among these  may be classed a peculiar species of the otter. Insects are numerous, but the mosquitos are not so offensively so as in the Rio de la Plata. The animalculum, called the niagua, or jigger, is troublesome ; it beds itself under the nails of the toes, and sometimes of the fingers, but it may easily be banished by extracting it and its bag of eggs with a needle, and filling the cavity with calomel or snuff, for fear any should have remained. Reptiles are very numerous ; toads are accustomed in the evenings to crawl upon the foot paths, and even infest the streets of the city. The sorocooco or jararraca (serpents) are said to be very dangerous. 
The woods produce large and durable timber, well calculated for building. Of their trees, all of which retain their Indian names, some yield very fine gums. The jacarandd, called in England rosewood, is here very common. Many of their shrubs bear beautiful flowers, and are very aromatic. Among the innumerable creeping plants which clothe the soil of their uncleared lands, there are some distinguished as infallible antidotes to the bite of venomous reptiles ; one in particular, called the corazao de Jesu, with heartshaped leaves, is universally esteemed. 
Mr. Mawe, during his stay at this city, was invited by the governor to visit the old gold mines of Jaragua, the first discovered in Brazil, which were now his property, together with a farm in their vicinity, distant about 24 miles from the city. 
He thus explains the mode of working these mines, more fitly to be denominated washings. 
Suppose a loose gravellike stratum of rounded quartzose pebbles and adventitious matter, incumbent on granite, and covered by earthy matter of variable thickness. Where water of sufficiently high level can be commanded, the}  

PAULO.  (Wound is cut in steps, each SO or SO feet wide, two or three broad, and about one deep. Near the bottom a trench is cut to the depth of two or three feet. On each step stand six or eight Negroes, who as the water flows gently from above, keep the earth continually in motion with shovels, until the whole is reduced to liquid mud and washed below. The particles of gold contained in this earth descend to the trench, where, by reason of their specific gravity, they quickly precipitate. Workmen are continually employed at the trench to remove the stones, and clear away the surface, which operation is much assisted by the current of water which falls into it. After five days washing, the precipitation in the trench is carried to some convenient stream, to undergo a second clearance. For this purpose wooden bowls are provided, of a funnel shape, about two feet wide at the mouth, and five or six inches deep, called gamettas. Each workman standing in the stream, takes into his bowl five or six pounds weight of the sediment, which generally consists of heavy matter, such as oxide of iron, pyrites, ferruginous quartz, &e. of a dark carbonaceous hue. They admit certain quantities of water into the bowls, which they move about so dexterously, that the precious metal, separating from the inferior and lighter substances, settles to the bottom and sides of the vessel. They then rinse their bowls in a larger vessel of clean water, leaving the gold in it ; and begin again. The washing of each bowlful occupies from five to eight or nine minutes ; the gold produced is extremely variable in quantity, and in the size of its particles, some of which are so minute, that they float, while others are found as large as peas, and not unfrequently much larger. This operation is superintended by overseers, as the result is of considerable importance. When the whole is finished, the gold is borne home to be dried, and at a convenient time is taken to the permutation office, where it is weighed, and a fifth is reserved for the prince. The remainder is smelted by fusion with muriate of mercury, cast into ingots, assayed, and stamped according to its intrinsic value, a certificate of which is given with it : after a copy of that instrument has been duly entered at the mintoffice, the ingots circulate as specie. 
But to return to the description of St. Paul's. This city is seldom visited by foreigners. The passes to it from the coast are so singularly situated, that it is almost impossible to avoid the guards who are stationed in them, to inspect all travellers and merchandize passing into the  interior. Soldiers of the lowest rank on these stations have a right to examine all strangers who present themselves, and to detain them and their property, unless they can produce passports. 
The dress of the ladies abroad, and especially at church, consists of a garment of black silk, with a long veil of the same material, trimmed with broad lace ; in the cooler season black cassimere or baize. In the same veil they almost always appear in the streets, though it has been partially superseded by a long coat of coarse woollen, edged with velvet, gold lace, fustian, or plush, according to the rank of the wearer. This coat is used as a general sort of undress, at home, in their evening walks, and on a journey, and the ladies, whenever they wear it, appear in round hats. The appellation of Paulista is considered by all the females here as a great honour ; the Paulistas being celebrated throughout all Brazil for their attractions, and their dignity of character. At table they are extremely abstemious ; their favourite amusement is dancing, in which they display much vivacity and grace. At balls and other public festivals they generally appear in elegant white dresses, with a profusion of gold chains about their necks, their hair tastefully disposed and fastened with combs. Their conversation, at all times sprightly, seems to derive additional life from music. Indeed the whole range of their education appears to be confined to superficial accomplishments ; they trouble themselves very little with domestic concerns, confiding whatever relates to the inferior departments of the household to the negro or negra cook, and leaving all other matters to the management of servants. Owing to this indifference, they are total strangers to the advantages of that order, neatness and propriety, which reign in an English family : their time at home is mostly occupied in sewing, embroidery, and lacemaking. Another circumstance repugnant to delicacy is, that they have no mantuamakers of their own sex ; all articles of female dress here are made by tailors. An almost universal debility prevails among them, which is partly attributable to their abstemious living, but chiefly to want of exercise, and, in some degree, to the frequent warm bathings in which they indulge. They are extremely attentive to every means of improving the delicacy of their persons, perhaps to the injury of their health. 
The men in general, especially those of the higher rank, officers, and others, dress superbly ; in company they are very polite and attentive, and show every disposition to oblige ; they are]   
■■■■■■■Mi    
[great talkers and prone to conviviality. The lower ranks, compared with those of other colonial towns, are in a very advanced state of civilization. It were to be wished that some reform were instituted in their system of education ; the  children of slaves are brought up during their early days with those of their masters ; they are playmates and companions, and thus a familiar equality is established between them, which has to be forcibly abolished when they arrive at that age, at which one must command and live at his ease, while the other must labour and obey. It has been said, that by thus attaching the slave to his master, in early youth, they ensure his future fidelity ; but the custom seems fraught with many disadvantages, and ought at least to be so modified as to render the yoke of bondage less galling by the recollection of former liberty. 
The religious processions here are very splendid, grand, and solemn ; they have a striking effect, by reason of the profound veneration and enthusiastic zeal manifested by the populace. On particular occasions of this kind all the inhabitants of the city attend, and the throng is frequently increased by numbers of the neighbouring peasantry for several leagues round. The balconies of those houses, which command the  best views of the spectacle, are crowded with ladies in their gala dresses, who consider the day as a kind of festival ; the evening is generally concluded by tea and card parties or dances. 
A traveller has no difficulty in accommodating himself in the general mode of living at St. Paul's. The bread is pretty good, and the butter tolerable, but rarely used except with coffee for breakfast or tea in the evening. A more common breakfast is a very pleasant sort of beans, called feijones, boiled or mixed with mandioca. Dinner, which is usually served up at noon or before, commonly consists of a quantity of greens boiled with a little fat pork or beef, a root of the potatoe kind, and a stewed fowl, with excellent salad, to which succeeds a great variety of delicious conserves and sweetmeats. Very little wine is taken at meals ; the usual beverage is water. On public occasions, or when a feast is given to a large party, the table is most sumptuously spread; from SO to 50 dishes are served up at once, by which arrangement a succession of courses is obviated. Wine circulates copiously, and toasts are given during the repast, which usually occupies two or three hours, and is succeeded by sweetmeats, the pride of their tables ; after coffee the company pass the evening in dancing, music, or cards.   
On the two first days of Lent, which are here celebrated with great festivity, persons of both sexes amuse themselves by throwing at each other balls, of artificial fruit, such as lemons or oranges, made very delicately of wax, and filled with perfumed water. The lady generally hegins the game, the gentleman return it with such spirit that it seldom ceases until several dozens are thrown, and both parties are as wet as if they had been drawn through a river. Sometimes a lady will dexterously drop one in to the bosom of a gentleman, which will infallibly oblige him to change his linen, as it usually contains three or four ounces of cold water. On these days of carnival the inhabitants parade the streets in masks, and the diversion of throwing fruit is practised by persons of all ages. It is reckoned improper for men to throw at each other. The manufacture of these missiles, at such periods., affords no inconsiderable occupation to certain classes of the inhabitants ; and in the capital of Brazil many hundreds of people derive a tem~ porary subsistence from the sale of them. The practice is very annoying to strangers, and not unfrequently engenders quarrels, which terminate seriously.] (Mawe's Travels.)

PAZ, Nuestra Senora de ea, or Chuquiavo ; called also Pueblo Nuevo, a city of the kingdom of Peru : founded by Alonzo de Mendoza in 1548, and not in 1558, as some assert, in the ancient province of Pacajes, and in a beautiful llanura, called Chuquiavo, by order of the licentiate Pedro de la Gasca, governor of Peru ; who gave it this name in memory of the pacification of that kingdom from the civil wars it had experienced. m . 
It is the head of a bishopric, erected in 1605 by the pontiff Paul V. It has a beautiful cathedralchurch, in which is venerated an image of Nuestra Senora del Pelar of Zaragoza, the gift of the emperor Charles V. ; four parishes, which  are, El Sagrario, in which is reverenced a very small image of Jesus Nazarens, which, in 1622, underwent a miraculous sweat for several times, and to the evidence of the people ; Santa Barbara ; San Sebastian and San Pedro : five convents of the religious orders of San Francisco ; Santo Domingo; San Agustin ; La Merced; San Juan de Dios, with an hospital ; and a col-  

PAZ  lege which belonged to the Jesuits ; two monasteries of nuns, one of La Concepcion, another of barefooted Carmelites : a seminary college, with the dedicatory title of San Geronimo, for the instruction of youth, under the care of the Jesuits : and a house for recluse Avomen. 
The territory of its situation is rough and uneven, and its temperature cold, as bearing only three leagues from the cordiltera. From this flows down a stream which intersects the town, and over which is thrown three stone bridges of one arch each. By this stream are frequently found washed up bits of gold of the finest quality ; and, in 1730, a bit was found of the value of 12,000 dollars, which was sent to the king. In the middle of the chief square is a beautiful fountain sprouting from three bodies of white stone. The country is fertile, pleasant, and abundant, in barley, papas, and coca. The word Chuquiavo is corrupted from Choqueyapu, which, in the Aimaran language, which is that of the natives, signifies an inheritance of gold. 
The bishop is suffragan to the archbishopric of Charcas, and not of Lima, as Mr. Martiniere asserts. The arms of this city, which were granted by the empeior Charles V., are a shield, and in the highest part of it an helmet and a dove with a branch of olive in its beak ; in the centre a crown ; below this, on one side, a lion, and on the other a lamb, both standing under a river, the motto being as follows : 
" Los discordes encontrados En paz y amor sejuntaron ; Y Pueblo de Paz fundaron Para perpetua memoria."

Don Feliciano de la Vega, native of Lima ; a man of extraordinary literature and talent : he was canon in his native place, chanter and provisor of the archbishop Don Bartolome Lobo Guerrero, and made governor of the archbishopric by Don Fernando Arias de Ugarte, commissary of crusade and of the inquisition, morning professor of canons in that university ; and so profound a lawyer, that Fr. Buenaventura de Salinas asserts, that of the four thousand sentences which he gave, civil or criminal, not one was ever revoked. He was elected bishop of Popayan, and from thence translated to the see of La Paz in 1639, and promoted in the same year to the archbishopric of Mexico.

==[[Pennsylvania|PENNSYLVANIA]]==, a province of N. America, one of those which compose the United States ; situate between New York to the n. New Jersey to the e. Virginia and Ohio to the w. and Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware to the 5. It is about 265 miles long, and 158 wide ; between lat. 39° 43' and 42° 20' n. and long. 74° 47' and 80° 37' w. This province is watered by several rivers, amongst the most considerable of which are the Delaware, Susquehannah, and Schuilkill. The first of these rises to the n. in the country of the Iroquees Indians, and of Bristol. The other  two rivers have their origin in the same country, and are navigable to a greater extent, facilitating the internal commerce. This province is divided into the following counties : Philadelphia, Bucks, 
Northampton, York, 
Chester, Berks, 
Lancaster, Cumberland ; and the other part of the river Delaware into the counties of Newcastle, Kent, and Sussex. It was granted to the celebrated William Penn, son of the great admiral of the same name, in the time of the protector Cromwell and of king Charles II. of England, in 1680. It was first ceded to the admiral in reward for his services, but he dying, the son did not solicit the title, until the persecution of the Quakers in England had become general ; and he then set out for America, and bought this territory of the Indians at a very low rate. He afterwards entered into commercial dealings to a small extent with these natives, and impressed them with very favourable ideas of him; and under such auspicious beginnings, he proceeded in peopling the country thus newly acquired ; the disgust which the Quakers began to feel to their native home, and their consequent emigration, greatly conducing to this end. The territory was, to be sure, uncultivated, and the climate strange and unknown to them, but Penn did not cease to animate and increase his new colonists. He spent large sums of money in transporting and providing them with every necessary ; and, not aspiring to enrich himself suddenly, he sold at a fair price a piece of territory to each ; with the which, and by the letter of privilege which he gave them, he transformed the country from a forest into a garden. Thus it has been, and is, one of the most flourishing colonies of the New World, and where the name of Penn is held in grateful remembrance. 
The climate of Pennsylvania is very delightful, and the air soft and mild. The autumn begins here on the 20th of October, and lasts till the beginning of December, when the winter commences. The cold and frosts are considerable, so that the river Delaware, although very wide, is frequently frozen, but the air is dry and healthy. The spring lasts from March till June, and then the weather is more fickle than at other times. The heat in the months of July, August, and September, is very great, but it is much mitigated by the cool refreshing breezes. The s. w. wind lasts the greater part of the summer, and the n. and n. w. blow in the winter and spring ; and  
—7\m  

TV>  PENNSYLVANIA.  these, passing over the lakes which are frozen, and through the snowy mountains of Canada, are the cause of the coldness in those seasons. 
The soil is, in some parts, of a yellow or black sand, and in some of a kind of light earth, and in others of a clay, similar to that of the valleys in England ; and which is found here more particularly near the sources of the shores of the rivers which irrigate the country. The land is fertile, rich, and easily cidtivated, and the roots of the trees shoot down to a very small depth. 
Pennsylvania is watered by many rivers, and produces in the greatest abundance whatever contributes to the convenience or luxury of life. In a word there is not a part of N. America so flourishing, nor where, in a few years, the population has experienced so rapid an increase. In 1729 no less than 6208 persons, four or five hundred of whom were Irish, came to establish themselves here ; and it is not wonderful that since the time of Penn, the value of lands has greatly risen. It contains 35,000 inhabitants, including the county of Delaware. There is no established religion ; and with the mixture of Germans, Swiss, Dutch and English, we find here, besides Catholics, Quakers, Calvinists, Lutherans, Methodists, Menists, Moravians, Independents, Anabaptists, and Shakers ; this being a sect of German origin, who live in religious society, and wear the habit of friars. Nor is it unworthy of our admiration to see how, in such a diversity of nations, tongues, and faiths, so great and universal harmony prevails ; and notwithstanding that each is aware, in his own mind, of the other's error, and even some times endeavours to convince him of it, yet does not this even endanger, if not that christian unity of faith, that religious fraternity which is observed to prevail. Again, the Quakers, the founders of this colony, have never been seen to exercise any conspicuous authority, save in the case of one William Keith, whom they seized and banished from the province as a disturber of the peace : but he, who was before a minister of the protestant church, turned Quaker, and then returned to his former ministry, rnaking such innovations with regard to the Quakers' -creed as to have given rise to great domestic troubles. The fertility of this province is such as to afford naturally, and with very little cultivation, an infinite variety of trees, flowers, plants, and fruits. It also abounds greatly in cattle, and the rivers are stocked with fish. Before the disturbances with England, and the war which gave rise to its independence, 25 vessels were built  here annually for the export of its productions, namely, skins, iron, fruits, &c. to the amount of £750,000 ; and there were goods imported from England to the amount of £611,000. The capital is Philadelphia. 
[The revolution which affected the whole of the United States, seems to have been felt by none of them more strongly than Pennsylvania. The above information we believe to be a correct view of its situation at the time described by our author, but its whole political and physical energies have been within the last SO years so completely enlarged, that we shall not fear entering into some degree of repetition by endeavouring to afford a true picture of its present state. 
Pennsylvania (except the purchase mentioned below) lies in the form of a parallelogram. The n. w. corner of this state, containing about 202,000 acres, was lately purchased of Congress by this state. Pennsylvania at present contains 44,900 square miles, and is divided into 23 counties, viz.  
Philadelphia, 
Chester, 
Delaware, 
Bucks, 
Montgomery, 
Berks, 
Lancaster, 
Dauphin, 
Northampton, 
Luzerne, 
York,  
Northumberland, 
Franklin, 
Bedford, 
Huntingdon, 
Mifflin, 
Westmoreland, 
Somerset, 
Fayette, 
Washington, 
Alleghany, 
Lycoming.  
Cumberland, 
These are subdivided into townships, not by any special law of the legislature, but on application of a sufficient number of the citizens, in any neighbourhood, to the judges of the court of Common Pleas and general quarter sessions of the county. In each township the citizens have the privilege of assembling once a year, to choose two overseers of the poor, two assessors, a collector of taxes, two supervisors of the roads, and a constable. The number of inhabitants, according to the census of 1790, was 434,373, including 3737 slaves, and by that of 1810, the total population amounted to 810,163 souls. But the emigration of foreigners has ever been, and continues to be, so considerable, that the number will always be far greater than could be expected from the natural increase of population. 
There are six considerable rivers, which, with their numerous branches, peninsulate the whole state, viz. The Delaware, Schuilkill, Susquehannah, Youghiogany, Monongahela, andAUeg-3  

PENNSYLVANIA.  fhany. The bay and river Delaware are navigable up to the Great or Lower Falls at Trenton, 155 miles from the sea, and a ship of the line can ascend to Philadelphia, the metropolis, 120 miles from the sea, by the ship channel of the Delaware. 
A considerable part of the state may be called mountainous ; particularly the countries of Bedford, Huntingdon, Cumberland, part of Franklin, Dauphin, and part of Bucks and Northampton, through which pass, under various names, the numerous ridges and spurs which collectively form the great range of Alleghany mountains. The principal ridges here are the Kittatinny, or Blue mountains, which pass n. of Nazareth in Northampton county, and pursue a s. w. course across the Lehigh, through Dauphin county, just above Harisburg, thence on the w. side of the Susquehannah, through Cumberland and Franklin counties. Back of these, and nearly parallel with them, are Peter's, Tuscarora, and Nescopek mountains, on the e. side of the Susquehannah ; and on the w., Shareman's hills, Sideling hills, Ragged, Great Warriors, Evits and Wills mountains ; then the great Alleghany ridge ; a?, of this are the Chesnut ridges. Between the Juniatta and the w. branch of the Susquehannah are Jack's, Tussy's, Nitting, and Bald-Eagle mountains. The vales between these mountains are generally of a rich, black soil, suited to the various kinds of grain and grass. Some of the mountains will admit of cultivation almost to their tops. The other parts of the state are generally level, or agreeably variegated with hills and valleys. 
The soil of Pennsylvania is of various kinds ; in some parts it is barren, but a great proportion of the state is good land ; and no inconsiderable part of it is very good. The richest track that is settled, is Lancaster county, and the valley through Cumberland, York, and Franklin. The richest that is unsettled, is between Alleghany river and lake Erie, in the n.w. part of the state, and in the country on the heads of the e. branches of the Alleghany. Pennsylvania includes the greater part of the kinds of trees, shrubs, and plants, that grow within the United States. Oaks, of several species, form the bulk of the wood. Hickory and walnut make a greater proportion than in the s. tates. Sassafras, mulberry, tuliptree, and cedar, are common, and grow to perfection. The magnolia glauca, or swamp -sassafras^ are found in low grounds ; the twigs and roots are used both in bath and decoction for removing the rheumatism . The magnolia acuminata., or cucum-  bertree, grows very tall about the w. mountains. The magnolia tripetala, or umbrellatree, is found in some parts 16 or 20 feet high. The bark is smooth, and the leaves sometimes exceed 12 or 15 inches in length, and five or six in breadth, terminating in a point at each extremity. The leaves are placed at the ends of the branches, in a circular form, resembling an umbrella ; hence the name. The bark of the tuliptree is esteemed a tolerable substitute for the Peruvian bark ; but the cornus Jlorida, or dogwood, which is frequent in the state, is preferred. Besides many other valuable trees and shrubs, are the several species of maple ; of these the scarletflowered and sugar maple are the most useful ; they are common in the n. and w. parts of the state, and are larger than the other species, growing from 50 to 60 feet high, and yield abundance of sap for the making of sugar. The ashleaved toothach tree, is found here and in Maryland. The bark and capsules have an acid taste, and are used in relieving the toothach, Whence it has got its name. The shrubby bithwort grows near Fort Pitt. It thrives in the shade, in a rich soil ; grows about 30 feet high, and sends off many twining branches. The roots have a lively aromatic taste, and are thought to have equal medicinal virtue to the small Virginia snakeroot. The sambucus canadensis, or redberried elder, is found here. Among the Indians it is called feverbush ; and a decoction of its wood and buds is highly esteemed by them. It would be endless to describe the beautiful flowering shrubs, and useful as also ornamental plants in this state. Grapes of several sorts are common : the late kind, when mellowed by frost, make, with the addition of sugar, good wine. At present, the cultivation of the vine is much in vogue in Pennsylvania, and good wine has been already made. 
Iron ore abounds in this state : copper, lead, and alum appear in some places. Limestone is common, as also several kinds of marble. In the middle and w. country is abundance of coal. At the head of the w. branch of Susquehannah is an extensive bed, which stretches over the country s. w. so as to be found in the greatest plenty about Pittsburg. There are also considerable bodies on the head waters of the Schuilkill and Lehigh ; and at Wyoming there is a bed open, which gives very intense heat. 
Useful quadrupeds, in the new districts, are deer, in great numbers, beavers, otters, racoons, and martins. Buffaloes rarely cross the Ohio, and elks seldom advance from the n. Panthers,*]

[wild cats, bears, foxes, and wolves are not rare ; the last do most mischief, especially in the winter ; but the fur and skins of all are valuable. In the thick settlements, rabbits and squirrels are frequent ; also minks and muskrats in marshes : partridges are yet numerous, though the late hard winters have destroyed many, and wild turkeys in the new settlements ; pheasants and  grouse are become scarce ; pigeons.  ducks, and  wild geese are generally found in plenty in their proper seasons. Here are a great number of singing birds, as many migrate to the state from n. and s. in certain seasons. 
Trout are common in the rivulets, in length seldom above a foot. In the e. rivers, the principal fish are rock and sheep'shead, with shad and herring, which in the spring come up from th,e sea in great shoals. These are not found in the w. waters, which are said to have their own valuable kinds, especially a species of catfish, weighing from 50 to 100 pounds ; yellow perch and pike are also in them much larger and more numerous. 
The 5. side of Pennsylvania is the best settled throughout, owing entirely to the circumstance of the w. road having been run by the armies, prior to 1762, through the towns of Lancaster, Carlisle and Bedford, and thence to Pittsburg. For the purpose of turning the tide of settlers from this old channel into the unsettled parts of the state, the government and landed interest of Pennsylvania have been, and are still, busy in cutting convenient roads. During the summer of 1788, they laid out a road .ft. from the former roads beyond Bethlehem, to the n. portage between Delaware and Susquehannah ; and thence n. 80° w. to the mouth of the Tioga, the former 70 miles, and the latter above 60. It has been in contemplation to cut a road from Sun bury, at the forks of the e. and w. branches of Susquehannah, w. 150 miles, to the mouth of Toby's Creek, which empties into the Alleghany from the e. but we are not enabled to say whether the plan may have taken effect. A road is also cut from the mouth of the Tioga, s. to the mouth of Loyal, which empties into the w. branch of Susquehannah. Another road is cut from Huntingdon town, on Frank's town branch of the Juniatta, w. 30 miles to Conemagh, a navigable branch of the Alleghany. A turnpike road has been lately completed from Philadelphia to Lancaster, which shortens the distance between these places eight miles ; and others are in contemplation. From Swetara to the Tulpehoken  branch of the Schuilkill, a canal and lock navigation is undertaken, and the works commenced, by an incorporated company, whose capital is 400,000 dollars. This leads through the Schuilkill to Philadelphia. By this means, it was proposed to open a passage to Philadelphia from the Juniatta, the Tioga, and the e. and w. branches of the Susquehannah, which water at least 15,000,000 of acres. From this junction, the general course of the Susquehannah is about*, e. until it falls into the head of Chesapeak Bay at Havre de Grace. See Tioga River. On the completion of the present plans, the state will be as conveniently intersected by roads as any other of its size in the Union, which will greatly facilitate the settlement of its new lands. A slight view of the map of Pennsylvania will best show how finely this state is situated for inland navigation. Nature has done so much for inland landcarriage, that although Philadelphia and lake Erie are distant from each other above 300 miles, there is no doubt but that the rivers of the state may be so improved, as to reduce the land carriage between them ninetenths. In the same way the navigation to Pittsburg, after due improvement, may be used instead of landcarriage for the whole distance, except 23 miles. By these routes it is clear, that a large proportion of the foreign articles used on the w. waters must be transported, and their furs, skins, ginseng, hemp, flax, potash, and other commodities brought to Philadelphia. 
Pennsylvania has the various kinds of grain, &c. common to the neighbouring states, but wheat is the principal grain of very general cultivation. In the year 1786, the exports of flour were 150,000 barrels; in 1789— 369,618 barrels ; and much greater quantities in years since. 
The manufactures of this state are of numerous kinds. Iron works are of long standing, and their products increase in quantity, and improve in quality. The furnaces are 16, and the forges 37. There are 18 rolling and slitting mills, which are said to cut and roll 150 tons a year. The forges will, it is thought, if properly conducted, manufacture each 170 tons of bar iron a year— total 6290 tons. Beside pigs cast at the furnaces, there are pots, kettles, pans, ovens, ladles, tongs, shovels, and irons, ploughirons, spades, hoes, sheetiron, hoops ; iron and steelwork for pleasure and working carriages, nails, bolts, spikes ; various ironwork for ships, mills and buildings, cannonballs, and some muskets ; scythes, sickles, axes, drawingknives, some saws]  

PENNSYLVANIA.  j and planes, and other tools. The other extensive manufactures are numerous, viz. those of leather, skins and fur, wood, paper, gunpowder, bricks, earthenware, copper, lead, tinwares, pewter, cotton, sugar, molasses, tobacco, &c. &c. There are 52 papermills in the state ; and their annual product is computed at 25,000 dollars. Since the year 1770, 25 gunpowder mills have been erected. There are about 300,000 wool and fur hats manufactured annually in the state ; nearly one half of which are of fur. In the manufacture of iron, paper, pleasure carriages, and cabinet work, Pennsylvania exceeds not only New York, but all her sister states. Much cotton is worked up in families ; and imported linen is now printed, in an increasing degree. The manufactures of Pennsylvania have greatly increased within a few years, as well by master workmen and journeymen from abroad, as by the skill and industry of the natives. Some persons have begun to press oil from hickory nuts. The Messrs. Marshalls of Philadelphia have commenced the making of Glauber's salt, sal ammoniac, and volatile salts ; they already supply the whole Union with the first article, and export a part of the others. A mill of Rumsay's (the improvement of Barker's) near that city, grinds, by water, flour, chocolate, snuff, hairpowder, and mustard ; shells chocolate nuts ; presses tobacco for chewing and smoaking ; and bolts meal. The waterworks near the falls of Trenton, which grind grain, roll and slit iron, and pound plaster of Paris, exhibit great mechanism. Card manufactories are lately set up. The hand machines for carding and spinning cotton have been introduced and improved. Sir Richard Arkwright's famous watermill for spinning cotton yarn has been obtained ; also the machinery to sliver, rove, and spin flax and hemp into thread, fit for linen of 30 cuts to the pound ; which will also serve for the roving and spinning combed wool into worsted yarn. Screws for papermills are now cut from solid cast iron. Lanterns for lighthouses are made by Mr. Wheeler of Philadelphia ; who also executes work for sugarmills in the W. Indies : during the war he made cannon from wrought iron. 
The commerce of Pennsylvania with the e. and s. states is, in great part, an exchange of staple commodities. Wheat flour and bariron are exported to New England for whale oil and bone, spermaceti, sealskms, mackerel, cod fish, and salmon ; to Rhode Island and Connecticut, cheese ; to S. Carolina and Georgia for liveoak, cedar, 

VOL, IV.  cotton, rice, and indigo; to N. Carolina for tar, pitch, turpentine, and lumber. Much of the trade with the S. states arises from the superiority of Pennsylvania in manufactures and commerce. Great quantities of deerskins, with those of otters, racoons, foxes, muskrats, and beavers, are imported from the back country. Virginia sends a great deal of wheat and unmanufactured tobacco. In return, she receives many articles of clothing, furniture, farming utensils, equipage; some E. India and European goods ; and even W. India produce ; of all these, more or less, according to the local improvement and situation. Hats, saddlery, shoes, Windsor chairs, carriages, hewn stones, iron castings for domestic use, wheel tire, spades, hoes, axes, paper, books, tinware, and brushes, constitute a great proportion of the exports to the s. Numerous droves of lean cattle come from the w. parts of these states, where they have a wide range, but want meadow. Virginia sends of late a considerable deal of coal, some lead, and peach brandy. This liquor also comes from Maryland ; but from both in quantity very small, considering the profit, and the facility of raising the fruit. The e. shore of Maryland sends to Philadelphia considerable quantities of wheat and Indian corn : from the w. comes the kitefoot tobacco. This state has also some trade with the s. of Pennsylvania, by the way of Chesapeak Bay ; some parts of it receive the same commodities as Virginia, especially pleasure carriages. The trade with New York depends chiefly on the fluctuation of the market ; American and foreign goods, of the same kinds, are carried between the two capital cities, as their prices fall and rise. Albany peas and crawfish are, however, articles in regular demand from New York. Great part of New Jersey and Delaware state have, as neighbours, much intercourse with Pennsylvania. The first supports in a great measure the market of Philadelphia, furnishes ryemeal, much Indian corn and lumber, and some iron bloomery : the other sends great quantities of excellent flour from the mills of Brandy wine, lumber from the district on the bay, and fat cattle from the pastures adjoining Delaware. Many of these, and of those fattened in the vicinity of Philadelphia, are brought from the s. ; and also from the countries on the n. and Connecticut Rivers, as far as Vermont and Massachusetts. 
The commerce of Pennsylvania, in the w. is by the Ohio with the Spanish, and by the lakes with the British, dominions ; and both ways with the]  m  

PENNSYLVANIA.  
[Indian tribes. This trade will probably be considerable, since commercial stipulations are formed with those powers, and peace is eoncluded with the Indians. At present nearly the whole foreign commerce is carried on by the port of Philadelphia. Its distance from the sea, and its closing by ice in the winter, are disadvantageous ; but the first is lessened by improved pilotage ; the other by the construction of the piers below, and by the occasional thaws which permit vessels to clear their way during the winter. In common seasons the navigation is obstructed six weeks ; a shorter period is as probable as a longer ; though, in the late hard winters, loads of wood have passed the river, near the city, in the first days of March. 
The population of this state has been already - mentioned ; it is nearly 20 for every square mile. The number of militia is estimated at upwards of 90,000, between 18 and 53 years of age. The inhabitants are principally the descendants of English, Irish, and Germans, with some Scotch, Welsh, Swedes, and a few Dutch. There are also many of the Irish and Germans who emigrated when young or middle aged. The Friends and Episcopalians are chiefly of English extraction, and compose about onethird of the inhabitants. They live chiefly in the metropolis, and in the count'es of Chester, Philadelphia, Bucks, and Montgomery. The Irish are mostly Presbyterians, but some are Roman Catholics : their ancestors came from the n. of Ireland, which was latterly settled from Scotland; hence they have been sometimes called Scotch Irish, to denote their double descent. They inhabit the w. and frontier countries, and are numerous. The Germans composed about one quarter of the inhabitants of Pennsylvania. They are most numerous in the n. parts of the metropolis, and the counties of Philadelphia, Montgomery, Bucks, Dauphin, Lancaster, York, andNorthampton; mostly in the four last, and are spreading in other parts. They consist of Lutherans (who are the most numerous sect), Calvinists, or Reformed Church, Moravians, Roman Catholics, Mennonists, Tunkers, and Zwingfelters, who are a species of Quakers. These are ail distinguished for their temperance, industry, and economy. The Baptists, except the Mennonists and Tunker Baptists, who are Germans, are chiefly descended of emigrants from Wales, and are not numerous. A proportionate assemblage of the national prejudices, the manners, customs, religions, and political sentiments of all these, will, form the Pennsylvania!! character.  
The number of congregations in the state is as follows : Presbyterians, 86 ; German Calvinists, 84 ; nearly 84 of German Lutherans ; Friends or Quakers, 54 ; Episcopalians, 26 ; Baptists, 15 ; Roman Catholics, 1 1 ; Scotch Presbyterians, 8 ; Moravians, 8 ; Free Quakers, 1 ; Universalists, 1 ; Covenanters, 1 ; Methodists, 3 or 4 ; and a Jewish Synagogue ; the whole amounting to 384. The literary, humane, and other useful societies, are more numerous and flourishing in Pennsylvania than in any of the 16 states. The seminaries of learning are respectable. There is an university at Philadelphia, and colleges at Carlisle and Lancaster. The Episcopalians have an academy at Yorktown in York county. There are also academies at Germantown, at Pittsburg, at Washington, at Allen's-Town, and other places ; these are endowed by donations from the legislature, and by liberal contributions of individuals. The legislature have also reserved 60,000 acres of the public lands for the public schools. The United Brethren, or Moravians, have academies at Bethlehem and Nazareth, on the best establishment of any schools perhaps in America. Besides Philadelphia, the metropolis, the chief towns are Lancaster, the largest inland town of the United States, Carlisle, Pittsburg, Sunbury, Bethlehem, Reading, Yorktown, Harrisburg, Washington, &c. 
The first frame of government for Pennsylvania is dated in 1682. By this form, all legislative powers were vested in the governor and freemen of the province, in the provincial council, and a general assembly. The council was to consist of 72 members, chosen by the freemen ; of which the governor, or his deputy, was perpetual president, with a treble vote. One third of this council went out of office every year, and their seats were supplied by new elections. 
The general assembly was at first to consist of all the freemen, afterwards of 200, and never to exceed 500. 
In 1683 Mr. Penn offered another frame of government, in which the number of representatives was reduced, and the governor vested with a negative upon all bills passed in assembly. By several specious arguments the people were persuaded to accept this frame of government. 
Not long after, a dispute between Mr. Penn and Lord Baltimore required the former to go to England, and he committed the administration of government to five commissioners taken from the council. In 1686 Mr. Penn required the commissioners to dissolve the frame of government ; but not being able to effect his purpose, he, in]  

PENNSYLVANIA.  ("1688, appointed Captain John Blackwell his deputy. From this period the proprietors usually resided in England, and administered the government by deputies, who were devoted to their interest. Jealousies arose between the people and their governors, which never ceased till the late revolution. The primary cause of these jealousies was an attempt of the proprietary to extend his own power, and abridge that of the assembly ; and the consequence was, incessant disputes and dissensions in the legislature. 
In 1689, Governor Blackwell, finding himself opposed in his views, had recourse to artifice, and prevailed on certain members of the council to withdraw themselves from the house ; thus defeating the measures of the legislature. Two instances of a secession of members from the assembly, with similar views, have taken place since the revolution, and seem to have been copied from the example in 1689. 
In 1693, the king and queen assumed the government into their own hands. Colonel Fletcher was appointed governor of New York and Pennsylvania by one and the same commission, with equal powers in both provinces. By this commission, the number of counsellors in Pennsylvania was reduced. 
Under the administration of Governor Markham in 1696, a new form of government was established in Pennsylvania. The election of the council and assembly now became annual, and the legislature, with their powers and forms of proceeding, was new modelled. 
In 1699, the proprietary arrived from England, and assumed the reins of government. While he remained in Pennsylvania, the last charter of privileges, or frame of government, which continued till the revolution, was agreed upon and established. This was completed and delivered to the people by the proprietary, October 28, 1701, just on his embarking for England. The inhabitants of the Territory, as it was then called, or the lower counties, refused to accept this charter, and thus separated themselves from the province of Pennsylvania. They afterwards had their own assembly, in which the governor of Pennsylvania used to preside. 
In September 1700, the Susquehannah Indians granted to Mr. Penn all their lands on both sides the river. The Susquehannah, Shawanese, and Patomak Indians, however, entered into articles of agreement with Mr. Penn, by which, on certain conditions of peaceable and friendly behaviour, they were permitted to settle about the  head of Patomak, in the province of Pennsylvania. The Conostoga chiefs also in 1701 ratified the grant of the Susquehannah Indians made the preceding year. 
In 1708, Mr. Penn obtained from the Sachems of the country, a confirmation of the grants made by former Indians, of all the lands from Duck Creek to the mountains, and from the Delaware to the Susquehannah. In this deed, the Sachems declared that "they had seen and heard read divers prior deeds, which had been given to Mi% Penn by former chiefs." 
While Mr. Penn was in America, he erected Philadelphia into a corporation. The charter was dated October 25, 1701, by which the police of the city was vested in a mayor, recorder, aldermen, and common council, with power to inquire into treasons, murders, and other felonies ; and to inquire into and punish smaller crimes. The corporation had also extensive civil jurisdiction; but it was dissolved at the late revolution, and Philadelphia was governed like other counties in the state, till 1789, when it was again incorporated. 
By the favourable terms which Mr. Penn offered to settlers, and an unlimited toleration of all religious denominations, the population of the province was extremely rapid. Notwithstanding the attempts of the proprietary or his governors to extend his own power, and accumulate property by procuringgrants from the people, and exempting his lands from taxation, the government was. generally mild, and the burdens of the people by no means oppressive. The selfish designs of the proprietaries were vigorously and constantly opposed by the assembly, whose firmness preserved the charter rights of the province. 
At the revolution, the government was abolished. The proprietaries were absent, and the people, by their representatives, formed a new constitution on republican principles. The proprietaries were excluded from all share in the government, and the legislature offered them £ 130,000 in lieu of all quitrents, which was finally accepted. The proprietaries, however, still possess in Pennsylvania many large tracts of excellent land. 
It is to be regretted, that among all the able writers in this important state, none has yet gratified the public with its interesting history. 
The present constitution of this state was ratified June 12th, 1792. A convention, to amend the constitution, may be called where the ma-] o2   100

==[[Penobscot|PENOBSCOT|Pentaguet]]==, a river of the province of Sagadahock in N. America ; it rises from various lakes, runs s. w. and enters the sea in the bay of its name. [The noble river which empties its waters into that bay, is the most considerable in the district of Maine, and rises by two branches in the high lands. The e. branch passes through several smaller lakes. From the Forks, as they are called, the Penobscot Indians pass to Canada, up either branch, principally the w. the source of which, they say, is not more than 20 miles from  the waters which empty into the St. Lawrence. At the Forks is a remarkable high mountain ; from thence down to Indian Old Town, situated on an island in this river, is about 60 miles (that is to say, by water), 40 of which the water flows in a still smooth stream, and in the whole distance there are no falls to interrupt the passage of boats : in this distance the river widens, and embraces a great number of islands. About 60 rods below Indian Old Town are the Great Falls, where is a carryingplace of about 20 rods ; thence 12 miles to the head of the tide there are no falls to obstruct boats. Vessels of 30 tons come within a mile of the head of the tide.

The chief islands it encloses are Fox, Haut, Long, and Deer Islands, besides a number of small isles, rocks, and ledges. Through this bay to the mouth of the river of its name, the w. channel goes up by a headland on the w. called Owl's Head, and between Long Island on the w. and Cape Rosier on the e. to Bagaduce Point.

It stands just above the Great Falls, and consists of about 200 acres of land. See Indian Old Town. In a former war this tribe lost their lands ; but at the commencement of the last war, the Provincial Congress forbad any person settling on the lands from the head of the tide on Penobscot river, included in lines drawn six miles from the river on each side ; that is, a tract 12 miles wide, intersected by the middle of the river. They, however, consider that they have a right to hunt and fish as far as the mouth of the Bay of Penobscot extends. This was their original right, in opposition to any other tribe, and thej now occupy it.] 

==[[Penol|PENOL]]==, a city of Nuevo Mexico in N. America; founded by the Indians in a situation so strong and singular, as to be without its equal.

==[[Pernambuco|PERNAMBUCO]]==, a province and captainship of the kingdom of Brazil ; bounded n. and e. by the sea, s. by the captainship of Bahia, and w. by the province and government of Piauh. This captainshipgeneral of Pernambuco is about 470 miles in extent from n. to s. and about 370 from e. to w. and is irrigated by the rivers Tapados, Bibiribe, Camuri, Cenebi, Periperi, S. Miguel, Cururui, Vazabazas, S. Francisco, Inaya, Galiole, Parachuy, Parapinzingua, Poyuca, and many others. It abounds greatly in sugarcane, cotton, and Brazilwood, in the which its chief commerce consists ; as also in sugar, which it manufactures in great quantities, and sends to Portugal. The climate of this province is for the most part hot, and in the interior of the country moist, on account of the waters which become stagnant, as unable to pass through the thickness of the woods. 
The king, Don Juan III. of Portugal, gave this territory as a property to Don Duarte Coello Pereyra, third son of Gonzalo Pirez Coello, Lord of Filgueiras, for the great services he had performed in India. He arrived here accompanied with many noble families, with a great store of arms, provisions, and necessaries ; but finding an extraordinary resistance on the part of the barbarian Cahetes Indians, who had the dominion of that whole country as far as the river of S. Francisco, being aided by some French, he was forced to dispute that ground inch by inch which had been granted to him by leagues ; and in one of the encounters he was badly wounded : but he, nevertheless, kept on acquiring greater portions of territory by degrees, | and founded different settlements; whither, allured  
S. Antonio, S. Miguel, Alagoas del Sur, Penedo.  by his generosity and the fertility of the country, many Portugueze of noble and opulent families came to establish themselves ; and who have left descendants who shed a lustre on their forefathers. 
The Dutch invaded and took possession of this province in 1630, keeping it till 1632, when it was recovered by the Portugueze. The male line of its first possessor having been extinct, this province was added to the crown. The capital is the city of Olinda, which has also the name of Pernambuco ; and the other settlements of which it is composed are the towns of 
S. Cosme and S. Da- Alagoas del Norte, mian, or Igarazii, 
Serinhaem, or Villahermosa, 
Puerto Calvo, 
[Pernambuco (says Mr. Grant) formerly contained above a hundred sugar plantations, extensive forests, wellcultivated fields, and a great profusion of the most delicious fruits. It formerly produced, at every return, more than 15,000 chests of sugar, but at present it scarcely furnishes 4000. 
The population of this province was, several years ago, including Negroes, people of colour, and Indians, estimated at about 90,000; but since this period many families have emigrated to Paraguay, Peru, and Chile. This emigration has principally arisen from the embarrassments occasioned by the debts with which this province is loaded. The settlement of Penedo, situate on the n. shore of the river St. Francis, terminates this province to the s. as the island of Tamaraca terminates it on the n. The entrance into the sea by the said river St. Francis, is well defended by the fort of S. Mauricius, which the Portuguese have had the precaution to build in the vicinity. 
The island of Fernando de Noronha, which lies at the distance of 50 leagues from the coast of Pernambuco, is nevertheless included under the jurisdiction of this captainship. The Portugueze, after having for many years deserted this island, returned to it in 1738; and, under the persuasion that the French East India Company intended to take possession of it, erected seven strong forts for its defence. These forts are provided with artillery, and garrisoned with regulartroops, which are relieved every six months. 
A few exiles, a small number of indigent Mustees, and the Indians employed on the public works, compose the whole of the inhabitants of this island. No kind of plantations have ever succeeded, though the soil is good, on account : e;2.„  PER  of the dryness of the climate ; whole years frequently elapsing without any rain. 
From December till April turtles constitute the only food of the inhabitants ; after this period they disappear, and leave them solely dependent on the provisions sent from the continent. 
There are two very good harbours in the island, Where ships of any size may ride in safety, except during the prevalence of n. and ay. winds. See Index to additional matter respecting the history of Brazil, cap. i.]

==[[Perote|PEROTE]]==, a head settlement of the district of the alcadia mayor of Xicayan in Nueva Espana. It is of a cold and dry temperature, from the soil being sandy, but enjoys a pleasant and salutary air : although this is hindered from blowing from the s. e. by the great mountain, called Cofre de Perote, one of the loftiest in that kingdom, and which is discovered more than 20 leagues at sea, being nearly of the same height with the volcano of Orizaba, and both of them serving as a landmark to make the port of Vera Cruz. The expansion of its skirts are equal to its height ; since it extends from n. to s. for upwards of six leagues, all of which are of serranias, and from which flow down many streams, forming at some of the tops various lakes, which remain the whole year round. This mountain is covered with firs and other trees of immense size, and principally with sabins, from which they cut very large and thick planks. But the greatest advantage made of this tree is when they distil it over a fire and extract a great quantity of tar, which is carried to Vera Cruz for careening vessels. On the  skirts of this mountain graze infinite numbers of large and small cattle ; since it is, in every part, fertile, pleasant, and abounding in pasture. The population of the settlement is composed of 86 families of Spaniards, 46 of Muslees, SO of Mulattoes, and 27 of Indians, who speak the Castillian idiom with the same perfection as the Spaniards. It has a convent of the religious of the order of La Caridad, with the dedicatory title of San Hipolito. These are dedicated to give hospitality to poor Europeans who arrive in the fleets which pass by here ; curing such as are sick, and exercising themselves in works of piety. The expense of this laudable establishment is defrayed by five cultivated estates, and 1 1 ranchos in its district. Ten leagues n. of its capital.

It is in a most beautiful situation, namely, at the mouth of the river Raritan, which here forms at its entrance into the sea a large and handsome bay, capable of containing 500 vessels. But with all these advantages the town has flourished but moderately, since it consists of only 40 small houses besides the governor's. The plan which was formed by the "Scotch was very grand, and they laid out 1070 acres of ground, divided into equal parts for purchasers to build on, reserving four acres for a public market, and three for storehouses, which, if they had been finished, according to the projection, would have vied with any of the finest cities in N. America. [This city lies open to Sandy Hook, and has one of the best harbours on the continent. Vessels from sea may enter it on one side, in almost any weather. It is a port of entry and posttown ; but although it is admirably situated for trade, and the legislature has given every encouragement to induce merchants to settle here, it is far from being in a flourishing state. It now contains about 60 houses, and carries on a small trade to the W. Indies. Its exports for a year, ending September 30, 1794, were to the value of 58,159 dollars.

==[[Peru|PERU]]==, an extensive kingdom or empire o>: S. America, anciently governed by its own sovereigns, and now subject to the king of Spain, who sends thither a viceroy. It was discovered by Francisco PLzarro, Marquis of Los Charcas and Atavillos, in 1526, in the reign of the emperor Atahuallpa, whom some improperly called Atabaliba. This same discoverer began its conquest in 1531. It was formerly called Biru, from the name of a cacique, or prince, of one of its states on the coast of the Pacific. Some assert that the word Peru comes from Beru, a river which enters itself into that sea, and which was the first passed by the same Pizarro. Others give its origin from a promontory of the same coast, which at that time was called Pelu. The limits of this kingdom have been various, according to the difference of the governments. At present its jurisdiction extends to the three audiences of Lima, Charcas, and Chile ; separating that of Quito, which is dependent upon the government of the viceroyalty of Santa Fe de Bogota, both in ecclesiastical and temporal concerns. The government of Peru begins from the Gulf of Guayaquil to the s., that is, at Cape Blanco, and from the corregimiento of Truxillo, which extends as far as Tumbez, in lat. 3° 25 / s. as far as the Desert of Atacama, the n. boundary of the kingdom of Chile. It is thus 432 leagues in length from n. to s. and comprehending the kingdom of Chile as far as the lands of Magellan, that is, as far as lat. 57° s. Its measure from pole to pole is upwards of 1069 leagues. It has for limits on the e. the mountains which divide it from the kingdom of Brazil, on the celebrated line called Of Demarcation, or Alexandrian, drawn by Pope Alexander VI., determining the extent of the empire between the Spaniards and Portuguese of the new world. It is bounded w. by the Pacific or S. Sea, and its greatest extent here is 558 leagues. 
The ancient Indians called this country lavantinsuyu, which signifies, the four parts.— That of the e. in which is the imperial city of Cuzco, they called Collasuyu, or eastern part of the empire ; that of the w. Chinchaysuyu ; that of the n. Antisuyu ; and that of the s. Contisuyu. This great country is divided into 96 provinces, in the district of the three aforefaid audiences ; and as to its spiritual and ecclesiastical concerns into an archbishopric and 11 bishoprics. The proper language of the natives is the Que-  ls'

The ancient religion of Peru was the idolatrous worship of the sun, from which they thought that their emperors, the Incas, were descended. They acknowledged and adored an invisible and supreme being, whom they called Pachacamac, that is, creator and preserver of the universe. The founder of the monarchy of Peru was Manco Capac, in company with Mama Ocllo his sister ; and this empire remained for a series of 17 Incas monarchs, until the reign of Sayri- Tupac, who was the last; and renounced the throne to the king of Spain, embracing the Catholic religion, and taking the name of Diego Sayri-Tupac-Inca. 
This empire is peopled with many barbarous nations, who live in the woods and on the mountains like wild beasts. Many of them have embraced the Catholic faith, and have become reduced to a civilized state of life in the cities and

Ill  settlements which have been founded by the Spaniards. They are robust, pacific, and kind : their predominant vice is drunkenness ; but they are ingenious and easily imitate whatever they see. Since the conquest, the Spaniards have been established amongst them, and the descendants of these they call Creoles and Peruleros, a race at once clever, valorous, and docile, of fine temper, excellent understanding, and greatly attached to strangers : but they have been without instruction or reward ; or they would otherwise have made the greatest progress in literature, and carried the arts in this country to the highest pitch ; since, under all their disadvantages, there have not been wanting amongst them, men who have excelled in arms and letters. 
The European Spaniards are called Chapetones, and are nearly all devoted to commercial pursuits. Some established themselves here, and formed new families ; whilst others, after having made their fortunes, with great fatigues and perils by land and sea, returned to Europe. The English, French, and Dutch, have attempted several times to establish themselves in Peru ; but their views have always been defeated by the Spanish government, who were aware of the immense treasures they derived from it in gold, silver, jewels, quicksilver, copper, dyes, woods, balsams, spices, zarzaparilla, bat/nilla, bark, cacao, and a thousand other drugs and productions, not to mention animals, fruits, birds, and fish, in which a regular account will be given in each of the articles of the 98 provinces and corregimientos or governments into which this kingdom is divided, and which are as follows :

The archbishopric of Lima has for suffragan the bishops of Cuzco, Santiago de Chile, Concepcion de Chile, Guamanca, Arequipa, Truxillo, Quito, and Panama ; and the archbishopric of La Plata those of La Paz, Santa Cruz dela Sierra, Buenos Ayres, Tucuman, and Paraguay. This vast empire is governed by a viceroy, who resides at Lima, this being the capital and metropolis. He has the title of governor and captaingeneral of all the kingdoms and provinces of Peru, and is president of the royal audience and chancery of Lima ; this being the authority on which depend the other magistracies and tribunals, civil and criminal. The provinces are governed, some by governors, and others by corregidors nominated by the king, and in some settlements there remain the old caciques, or Indian governors, though under subordination to the former powers. The Indians pay an annual tribute to the king, the which is more moderate with regard to such as voluntarily acknowledged their obedience, and proportionably larger to those who were subjected by force of arms : and, again, there are some entirely free from this exaction, namely, those who are descendants of the first allies of the Spaniards, and who assisted them in their conquests.

1. Climate, Soil, and Productions. — From the situation of this country, which is within the torrid zone, it is natural to suppose that it would be almost uninhabitable ; but the Andes Mountains being on the one side, and the S. Sea on the other, it is not so hot as tropical countries in general are ; and in some parts it is disagreeably cold. In one part are mountains of a stupendous height and magnitude, having their summits covered with snow ; on the other, volcanoes flaming within, while their summits, chasms, and apertures, are involved in ice. The plains are temperate, the beaches and vallies hot ; and lastly, according to the diposition of the country, its high or low situation, we find all the variety of gradations of temperature between the two extremes of heat and cold. It is remarkable that in some places it never rains, which defect is supplied by a dew that falls every night and sufficiently refreshes the vegetable creation ; but in Quito they have prodigious rains, attended by dreadful storms of thunder and lightning. In the inland parts of Peru, and by the banks of the rivers, the soil is usually very fertile ; but along the seacoast it is a barren sand. Vast numbers of cattle were imported by the Spaniards into Peru, when they took possession of that country; these are now so increased that they run wild, and are hunted like game. This country produces fruits peculiar to the climate, and most of those in Europe. The culture of maize, of pimento, and of cotton, which was found established there, has not been neglected ; and that of wheat, barley, cassava, potatoes, sugar, and of the olive and vine is attended to. The goat has thriven very well; but the sheep have degenerated, and their wool is become.extremely coarse. 
There are certain waters in this country which in their course turn into stone ; and fountains of liquid matter, called coppey, resembling pitch and tar, and used by seamen for the same purpose. On the coast of Guayaquil and Guate- Q

PERU.  mala are found a certain species of snails, which yield the purple dye so celebrated by the ancients, and which the moderns have supposed to have been lost. The shell that contains them is fixed to rocks watered by the sea. It is of the size of a large nut. Various methods are used to extract the purple matter from the animal. There is no colour that can be compared to this, either in lustre or permanence. 
Here is also found a new substance, called the platina, and which may be considered as an eighth metal. In its native state it is mixed with gold and iron, and this at first gave rise to a suspicion that it was nothing more than a combination of these two metals ; but late experiments of chemists fully prove, that it is a pure and simple metal, with properties peculiar to itself. It cannot be aifected by any simple acid, or by any known solvent, except the aqua regia; it will not tarnish in the air, neither will it rust ; it unites to the fixedness of gold, and to the property it has of not being susceptible of destruction, a hardness almost equal to that of iron, and a much greater difficulty of fusion. It is of an intermediate colour between that of iron and silver ; it can be forged and extended into thin plates ; and when dissolved in aqua regia, it may be made to assume, by precipitation, an infinite diversity of colours ; and Count Milby has succeeded in varying these precipitates so much, that he has a picture painted, in the colouring of which there is scarce any thing but platina made use of. Upon the whole, from considering the advantages of the platina, we cannot but conclude that this metal deserves, at least, from its superiority to all others, to share the title of king of metals, of which gold has so long been in possession. 
The Peruvian bark, so famous at present for curing intermittent fevers, is likewise found here. The tree from which it is taken grows upon the slope of mountains, and is about the size of a common cherry tree. It is distinguished into three kinds ; the red, yellow, and the white ; but the red is found to be the best and most efficacious. The Jesuits carried this bark to Rome as early as 1639 ; but the natives are supposed to have been acquainted with its medicinal qualities many ages before. 
2. Mines, Exports and Imports — In the n. parts of Peru are several gold mines ; but those of silver are found all over the country, particularly in the neighbourhood of Potosi. Nature never afforded to the avidity of mankind, in any country  on the globe, such rich mines as those of Potosi. These famous mines were accidentally discovered  
An Indian, deer,  some  in the year 1545, in this manner, named Hualpa, one day following which made directly up the hill of Potosi, came to a steep craggy part of the hill, and the better to enable him to climb up, laid hold of a shrub, which came up by the roots, and laid open a mass of silver ore. He for some time kept it a secret, but afterwards revealed it to his friend Guanca, who, because he would not discover to him the method of refining it, acquainted the Spaniard his master, named Valaroel, with the discovery. Valaroel registered the mine in 1545 ; and from that time till 1638 these mines of Potosi had yielded 95,619,000 pieces of eight, which is about 4,255,000 pieces a year. 
But the annual sum derived from these mines, according to the latest accounts, and as calculated from the produce of the royal duties, and therefore considerably under the truth, amounts to 3,400 Spanish marks of pure gold, and 513,000 ditto of pure silver. The value in dollars of both is 5,317,988 ; the gold being estimated at 145 -^ dollars, and the silver at 9 ^ dollars the Spanish mark. Besides this, we must add for contraband 922,012 dollars ; and the total produce will then be 6,240,000. 
The following comparison of the value of the exports of that kingdom to Europe, at different periods of the last century, will show the growth and improvement of its commerce.

According to Humboldt, the dollars imported into Peru and Chile in 1803, amounted to 11,500,000, and the exports consisted of produce to the value of 4,000,000 dollars, besides 8,000,000 dollars in specie. 
3. Population.— The population of Peru, in 1796, appears from the Viagero Universal and Alvear y Ponce, to amount in 1796, to 1,445,000 souls, and that of Chile to 720,000, in 1806. But Mr. Walton greatly exceeds this estimate, for he states the number of inhabitants in this viceroy - alty, in the year 1812, as follows :    PERU.  Indians, men, women and children - 2,846,351

Among all the inhabitants of Peru, pride and laziness are said to be the most predominant passions. Avarice may likewise be attributed to some of them with a great deal of propriety. There is very little commerce in this fine country, except in the cities and large towns, which are described under their respective names. The chief manufactures are carried on by the Indians ; these consist chiefly of leather, woollen and cotton stuffs, and earthen ware ; in the fabrication of which they are said to be peculiarly ingenious. The Indians and Negroes are forbidden, under the severest penalties, to intermarry ; for division between these two classes, is the greatest instrument, in which the Spaniards trust for the preservation of the colonies. Peru is governed by a viceroy, who is absolute ; but it being impossible for him to superintend the whole extent of his government, he delegates a part of his authority to the several audiences and courts, established at different places throughout his territories. At Lima there is a treasury court for receiving a fifth of the mines, and certain taxes paid by the Indians, which belong to the king of Spain. 
4. Revolutions. — About the year 1781, and the same period in which happened the revolution in Santa Fe ; an insurrection took place in this kingdom, under the direction of Tupac-Amaru, but which failed from the circumstance of this chief being so enraged against the Spaniards, and desirous of revenging his ancestors, as to have promulgated his resolution of extirpating every other race but the original one of the country ; when the Mustees, Mulattoes, and Creoles being more numerous and better informed than the Indians, united against them, and rendered the attempt abortive. 
But the seeds of revolution that have germinated in Mexico, Venezula and La Plata, have struck their roots deep in this kingdom, and  although we have not as yet seen the spirit of rebellion which has spread as it were by an electric impulse through the former dominions, manifest itself so frequently and with such violence in Peru, we are, nevertheless, not without sufficient documents to prove that the old government has need of all its energies, and even of submitting to some sacrifices to secure its power. 
On this subject the Buenos Ay res Gazette, of the 8th of May 1812, contains the following paragraph : — "It appears that the capital of the kingdom of Peru, alive to the glorious example of the other American provinces, now exhibits some symptoms of rousing itself from the lethargy to which the influence of the despots and their satellites had reduced it. In spite of the attempts to conceal from the Peruvians the desperate situation of the Peninsula, the truth begins to penetrate even into those remote countries ; and the day is not far distant when the people, undeceived, and no longer the subjects of delusion, will concur in supporting the great cause of the independence of the new world. On the 4th of March, Abascal, tired of striving against the current of our new system, offered at Lima to instal a junta, provided the presidency was secured to himself, and the expiring government of Cadiz recognized. This concession resulted from a commotion excited among the Mulatto militia, when they were ordered to march to the assistance of Goyoueche. From the above Gazette, it appeared also, that Goyoneche was at the head of 4000 men, and the province of Potosi, with the greater part of the country, still remained faithful in their adherence to the mother country. But the province of Cochabamba continued its connections with the Junta of Buenos Ayres, and was said to have a military force of 4000 men. What was called the auxiliary army of the Junta in that country is commanded by one Pueyredon, but its amount is not stated. See La Plata. 
5. Traits of the Religion of the Aborigines. — The chief god of the Peruvians was Wiracocha, by whom they understood the maker of all things ; next to him they worshipped the Sun, and after him, Thunder. The images of these three they never touched with their bare hands : they worshipped also the Stars, Earth, Sea, Rainbow, Rivers, Fountains, and Trees. They adored also wild beasts, that these might not hurt them; and as marks of devotion, when they travelled, they left in the crossways, and dangerous places, old shoes and feathers, and if they had nothing else, stones. They worshipped the Sun, by pulling off the hair from their eyebrows : q2    PERU.  
: »  when they were in fear, they would touch the Earth and look up to the Sun. They worshipped also the dead bodies of their Emperors, and indeed there was nothing so trifling, but it in some degree excited their fear and veneration. They have some glimmering knowledge of the beginning of the world and of Noah's flood, and they believe in the end of the world, which they are accustomed to dread, whenever the sun is eclipsed ; and this luminary they take to be the moon's husband. Their Priests they held in such esteem, that no great matter was undertaken, either by prince or people, without their advice. 
None, except themselves, had access to the Idols, and then only when they were clothed in white, and then they would prostrate themselves on the ground. In sacrificing they abstained from women ; and some out of zeal would put out their own eyes. They used to consult with the devil, to whom they sacrificed men, and dedicated boys in their temples for sodomy. They had also their temples richly adorned with gold and silver, and their monasteries for priests and sorcerers. Their nuns were so strictly kept, that it was death to be defloured. After 14 years of age they were taken out of the monastery, either to serve their idols (and such must be virgins still) or else to serve as wives and concubines to the Inca, or Emperor. They are very frequent and strict in their confessions, and cheerfully undertake what penance is enjoined them ; but the Inca used to confess only to the Sun ; after confession they all wash in baths, leaving their sins in the water. They used to sacrifice vegetables, animals, and men, chiefly children, for the health or prosperity of their Inca, and for victory in war. In some places they eat their mensacrifices, in others they only dried and preserved them in silver coffins. They anointed with blood the faces of their idols, and doors of their temples, or rather slaughterhouses. See Acosta, Cieza, Gomara, &c. 
. Peruvians, their festival days. — They had feasts and sacrifices every month of the year, in which were offered multitudes of sheep of different colours, which they burned. The Inca's children were dedicated in these feasts ; their ears were pierced, then they were wiped, and their faces anointed with blood, in sign that they should be true in their allegiance to their Inca. During the month of this latter festival, no stranger might remain in Cuzco, but at the end thereof they were admitted, and had a morsel of bread presented to each man, that they should by eating thereof testify their fidelity to the Inca. In the  second month, which is our January, (for December, in which the sun returns from capricorn, was their first month) they flung the ashes of their sacrifices into the river, following the same six leagues, and praying the river to cany that present to Viracocha. In the three following months, they offered 100 sheep ; in the 6th they offered 100 sheep more, and celebrated a feast for their maizeharvest ; in the 7th they sacrificed to the sun ; in the 8th and 9th month, 200 sheep were offered ; in the 10th 100 more ; and to the honour of the moon they burned torches, washed themselves, and then were drunk four days together ; in the 11th month they offered 100 sheep more, and upon a black sheep poured much chica or wine of maize to procure rain; in the 12th month they sacrificed 100 sheep and kept a feast. They had indeed many fasts, when they would continue in mourning and sad procession two days,andthe twodays after wouldbe spentin feasting, dancing, and drinking. See Jos. Acosta. 
Peruvians, their belief of the departed souls — They believed that the departed souls wandered up and down, and suffered hunger, thirst, and cold ; therefore they carried them meat, drink, and clothes. They used also to put gold and silver in their mouths, hands, and bosoms, and indeed much treasure has at times been dug out of their graves. They believed that the souls of good men were at rest in glory. The bodies were honoured after death ; sacrifices and garments were offered to them ; the bestbeloved wife was slain, and attendants of all sorts. To the Inca's ghost young children were sacrificed, and if the father was sick, they would commonly slay the son, thinking this murder should satisfy death for the father. Concerning these and other their impious ceremonies, see Acosta.

Chronological Series of the Inca-Emperors who have presided in Peru. 
L Manco-Inca was the first who reduced the barbarous Indians to a civilized life in 1100, according to Garcilaso de la Vega, and taught them arts and agriculture. He feigned himself to be son of the Sun, and sent from his father for the good of mankind ; in the establishing of which ideas, and also in the foundation of the monarchy itself, he was not a little aided by his sister and wife Mama Ocllo Huaco. The Indians received him as a deity, and gave him the name of Capac    PERU.  which signifies, Rich in virtue ; and they established the insignias of prince in his successors, oivin" - him to wear a turban, which was folded three times round the head with a red arrow pending in front. He made many humane and wise laws ; condemning as capital crimes homicide, adultery, and theft ; and he commanded that each should select his wife out of his own family, but never till he was 20 years of age. He proposed the adoration of the Sun as the first Divinity, and built to it a temple at Cuzco, and close to it a house for the virgins consecrated to that deity ; and these, it appears, should be of the royal blood, or descended of the Incas. His reign is thought to have lasted 40 years, and he left as his successor, 
2. Sinchi-Moca, firstborn of Manco-Capac : he succeeded to the empire of those barbarians, who had been civilized by his father, (the appellation Sinchi signifying Strong,) and he extended his dominion to the 5. of Cuzco for more than 60 miles, as far as the settlement called Chuncara, and e. as far as the shore of the river Cullahuaya, reducing all those nations to his obedience by mild and conciliatory measures. His wife's name was Mama-Cora; by her he had many "children, and left the government, at his death, to his firstborn, after a 29 j ears' reign. 
3. Lloque- Yupanqui, which first name signifies Lefthanded ; as he was accustomed to this fault, and the second signifyingprognosticator, alludingto the victories he foretold. He was the first who embodied an army. He subjected the Canes Indians, then the Ayaviris, and built a fortress called Pucara. He afterwards subjected the provinces of Paucar-Colla and Hatun-Colla, together with other settlements, and extended the empire as far as the channel or wastewater of the lake Titicaca to the 5. and as far as the cordillera of the mountains of the Andes to the w. His wife was Mama-Cava, who bare him no other male children than one, who succeeded him. He died at Cuzco, of age 93 years, of which he had reigned 34 years and seven months. 
4. Maita-Capac, who took the reins of the monarchy, through the death of his father, at the age of 51. He subjected the province of Tia- Huanaca, where he caused fine edifices to be constructed, and obliged, through his fame and reputation in conquests, the settlements of the province of Cocyaviri to acknowledge their allegiance ; as also, to follow their example, the Indians of the provinces of Cauquicura, Mallama, Huarina, Cuchuna, Laricaja, Sancavan, and Collas, though not till he had routed them in a battle  fought at the place called Huaichu. He thus extended his empire as far as Caracolla, and as the lake Paria to the s. and e. as far as the beautiful llanuras of Chuquiapu. He also included in his conquests to the w. the provinces of Chumbivillca, Allca, Taurisma, Cotahuahu, Pumatampu, and Parinacocha, and to the e. those of Aruni and Collahua. He had by his wife Mama- Cuca many sons, and died at 91 years of age, leaving his empire to his firstborn. 
5. Capac- Yupangui, who passed with his army the river Auprimac, subjected the nation of the Pitis, and afterwards that of the Aimaraes, in whose territory he caused the fortress of Patirca to be built. He was the first who entered Cuzco, the capital, in triumph. In another expedition he subjected the settlements called Quechuas in the province of Cotapampa and Catanera, and afterwards those of Amampallpa, Hacari, Ubiiia, Camana, Caravilli, Pieta, and Quelca. He then undertook other conquests, namely, those of the provinces of Tapacric and Cochapampa,Chayanta and Charcas, and, lastly, those of Curahuaci, Amancay, Sura, Apucara, Rucana and Hatun- Rucana ; and, towards the coast of the Pacific Sea, those of Nanasca, Mama and Curiyllpay. He reigned 41 years, and the crown, at his death, descended to his son. 
6. Inea-JRoca, (this name signifying Prudent Prince). His first plans of conquest were against Chinchasuya ; when he succeeded in rendering subject to him the nations of Tacmaras and Quinuallas, with the country of Cochacasa and Curampa. He was equally victorious over the Chancas and the nations of Hancohuallo, Utunsulla, Uramarca, and Villca. His second expedition, under the direction of his son Yahuarhuacac, brought under his dominion the settlements of Challapampa, Pillcupata, Havisca, and Tunu. The third, which consisted of an army of 30,000 men, made him master of the provinces of Chuncuri, Pucuna, Muyumuyu, Misqui, Sacaca, Machaca, and Characara. This prince was the first who founded schools for the princes of the blood royal, where they were instructed in the Quipus, which was a certain number of cords of various colours, full of different kinds of knots, and which served as writing. The annalist, or historian of the empire, who preserved them in, the temple of the Sun, was called Quipucans, or Keeper of the Quipus. He reigned 5 1 years, was married to Mamamicay, and succeeded by his son, 
7. Yahuar-Huacac, (meaning one that weeps blood). He succeeded to Inca Roca, and he had  PERU.    this name from its being said of him, that he wept blood from his nose. He entrusted to his brother Incamota the command of the armies, and conquered Collasuyu. Jealous of the ferocious and unquiet disposition of his eldest son, Inca- Rapac, he destined him to the employment of watching the cattle of the Temple of the Sun near Cuyco ; where it was that Viracocha-Inca, brother of Manco-Capac, had the famous vision, which revealed to him the i*ebellion which was engendered in the provinces of Chinchasuyu. One should think, that it was some diabolical phantom which had thus appeared to the prince, and he immediately gave all the information to his father, although the latter was backward in crediting what was told him. Be this as it may, it is certain, that three months afterwards an account was received of the insurrection ; when Yaguar-Huacac, being greatly terrified, abandoned the court, and fled with his sons and many chieftains into the woods. The son, Inca-Rapac, assembled some people, and, having formed a small but resolute army of 8000 men, went out to meet the rebels ; receiving in his march a numerous succour from Rimares and Quechuas \ and he thus attacked the enemy, and, after a battle of eight hours, entirely defeated them. He afterwards reestablished the peace of the country, and, returning home, he was received with great joy by his father ; who honoured him with the llauto, or imperial crown, and ceded to him the kingdom ; retiring himself into a private life at Muina, where he lived seven years with his wife Mama Chicya, and died 85 years of age. 
8. Inca-Rapac, who, as soon as he began to reign, acquired the name of Vtracocha-Inca, through the vision of the brother of Manco Capac. He caused to be built to him a temple at Caccha, 16 leagues distant from Cuzco to the s. He conquered, with an army of 30,000 men, the provinces of Caranca, Ullaca, Llipi, Chicha,  in eleven days' time, deposed by the grandees and princes of the blood, who could not endure his stupidity. He thus retired into private life, leaving the kingdom in the hands of his brother Titu Manco-Capac. 
10. Pachacutec, thus called in memory of his having been established in the empire the first year after the government of his father ; and his name signifies literally, He that gives a new existence to the world. This prince extended the empire with the conquest of the provinces of Sausa or Xauxa, Tarma, Pumpu or Bombon, Ancara, Chucurpu, and Huailas. He afterwards subjected Pincu, Huaras, Pisco-Pampa, Chunchucu, Huamachucu, Caxamarca, Yauyu, lea, Pisco, Chiacha, Runahuanac, Huarcu, Malla, Chillca, Pachacamac, Rimac, Chancay, Huaman, Parmunca, Huallmi, Santa, Huanape, and El Chimu. He was constantly occupied in the war in which he made these conquests, and acquired the glorious name of conqueror, and built great temples, baths, aqueducts, &c. By his wife Mama- Huarcu he had a son named Inca-Yupanqui and several others ; and it is said that his concubines amounted to 300. He died at 103 years of age. 
11. Yupanqui, who followed the example of his father ; for he subjected the Moxos at Copiaco and at Coquimbo, and stretched his route as far as the river Maule of Chile. He built the great fortress of Cuzco, and merited by his clemency the surname of Pious. He had by his wife Mama Chimpu-Ocllo, a son called Tupac- Yupanqui, who succeeded him to the throne. He died at the age of 79. 
12. Tupac- Yupanqui. The enterprizes of this prince attached to the conquests of the provinces of Huarachucu, Chachapuya, Muyupampa, Casa, Hayahuaca, Callua, Huanucu, now Guanuco, Tumi-Pampa, Alausi, Caiiaris, and Purwaes, as far as Mocha. He projected the conquest of the kingdom of Quito, but could not put it into exHuaytata, Pocra, Asancaru, Parcu, Vicuy, and ecution ; and therefore sent his son, who suc- Acos : also the Lord of Tucma, or Tucuman, ceeded in extending the empire towards the n. as far as the country of Pastu. He died, leaving as heir to the kingdom his firstborn, borne to him with five other sons by his wife Mama-Ocllo. 
13. Huayna-Capac, who prosecuted the conquests of his father, adding to the crown the countries of Chacma, Pacasmayu, Sana, Collque, Tucmi, Sayanca, Mutupi, now Amotape, Pichiu, Sullana, and Tumpiz, now called Tumbez : he also subjected the nations Chunana, Collonque, Cintuy, Yaquall, and the island of La Puna; and afterwards reduced to his obedience the provinces of Manta, Apichiqui, Pichunsi, Sava,  came to Cuzco to render him obedience. The Indians have a tradition from their ancestors, that this prince foretold the entrance of the Spaniards into that kingdom, and that they would destroy the empire of the Incas. He had by his wife Mama-Runtu a son named Inca- Urco, his firstborn, and who succeeded him ; also another son, named Titu Manco-Capac, afterwards called Pachacutec. He lived 73 years, and reigned 36. 
9. Inca-Urco, who had scarcely come to the inheritance of his father's crown, when he was,  

PERU.  Pecllansimiqui, Pompahuachi, Saramissu, Passao • showing exemplary punishment against the rebellious Carangues; and commanding many soldiers to be beheaded on the lake which is now called Yaguarcocha, or lake of blood. To this prince a son of the name of Inti-Gusi-Huallpa, or Huascar-Inca, was borne by his wife, the emSress Rava-Ocllo ; and by his third wife, Maraalanta, a daughter of Augui-Amaru-Tupac-Inca, another son, named Manco-Inca, afterwards emperor. He had also by Sciripaccha, the daughter of the king of Quito, and his concubine, Atahuallpa, whom some call Atalpa, others Atabalipa and Atalipa, but improperly : and this son he was so fond of, that he made him king of Quito, but tributary to his brother Huascar-Inca. Whilst at his palace of Tumipampa, he received intelligence of the first Spaniards who had arrived on the coast of his empire. He died at Quito, leaving this kingdom, as we have observed, to Atahuallpa, and the monarchy to his firstborn. 
14. Inti-Cusi-Huallpa, or Huascar-Inca. He entered into possession of the empire in the most lamentable times ; for Atahuallpa was aspiring to the crown, and was, at it were, openly attacking the empire. The two brothers fought a desperate battle near Cuzco, in which the armies of the emperor suffered defeat ; and he was taken prisoner by the rebel, who treated him most barbarously, shutting him up in a very confined prison, and who, lastly, fearing that the Spaniards might restore him to the throne, caused him to be put to death at the age of 51. 
15. Atahuallpa, an usurper of the empire, who put to death all those of the blood royal that fell into his hands. In his time Francisco Pizarro, with the Spaniards in his company, disembarked on the coast of Tumbez ; and this person, after having proposed many treaties, whereby the reigning emperor should give up the reins in favour of his brother, at last made direct war against him ; and, conquering him in a battle near to Caxamarca, took him prisoner, and caused him to be put to death privately in a prison, he having been first converted to the faith, and received the baptism under the name of Juan. Thus he met with the same end that he caused to his brother, and he was, when he died, 48 years old. 
16. Manco-Capac. There being no sons of Huascar-Inca, he was succeeded by his second brother of this name, whom Don Francisco Pizarro, who passed with Diego de Almagro to Cuzco, permitted to be crowned. But this Inca  spoil found that he had but the shadow of a monarchy, and, after different treaties and negociations, finding that Pizarro was bent upon the sovereignty, he resolved to shake himself off from his hospitality, and, accordingly, collecting an army of 300,000 men, he attacked Cuzco, where he found Fernando Pizarro, brother of Francisco, with 260 Spaniards ; and these, perceiving that the enemy was already master of the city, retired to a fortress ; from whence they sallied out by night, and made a terrible slaughter of the Indians ; obliging Manco-Capac to retire to the mountains of the province of Villcapampa. Nothing further is heard of the family of this prince ; but he is supposed to have died in 1553, leaving the crown to his eldest son by his wife Mama-Cusi. 
17. Sayri-Tupac, called Don Diego-Inca ; the last of the emperors of Peru. He was acknowledged as sovereign of the provinces of Villcar pampa, Tarma, Muyupampa, and Chunchos. The viceroy of Peru, Don Andres Hurtardo de Mendoza, Marquis of Canete, through the medium of the mother of that prince, her name being Beatrix, and who was a convert, succeeded in persuading him to enter into a treaty of peace. Sairi-Tupac,ofVillcapampa, issuedforthin great pomp and entered Lima, where he made a solemn renunciation into the hands of the viceroy of his imperial dignities and rights to the throne of Peru to Philip II. king of Spain, preserving, however, his royal honours and insignias, and, during his life, the absolute dominion of the province of Yucay. He afterwards passed to Cuzco, and from thence to Yucay, where, after a short time, he was baptized, and named Don Diego Sayri-Tupac-Inca ; his mother also taking the name of Leonor Cusi-Huarcay. He lived but a short time after, and died at the age of 47, leaving an only daughter, who was married to Don Martin Garcia Onez de Loyola, knight of the order of Santiago, from whom descends the family of the Marquises of Oropesa and Alca* nices. 
Chronological Series of the Viceroys and Captains-General of Peru. • 
1. Don Francisco Pizarro, marquis of Los Charcos and Atavillos, native of Truxillo in Estremadura. He passed over to America with Alonso de Ojeda ; served in the conquest of Darien with much valour, and, finding himself at Panama, entered into company with Diego de Almagro and Hernando de Luque, lord of the island of Taboga and Maestre-Escuela of the  
■i  r T3  P E R U.  church of that city, to the discovery and conquest of Peru. He left Panama in 1525, and arrived at Tumbez and Cape Blanco, of which he took possession in the name of the king of Spain, and the emperor granted him the title of adelantado mayor, and governor and captain -general of all the places he might conquer. He returned to these parts in 1529, founded the cities of Lima, S. Miguel de Piura, Truxillo, Guayaquil, and many others; but certain dissensions having arisen between him and Almagro, since the rewards had not been equally divided between them, with respect to their shares of labours and expenses, they formed two parties, which caused great disturbances and tumults ; and thus it was that 13 persons of Almagro's party put to death Pizarro at 12 o'clock in the open day, in the year 1541. 
2. The licentiate Christoval Vaca de Castro, of the royal council of Castilla. He was sent by the emperor Charles V. in the same year that his predecessor died, and to avenge the injury done to him ; and as he took out faculties empowering him to take the seat of government, in case it might be vacant, he did so ; and having commanded Diego de Almagro, the principal culprit, to appear, he not only did not obey the order, but, forming an army, went out in search of the governor, and finding him in the valley of Chupas, near Guamanga, with his army, a battle was fought, in which all the rebels were routed ; all those that were caught being made to undergo condign punishment, and among the rest his captive Almagro, who was decapitated in 1542. Thus all was rendered pacific, and the best establishment set on foot in those provinces ; and, notwithstanding the rectitude and good qualities of this governor, he did not want for calumniators ; and he was thus, when he had returned to Spain, made prisoner, though honourably acquitted and restored to his office. 
3. Blasco Nunez Vela, knight of the order of Santiago, native of Avila, captain of the guards of the emperor Charles V. He was nominated for the viceroy of Peru, and was the first who enjoyed this title. He was charged with the establishment of new laws in the Indies, relative  instituting as prosecutor for that service Gonzalo Pizarro, brother of the marquis Francisco Pizarro ; he not only did not comply with their wishes, but began to use against them the most rigorous and absolute authority. In this state of things the audience seized the viceroy, and sent him to Spain ; but he, having obtained leave from the person who carried him over, to disembark at Tumbez, united some people in arms to go in search of Gonzalo Pizarro with his army ; when, being himself pursued by the latter as tar as the valley of Aiiaquito, the battle of this name was fought, and the viceroy lost his life in 1546. 
4. The Licentiate Pedro de la Gasca, native of Valladolid, of the supreme council of Inquisition. Such was his literary and military reputation, and the prudence and intelligence that he had manifested in the pacification of the tumults of the Moors in the kingdom of Valencia, that no doubt was entertained of the fitness of his appointment to the viceroyalty of Peru ; nor did he in this capacity fail to show great skill and management from the year thathetook possession. Although he endeavoured,by all the mild measures possible, to bring round Gonzalo Pizarro to obedience, he found himself, at last, under the necessity of taking up arms against this litigious person, and pursuing him with his army in 1548. In the plains of Sacxahuana a battle was fought, in which the greater part of the rebels deserted to the king's army ; the most obstinate of them taken prisoners, and, amongst the rest, Gonzalo Pizarro and his lieutenantcolonel Francisco de Carvajal ; who were afterwards beheaded in the plaza of Cuzco. Thus was the kingdom rendered pacific. This viceroy founded the city of La Paz, and returned to Spain, where, in 1551, as a reward for his services, the emperor made him bishop of Palencia. 
5. Don Antonio de Mendoza, fourth son of the marquis of Mondejar, who had served many years as viceroy in Nueva Espana. He was ordered to pass to Peru, to put in practice that integrity and experience for which he was accredited, and entered Lima in the same year, 1557 ; but his government lasted only a short time, for he died in the following year; and, notwithto the government of those countries, and the standing that, in that short time, he caused the  good treatment of the Indians. The royal au dience entered Lima in 1544, but the inflexibility and haughtiness of the viceroy's disposition turned into gall all the sweets of its wise institutions ; and some of the provinces having represented the difficulties they laboured under, and requesting that they might be made known to the king,  visitation and description of those provinces to be made, the first description that the council ever was possessed of; he also took opportunity of founding the royal university of San Marcos, and the Guarda de Albarderos. At his decease the government fell to the charge of the audience.  

PERU.  6. Don Andres Hurtado de Mendoza, second Marquis of Canete, general of the city of Cuenca, and equerry to the king. After having served the emperor in the expedition in Germany and Flanders, he was nominated viceroy of Peru, and entered Lima in 1555 ; succeeded in completely quelling the disturbances, of which some were still remaining relative to Francisco Hernandez Giron ; established the company of lancemen of the viceroy's guard ; brought from the mountains the Inca Sayri-Tupac, who embraced the catholic faith, and renounced his rights to the empire ; and governed with great address till 1561, when he received intelligence of his successor having landed at Paita. This had such an effect upon him, and so great was his mortification, that he fell melancholy, and died even before he had resigned the government. 
7. Don Diego Lopez de Zuiiiga y Velasco, Count of Nieva. He made his entrance in the aforesaid year, 1561, and governed but a very short time, being found, in the following year, dead in his palace, with every circumstance warranting a suspicion that he came to a violent end; but the circumstance was, under the existing state of affairs, hushed up by the audience, as they dreaded the mischief which might occur from a different conduct. 
8. The Licentiate Lope Garcia de Castro, of the council of the Indies : elected president of the audience of Lima, governor, and captaingeneral of Peru. But he was immediately superseded by the Licentiate Pedro de la Gasca, who was encharged to undertake the investigation of the affair of the death of the Count Nieva, and to bring the guilty to punishment. He entered Lima in 1564, and beginning to put into execution the object of his mission, he received secret intelligence of the exact state of the case, which made it requisite for him to suspend all further proceedings, a circumstance which gave a deep stab to the honour of many noble individuals of that city. He continued to govern with a zeal and prudence which might have been expected from his learning and experience. In his time was established, in 1565, the audience of Quito, and Enrique Garces discovered the valuable quicksilver mine in Guancabelica in 1566. The president founded also the mint at Lima, and in the following year the Jesuits were introduced into that capital. Events, all of which shed a lustre upon his government, and which terminated with the arrival of his successor, 
9. Don Francisco de Toledo, son of the Count of Oropesa, nominated viceroy of Peru. He 

VOL. IV.  niade his entry in 1569, and was during the first two years of his government employed with great ardour in the regulation of all public affairs, and especially of the establishments of the mines ; where he laid down the law so explicitly and clearly as that there have never since been any question or litigations on the subject. He was resolved upon bringing down from the mountains of Villca^pampathelncaTupacAmaru, brother of Sayri Tupac ; but, seeing that bribes and promises had no avail, he dispatched a troop under Martin Garcia de Loyola, to whom the Indian chief immediately surrendered; and, being brought to Cuzco, where the viceroy then was, he was put to trial, and beheaded, an event which caused an universal sentiment of sorrow from the known great qualities of this unfortunate man. He met his death with firmness, and was first called Philip, being so baptized. In him terminated the legitimate line of the Incas. This was a stroke which tarnished all the glory this viceroy had acquired ; and it cast a shade over talents such as to place him amongst the most celebrated that ever governed. He returned, however, to Spain in 1581, where he met a just reward for his barbarity, and a few days after his arrival put to death by command of Philip II. 
10. Don Martin Henriquez, son of the Marquis of Alcafiias. He was exercising the viceroyalty of Nueva Espana when he received a commission to pass to that of Peru. Here he arrived in the aforesaid year, 1581, and gave signs of great talent, benignity, and skill, during the short time of his reign : for he died in 1583, when the authority devolved upon the royal audience. 
11. Don Fernando de Torres y Portugal, Count of Villar Don Pardo. He was elected viceroy in 1584, but did not arrive at Lima till 1586: he governed a little more than three years, leaving the government to his successor. 
12. Don Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza, fourth Marquis of Canete, who had been governor of Chile in the viceroy ship of his father. He made his entrance in 1590 ; made arrangements for the discovery of the island of Salomon through Alvaro de Mendana, and formed an armament at the charge of his brotherinlaw, Don Beltran de la Cueva, and Castro, against the pirate Richard Hawkins, who was taken prisoner, but defended from capital punishment by the said viceroy, in spite of the sentence of the audience of Lima, as he had surrendered upon conditions that his life should be spared ; and the king readily assented  j*-J  mm  PERU.  to the viceroy's discretion. He established the atcavalas in Peru, made various regulations for better government, and finished his reign in 1596, when he returned to Peru. 
13. Don Luis de Velasco, Marquis of Salinas. He was at the time viceroy of Nueva Espana, and was commissioned to pass to Peru to the same office. Here he arrived in 1596; was made fiscal and protector of the Indians in the audience of the abuses which had obtained against those miserable objects. In his time there was a new insurrection of the Araucanians in the kingdom of Chile; when they destroyed six cities, taking prisoners the inhabitants, and putting to death the governor, Don Garcia Ones de Loyola. This viceroy was ordered to return to the government of Nueva Espana, for which he embarked on the arrival of his successor, 
14. Don Gaspar de Zuniga y Acevedo, Count of Monterrey. He passed from Nueva Espana, where he was viceroy, to Peru in 1604. In his time was established the tribunal mayor of accounts, and the Southern lands were discovered by Pedro Fernandez de Quiros. He only governed two years, as he died in 1606, leaving the government in the hands of the royal audience until the arrival of his successor. 
15. Don Juan de Mendoza y Luna, third Marquis of Montcs Claros, who also passed from the viceroyalty of Nueva Espana to that of Peru. He arrived in 1607 ; established the tribunal of the consulate of commerce ; recommended to the king the freeing the Indians from personal service, and this was put into effect ; commanded the grand bridge to be built, which communicates the city with the suburb of San Lazaro, and reigned prudently for eight years, until the arrival in 1615 of 
16. Don Francisco de Borja y Aragon, Prince of Esquilache ; in whose time the strait was discovered by Jacob le Maire, and which bears his name. This strait was also reconnoitred by the brothers, the Nodales. Immediately that he had fulfilled the term of six years, he, without waiting for a successor, embarked for Spain in 1621. 
17. Don Diego Fernandez de Cordoba, first Marquis of Guadalcasar. He also left the viceroyalty of Mexico for that of Peru, entered Lima in 1622, and immediately applied himself to the defence of the kingdom ; for about this time its safety was threatened by James Hermit Clerk, a pirate, who had entered the S. Sea by Cape Horn with a strong armament, and besieged Callao, sending into it a fireship. The active precau-  tions, however, of this viceroy annulled all his efforts. The pirate died of vexation, and his admiral abandoned the enterprise, leaving the character of the viceroy's prowess highly exalted. In this reign were published the new laws concerning the collecting of the Indians ; and, having given full satisfaction, he returned to Spain, delivering up his office to his successor, 
18. Don Geronimo Fernandez de Cabrera Bobadilla y Mendoza, Count of Chinchon, of the councils of state and war. He entered Lima in 1629, and governed near 10 years. In his time, in 1630, happened that terrible earthquake, which ruined the" greater part of the city. He resigned his office to his successor, and returned to Europe. 
19. Don Pedro de Toledo y Leiba, Marquis of Mancera ; of the council of war. He made his entry into Lima in 1639, numbered the whole of the Indians of the kingdom, reformed the rates of tribute, fortified the port of Callao, furnishing it with very good artillery, for which he established there a great foundery, and instituted and arranged the posts, with other useful dispensations, which perpetuate the remembrance of his government. This he resigned to 
20. Don Garcia Sarmiento de Sotomayor, Count of Salva Tierra, who, like many others, passed from the viceroyalty of Nueva Espana, where he was reigning, to Peru. He arrived in 1648, erected the celebrated bronze fountain in the chief square, which has perpetuated his memory, facilitated the establishment and conversion of the Indians of the province of Mainas by the Jesuits, which has rendered such very great fruits to the church, and delivered the command to his successor in 1655. He was, however, detained at Lima by the war, for more than three years and an half after ; and here he died in 1659. 
21. Don Luis Henriquez de Guzman, Count of Alva de Liste, grandee of Spain, and the first of this noble title. He passed over to Peru in the aforesaid year, 1655, from Nueva Espana, where he served as viceroy. His government was just and pacific, though not marked by any remarkable event, till his resigning it into the hands of his successor, when he returned to Spain. 
22. Don Diego de Benavides y de la Cueva, eiohth Count of Santistevan, of the council of war, who had been viceroy of the kingdom of Navarra. He came to this of Peru in 1661, when there was an insurrection in the province of Chuquiavo, the principal instigators having  

PERU.  been some Mustees : but these were made to suffer condign punishment, and the insurrection was quelled by the corregidor Don Francisco Herquinigo. Also in 1665 there was another insurrection in the province of Paucarcolla, between the Vascongados and Montaneses on one side, and the Andaluces and Creolles on the other ; the event of which was a bloody battle on the plain of Laycacota. Overcome by these calamities the viceroy died in the following year, 1666, leaving the government to the royal audience till the arrival of the successor. 
23. Don Pedro Fernandez de Castro y Andrade, Count of Lemos, grandee of Spain, nominated viceroy of Peru ; where he arrived in 1667, at the time that the tumults of Puno were at their highest pitch : and not having been able to quell them by the provisions he had made, and having now many prisoners in his hands, he caused them to be brought to trial, and sent Don Joseph de Salcedo captive to Lima, where he was sentenced to death without having been further concerned in those dissentions than because he was a man of great wealth. But heaven had directed that no advantage should be derived from the mine which had belonged to him, for at his death it filled with water, so that it never since could be worked. This viceroy settled the building of the Bethlemite hospitals in the several cities of Peru, established a headquarters between Lima and Panama, in order to assist the garrison of the latter, which was pillaged and burnt in 1670 by the English pirate John Morgan, and died in 1672 ; the royal audience taking the government during the interregnum. 
24. Don Baltasar de la Cueva Henriquez y Saavedra, Count of Castellar, Marquis of Malagon, of the council of the Indies. He made his entry into Lima in 1674, and his government was of shorter duration than it should have been ; for having been charged with an illicit introduction of China manufactures, he was ordered to resign his office to the archbishop of Lima, which he did in 1678 ; but his integrity being made evident, he was restored to his honours, and readmitted to the council. 
25. Don Melchor de Linan y Cisneros, archbishop of the holy church of Los Reyes, provisional viceroy. He governed from the aforesaid year, 1681, and without any thing extraordinary happening, save that the S. Sea was again infested with pirates, who, commanded by Juan Guarlen, Edward Bohnen, and Bartolome Charps, had proceeded through the narrow pass of the Isthmus of Panama, and having  in its port taken possession of two frigates, infested the coasts of Peru : but they were driven away by the active precautions of the archbishop, and two of their captains were taken and put to death, the rest of the crews escaping to Europe by Cape Horn. Shortly after which event the successor arrived. 
26. Don Melchon de Navarra y Rocafall, Duke of Palata, Prince of Masa, and of the councils of state and war, a man of the most brilliant talent that ever visited America. He commanded the brick wall to be built which surrounds the city of Lima, and having finished it, he had the mortification of seeing the city destroyed by those terrible earthquakes which happened in 1687. He had greatlitigations with the archbishop Lilian, respecting the correction of the proceedings of the doctrinal curacies of which the Indians were continually complaining. About this time too the English pirate, Edward David, had entered the S. Sea with a squadron of 10 vessels, which were attacked and conquered near to Panama by Don Beltran de la Cueva, brotherinlaw to this viceroy, whose appointment had just now ended, and who, delivering his office to his successor, returned to Spain, and died in the city of Portobello. 
27. Don Melchor Portocarrero Laso de la Vega, Count of Monclova, commendador of Zarza in the order of Alcantara, of the council of war, and viceroy of Nueva Espana; from whence, after two years government, he was ordered to proceed to Peru, where he entered in 1689, and where for the space of 15 years and four months he was constantly and busily employed in the war of succession, arising through the death of Charles II. and the question of right of the Sr. Duke of Anjou, with the name of Philip V. to the crown of Spain, so that the allied nations were in a state of insurrection. Thus he was engaged till his death, which occurred in 1706, leaving the government in charge of the royal audience, until the arrival of a successor nominated by the king. 
28. Don Manuel Oms de Santa Pau Olim de Semanat y de Lanuza, Marquis of Castel dos Rius, grandee of Spain, ambassador at the court of France when Philip V. inherited the crown ; and formerly ambassador at the court of Lisbon ; nominated by the viceroy of Peru before that the death of the predecessor was known. He did not enter Lima till 1707, and he governed till 1710, when he died. 
29. Don Diego Ladron de Guevara, bishop of Quito, and formerly bishop of Panama. He r 2  PERU.  entered Lima, and took possession in 1710; and in 1713 he established the depot of Negroes with the English company for labour in America : but the king being informed of the frankness with which the bishop had permitted the commerce of French ships which had passed to the S. Sea, and of the little exertions which he manifested for the good of the government, gave him a permission to return to Spain, rather than allow him the disgrace of filling a lower office at Quito. The bishop, in consequence, set sail for Acapulco, and from thence to Mexico ; and in this city he died in 1718. 
30. Don Fr. Diego Morcillo Rubio de Auiion, archbishop of the holy metropolitan church of La Plata, and who had formerly been bishop of those of Nicaragua and La Paz. Agreeably to advices from the audience, he put himself on the journey, and arrived at Lima in 1716. His government lasted but 50 days, for at that period the proper successor arrived, appointed by the king. 
31. Don Carmine Nicholas Caracciolo, prince of Santo Bono, grandee of Spain, and formerly ambassador to the republic of Venice. He entered Lima in 1716, and devoted his three years of government to the wisest dispensations, and succeeded in abolishing the trade of the French in the S. Sea. At this period he was permitted by his majesty to return to. Europe, delivering the government to the archbishop of La Plata in 1720 ; and embarking for Acapulco, and by way of Mexico, he reached Spain the following year. 
32. Don Fr. Diego Morcillo Rubio de Auiion, archbishop of La Plata, who had already been provisional viceroy between Don Diego Ladron de Guevara and his predecessor. He returned to the same functions for three years, giving his utmost attention to the defence of the coasts, against the mischief constantly threatened by the pirate John Cliperton : him he succeeded in overcoming ; and, whilst engaged in the lamentable war against the Araucanos Indians, he was succeeded in 1724 by, 
33. Don Joseph de Armendariz, Marquis of Castelfuerte, comendador of Montezon and Chiclana in the order of Santiago, lieutenantcolonel of the regiment of the royal Spanish guards, lieutenantgeneral of the royal armies, who was exercising the commandancygeneral of the province of Guipuzcoa. Immediately that he received the nomination of viceroy he embarked and arrived at Lima in the aforesaid year, 1724. At his entrance he pacificated Chile. He ap-  plied himself to the abolition of illicit commerce, and to some new arrangements in behalf of theprovince of Paraguay, causing to be put to death Don Joseph de Antequera, of the order of Alcantara, jiscal, protector of the Indians of the audience of Charcas, and nominated by that tribunal to make the visitation of the settlements of the missions of the Jesuits which were held there ; those missions which caused such great disturbances in the kingdom. He hindered the Portuguese from establishing themselves at the mouth of the river Aguarico ; and, having governed with integrity and rectitude till 1736, he delivered the command to the successor and embarked for Acapulco, and arrived by Mexico and Vera Cruz at Valladolid. He then proceeded to court, where the king,, in reward of his merits, promoted him to the rank of captaingeneral of the army, and to the golden collar. 
34. Don Antonio Joseph de Mendoza Camano y Sotomayor, Marquis of Villagarcia, Count of Barrantes, Lord of the towns of Rubianes, Lamas, and Villa Nueva, mayordomo of Semana, and chamberlain to his Majesty. He entered Lima in 1736, and, notwithstanding his pacific nature, found himself engaged in the wars with the English, whose object it was to make themselves masters of the Isthmus of Panama, and to which end their admiral, Vernon, had already made himself master of Portobello, he being assisted by George Anson, who had entered the S. Sea. But this did not take effect, from an opportunity which was seized by the viceroy of sending a squadron with succour of men, arms,, money, and ammunition, to Panama. Besides all this he had to attend to the war of the Chunchos Indians, who had rose against him. He caused an equestrian statue of Philip V. to be made, and to be placed over an arch on the bridge at Lima; increased the fortifications of the garrison and port of Callao ; and, having resigned his government to the successor, embarked by Cape Homos in the ship Hector,, and died in hisvoyage. 
35. Don Joseph Manso de Velasco, first Count of Superunda, knight of the order of Santiago,, lieutenantcolonel of the royal armies, being at the time president of Chile, governor and captaingeneral ; he received orders to come to Peru, notwithstanding that the king had nominated the viceroy of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, Don Sebastian de Eslava, to this office, to undertake it, as he did in 1745, under the critical circumstances of the English war and the insurrection of the Chunchos Indians, to quell which  PES  he had sent the fieldmarshal Don Joseph de Llamas Marquis of Menahermosa, general of Callao. On the 28th of October 1746, happened that terrible earthquake which entirely devastated the city, at the same time that the sea retreating from the shore, returned back with such an immense force as to destroy Callao, during all which afflicting circumstances the viceroy exhibited that fortitude and constancy which alone could have borne him out as the faithful protector and father of that distressed kingdom. His government terminated in 1761 ; when he delivered it to his successor, 
36. Don Manuel de Amat Junient Planella, Aimeric and Santa Pau, knight of the order of San Juan, brigadier of the royal armies, president of Chile, governor and captaingeneral of the kingdom, as was his predecessor, when he received orders of passing to the succession of the viceroyalty of Peru in the year aforementioned. He shortly after received notice of the declaration of war by the English ; dedicating himself with the greatest zeal to fortify the kingdom against their intrigues. Nothing, however, was effected by them ; and he resigned the office of viceroy in 1775 to the successor, 
37. Don Manuel de Guirior, knight of the order of San Juan, lieutenantgeneral of the royal armada. He was serving as viceroy of the kingdom of Granada when he received orders to pass to Peru, to the utmost sorrow of those whom he had governed : for his rectitude, affability, and skill, had acquired him the love and veneration of all classes. But his arrival at Peru was equally hailed as a fortunate event; he had to encounter little less of tumult and difficulty than existed in the former reign ; nor was he free from calumnies during a long career of useful services ; but even these calumnies, unjust as they were, were not loaded upon him by the Americans, but by the Europeans, the enemies to reason and justice, as was verified in the general absolution of the king at the consultum of the council of the Indies. 
38. Don Agustin de Jauregui, knight of the order of Santiago, lieutenantgeneral of the royal armies. He passed to the presidency and captainshipgeneral of Chile in 1782, and exercised the viceroyship till 1785, when, embarking to return to Spain, he died on his voyage. 
39. Don Teodoro de Croix, knight of the order of Teutoniso in the German empire, lieutenantgeneral of the royal armies. He began to serve in the regiment of the royal Walloon guards, where he was lieutenant ; and was from thence  promoted to the royal body guard, and then to the company of the guard of the viceroy of Mexico, the Marquis of Croix, his uncle. He returned to Spain, where he was nominated commandantgeneral of the provinces of La Sonora, and from his extraordinary merits appointed by the king to the viceroyalty of Peru in 1785.

Petit Guaves, or Goave, a jurisdiction, town, and bay, on the n. coast of the s. peninsula of the island of St. Domingo, and near the head of the bay or bite of Leogane. The jurisdiction contains five parishes, and is the unhealthiest place in the colony, the inhabitants being constantly subject to fevers, occasioned by the badness of the waters. Its dependencies, however, are healthy, and are remarkable for the culture of coffee. Its exports from January 1, 1789, to December 31,of the same year, were 27,090 lbs. ; white sugar — 655, 187 lbs. ; brown sugar— 807,865 lbs. ; coffee— 50,053 lbs. ; cotton ; and 210 lbs. indigo. The value on duties on exportation of      the above, was 4127 dollars 97 cents. The town lies on the e. side of the bay, 7 miles w. of Grand Guave, and 36 w. by s. of Port au Prince. Lat. 18° 23' n.

==[[Philadelphia|PHILADELPHIA]]==, a county of the province and colony of Pennsylvania in N.America, bounded n. e. by the county of Bucks, s. e. by Jersey, s. w. by Chester, and n. w. by Berks. It takes the name of the capital of the whole province. It contains about 89,600 acres, and is divided into 12 townships. On the banks of Schuilkill, in this county, is an excellent quarry of marble, from which the stonecutters of Philadelphia are supplied. It contains, besides Philadelphia, its capital, upwards of 15,000 inhabitants, of whom 180 are slaves. 
Pennsylvania, the capital of the above province, is situate most delightfully, stretching along a strip of land upon the conflux of the two rivers Delaware and Schuilkill ; it is of an oblong figure, extending two miles from river to river, and forming eight short streets, which are intersected at right angles by about sixteen others of a mile and a half each ; wide, spacious and level, and leaving sufficient space for the public buildings, churches, and market places. In the centre is a large public place in the figure of a decagon. The two principal streets, called High Street and Wide Street, are 100 feet across ; the greater part of the houses, gardens, and orchards, are irrigated by small canals running from the river and supplying to the use and necessities of the town, as also to the delight and recreation of its inhabitants.   
The dock is beautiful and 100 feet large, and of such depth as to be capable of receiving to repair a vessel of 500 tons burden. The storehouses are numerous, capacious, and convenient, and the dock so large that 20 vessels have been built in it at once. The city, without including the storehouses and the suburbs, contains 3000 houses, the greater part of brick, and all well built and of large size, the same containing 18,000 souls. The primitive plan of its foundation is not complete ; but according to that which was laid down, and which has been regularly followed up, it promises to become in time one of the finest cities in America. It is inhabited by many very rich merchants, who have become domiciliated here, through the flourishing commerce that it has, for many years, carried on with the colonies of the English, French, Spanish, and Dutch, with the islands of the Azores, Canaries, with those of Madeira, and with England, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, and Holland, making immense profits. Not to mention the abundant quantity of all sorts of provisions which this province produces, and which are carried by the rivers Delaware and Schuilkill; the Dutch employ from eight to 9000 carts, each drawn by four horses, for transporting the productions of their estates to the Philadelphia market. There entered in its port, in 1749, no less than 303 vessels, and the number that left it was about 290. Here are two churches of the reformed religion, one Catholic chapel, another of Swedes ; three Quakers meetings, two of Presbyterians, one of Lutherans, another of Dutch Calvinists, another of Anabaptists, and another of Moravians. The most sumptuous building in the whole town i& the house of representatives of the colony, where the members meet frequently in the course of the year ; and on the side of this stands the great library which was built in 1732 by the celebrated Benjamin Franklin, the same being open to the public only on Sundays, but to the founders every day in the week. Any one may take out the books, paying something for the use of them, and being under an engagement to return them at a fixed time, with the which should any person not comply, he is forced to pay a fine which goes to the increasing the collection of books : many instruments for mathematics and physics have been lately added, as also a fine cabinet of natural history. Near this library is another of Greek and Latin classics, with their most accredited commentations ; also of the best productions in the modern languages, the same having been bequeathed as a legacy by the learned citizen Logan in 1752. It has a college where all the sciences are studied, the same having been established  

PHILADELPHIA.  
13!  in the year 1749, by the said illustrious founder, as was the library, the same being also an academy of sciences. In addition to what we have said this city has been rendered celebrated, from the congress that was established here, in 1774, of the three American colonies which formed a body to separate themselves from the dominion of England ; which separation was decreed in 
1776.,. 
[Philadelphia, the metropolis of Pennsylvania, was the seat of the government of the United States, until this was removed to Washington in Maryland. It is situate in the county to which it gives name, on the w. bank of the river Delaware, which is here a mile broad. It lies in lat. 39° W 54" n. and long. 75° 10' 30" w. from Greenwich, distant about 120 miles from the Atlantic Ocean, by the course of the bay and river, and about 40 or 46 in the s. c. direction. A 74 gun ship can come up to this city ; sloops go 35 miles farther to Trenton ; and boats that carry eight or nine tons can go 100 mile farther up the Delaware. It was laid out by William Penn, the first proprietary and founder of the province, in the year 1683, and settled, by a colony from England, which arrived from that and the preceding years, and was increased by a constant and regular influx of foreigners, to so great a degree, that in less than a century, and within the lifetime of the first person born within it of European parents, it was computed to contain 6000 houses, and 40,000 inhabitants, in the city and suburbs. The groundplot of the city is an oblong square, about one mile n. and s. and two e. and w. lying in the narrowest part of the isthmus betwen the Delaware and Schuilkill Rivers, about five miles in a right line above their confluence. In the beginning of this settlement, it was expected that the fronts on both rivers would be first improved for the convenience of trade and navigation, and that the buildings would extend gradually in the rear of each, until they would meet and form one town, extending from e. to w. But it was soon found that the Delaware front was alone sufficient for quays and landingplaces. 
The buildings now occupy a space not exceeding three miles in length from n. to s. and in the most extended part do not reach a mile from the Delaware. The city is intersected by a great number of streets, crossing each other at right angles. Of these there were originally nine, which extended from the Delaware to the Schuilkill ; these were crossed by 23 running n. and s. The e. and w. streets, except High Street, are named after the trees first found by the colony  on their arrival in the country, viz. Vine, Sassafras, Mulberry, Chesnut, Walnut, Spruce, Pine, and Cedar ; which last is the s. boundary of the city. The streets running n. and 5. receive their names from their numerical order, beginning at Delaware River ; Front is first, then Second, and so on to Thirteenth Street, whence the numerical order ceases from Delaware Front, and begins at Schuilkill in the same order, as First, Second, &c. to the Eighth Street, between which and Thirteenth Street, is Broad Street, so named from its being the widest in the city. The number of squares in the original plan was 184 ; but as several of the squares have lately been intersected by new streets, their number now amountsto304 ; and several of these are again intersected by lanes and alleys. Broad Street is 113 feet wide ; High Street 100 ; Mulberry, 60 ; and the other streets in the original plan 50 feet wide. Most of the city is well paved with neat footpaths of brick, furnished with common sewers and gutters ; so that the streets are, in general, kept very clean and neat. Besides the streets already mentioned, there are several others not laid down in the original plan, as Water, Dock, Cherry, Penn, Prune, &c. Water Street is only 20 feet wide, and extends from the n. liberties across the dock, to Pine Street, parallel to the course of the Delaware, and between it and Front Street. The space occupied by it was intended in the original plan to serve only as a cartway to accommodate the wharfs and stores, so that the river should be open to the view from Front Street. It is now built with lofty houses (except a very few vacancies here and there) throughout the whole front, and commodious wharfs are extended into the river, at which the largest ships that use the port can lie in safety, to receive and discharge their cargoes ; and are defended from the ice, in winter, by the piers, made of logs, extending into the river, sunk with stone, and filled with earth, so as to be equally firm with the main land. Dock Street was formerly a swamp, with a small stream running through the middle of it. It is from 90 to 100 feet wide, and winds n. a>. in a serpentine track, through several streets. It is planted on each side with a row of Lombardy poplars, and promises to be one of the pleasantest streets in the city. No less than 662 lamps of two branches e*ach, disposed at convenient distances, in all parts of the city, are lighted every night, and are estimated to consume annually nearly 9000 gallons of oil. 
The houses in the city and suburbs are generally of brick, three stories high, in a plain neat] s 2     132  

PHILADELPHIA.  
[style, without much display of ornament. The general height of the ground on which the city stands is nearly 40 feet above the Delaware ; but some of the streets are considerably lower, particularly Water Street ; several stores in which have sometimes received much damage when the river happened to be raised by a high flood and a strong s. e. wind. 
Here are now 27 places of public worship, viz. five for Friends or Quakers, six for the Presbyterians and Seceders, three for Episcopalians, three for Roman Catholics, two for German Lutherans, two for Methodists, one for German Calvinists, one for Swedish Lutherans, which is the oldest church in town, one for the Moravians, one for Baptists, one for Africans, and a Jewish synagogue. The first Presbyterian church is finished with a degree of elegance that would do honour to any city in Europe. The roof is supported in front by six pillars, finished in the Corinthian order ; but as it stands in an obscure place, on the s. side of Market Street, it is seen to disadvantage. The German Lutheran church, which was built not many years since, was unfortunately burnt in the winter of 1795. The new building is 108 feet by 48 ; and was probably, when first completed, one of the handsomest and largest churches in the United States. Mr. D. Taneberger, a member of the society of the United Brethren at Letiz, a man of extraordinary mechanical genius, completed and erected a large organ for this church, but it received much injury when the roof and inside of the buildingwere consumed, before the pipes could be disengaged. Christ Church stands on the w. side of Second Street, between High and Mulberry Streets. It is an old Gothic structure, and is ornamented with a handsome steeple, and furnished with a chime of bells. The second Presbyterian church, at the corner of Mulberry and Third Streets, is also ornamented with a handsome steeple. The Episcopalian churches are furnished each with an organ, as are the German, and two of the Roman Catholic churches. The African church is a large neat building. It is supplied with a Negro clergyman, who has been lately ordained by the bishop. They are of the Episcopalian order. 
The other public buildings are, a statehouse and offices, two city courthouses, a county courthouse, an university, the Philosophical Society's hall, a public library, an hospital, dispensary, an almshouse, a gaol, three incorporated banks, two dramatic theatres, a medical theatre, a laboratory, an amphitheatre, three brick market-  houses, and one which is to be erected in Froni 
Street house of correction  in the N. Liberties, a fish market, a a powder magazine which contains often upwards of 50,000 quarter casks of gunpowder. The statehouse stands on the s. side of Chesnut Street, between Fifth and Sixth Streets, and was erected about the year 1753 ; and considering the infancy of the colony, the architecture is much admired. The statehouse garden occupies a whole square ; it is a small neat place, ornamented with several rows of trees and gravel walks, and inclosed by a high brick wall on three sides, and the statehouse ? &c. on the other. Pottersfield, formerly a public burying ground, is now converted into a public walk, and planted with rows of Lombardy poplars on each side. When the trees are grown, and the ground levelled, it will be one of the most pleasant promenades in the vicinity. The legislature of the United States used to hold their sessions in an elegant building in the n. a>. corner of the statehouse yard. In the n. e. corner of the yard, adjoining the left wing of the statehouse, is the townhall or new courthouse ; s. of which is the Philosophicalhall. Here Miv Peal keeps his museum, by permission of the Philosophical Society. It is the largest collection of natural curiosities that is to be found in America. In it are 400 species of birds, some living animals, &c. Opposite the Philosophicalhall is the Philadelphia library : these add much to the beauty and grandeur of the square. The Philadelphia library originated, as Alcedo has observed, with Dr. Franklin, and was incorporated in 1742, since which time the collection of books has been greatly augmented. At present it contains upwards of 12,000 volumes, besides a museum and a valuable philosophical apparatus. This library is furnished with tables and seats ; and a stranger, without any introduction, may call for any book he wants, and sit down and peruse it as long as he pleases. The proprietors amount to several hundreds, and each subscriber pays 10s. annually, for defraying expenses and making new additions. To the li~ brary is annexed a rare and valuable collection of books, the bequest of James Logan, Esq. to the public. The building belonging to the library company is remarkably elegant, and has a fine appearance. In front of the building, in a nich over the door, is a handsome statue of Dr. Franklin, the donation of William Bingham, Esq. to the company. It is of white marble, was executed in Italy, and is said to have cost £500. The public gaol stands in the next square 3 #."].  

PHILADELPHIA.  [of the statehouse yard. It is a hollow square, 100 feet in front, built of stone, three stories high. All the apartments are arched with stone, as a precaution against fire ; and it is the largest, strongest, and neatest building of the kind in the United States. To the gaol is annexed a workhouse, with yards to keep the sexes apart, and criminals from the debtors. There are also apartments lately added for the solitary confinement of criminals. The whole is securely inclosed by stone walls. 
The markethouse, in High Street, i& perhaps exceeded by none in the world, in the abundance, neatness, and variety of provisions, which are exposed for sale every Wednesday and Saturday. Butchers' meat andvegetables may be had any other day, exeept Sunday. It extends from Front to Fourth Street, and is supported by 300 pillars. 
The new theatre in Chesnut Street, near the statehouse, is large and convenient. It was finished in 1793. Further w. is a spacious building, which was intended for the accommodation of the president of the United States, but is not occupied by him. Opposite to the new theatre is the amphitheatre, wherein feats of horsemanship are, at certain seasons, performed with great dexterity, for the amusement of the citizens. It is a large commodious building. 
The university stands on the w. side of Fourth Street, between High and Mulberry Streets. It was formed by the union of two literary institutions, which had previously existed a considerable time in Philadelphia, one designated by the above name ; the other by that of the college, academy, and charitable schools of Philadelphia. They now constitute a very respectable seminary. It was incorporated in 1791. The philosophical apparatus, which was before very complete, has been lately increased to the value of several hundred pounds. The funds of the university produce annually a revenue of about £2365. The aggregate number of students, in the several schools, is, on an average, about 510. And the number usually admitted to degrees in each year about 25. The Friends' academy, and Young Ladies' academy, are also respectable and useful establishments. 
The chief literary and humane societies are the American Philosophical Society ; the College of Physicians ; the Society for promoting Political Inquiries ; the Pennsylvania hospital ; the Philadelphia dispensary; the Pennsylvania society for the abolition of slavery ; the society for alle-  viating the miseries of prisons ; the Pennsylvania society for the encouragement of manufactures and useful arts ; the Philadelphia society for the information and assistance of emigrants, and two other societies of the same kind, one for the relief of German, and another for the relief of Irish emigrants : and an humane, an agricultural, marine, and various charitable societies. Here is a grand lodge of free and accepted masons, and eight subordinate lodges. The insurance company of N. America, lately established here, is in high repute, and insure houses, goods, &c. against fire, on very reasonable terms. 
Few cities in the world of the same population and riches as Philadelphia are better provided with useful institutions, both public and private. There are also a sufficient number of academies for the instruction of both sexes. Almost every religious society has one or more schools under its immediate direction, where children belonging to the society are taught to read and write, and are furnished with books and stationary articles. 
In the city and suburbs are 10 ropewalks which manufacture about 800 tons of hemp annually ; 13 breweries, which are said to consume 50,000 bushels of barley yearly ; six sugarhouses ; seven hairpowder manufactories in and about town ; two rum distilleries, and one rectifying distillery ; three cardmanufactories. — The other manufactories are, 15 for earthenware; six for chocolate ; four for mustard ; three for cutnails, and one for patentnails ; one for steel ; one for aquafortis ; one for salammoniac and glaubersalts ; one for oil colours ; 1 1 for brushes ; two for buttons ; one for Morocco leather, and one for parchment ; besides gunmakers, coppersmiths, hatters, tin plate -workers, coachmakers, cabinetmakers, and a variety of others. The public mint, at which the national money is coined, is in this city. The great number of papermills in the state enable the printers to carry on their business more extensively than is done in any other place of America. There are 31 printingoffices in this city; four of these publish each a daily gazette ; two others publish gazettes twice a week, one of these is in the French language ; besides two weekly papers, one of which is in the German language. The other offices are employed in printing books, p amphlets, &c. The catalogue of books for sale in this city, contains upwards of 300 set* of Philadelphia editions, besides a greater variety of]

The pleasure carriages within the city and liberties, according to enumeration, are as follow, viz. twowheeled carriages, 553 ; light waggons, 80 ; coaches, 137; phaetons, 22; chariots, 35 ; and coachees, 33 ; the whole amounting to 307 fourwheeled carriages. The roads are good, and becoming better ; stagecoaches perform the journey from this city to Lancaster in 1 1 hours, on the new turnpike road : the distance is 58 miles. 
This city is governed by a mayor, recorder, 15 aldermen, and 30 common councilmen ; according to its present charter, granted in the year 1789. The mayor, recorder, eight aldermen, and 16 common councilmen make a quorum to transact business ; they have full power to constitute and ordain laws and ordinances for the governing of the city ; the mayor, recorder, and aldermen are justices of the peace, and justices of oyer and terminer. They hold a court four times a year, to take cognizance of all crimes and misdemeanors committed within the city : two aldermen, appointed by the mayor and recorder, hold a court on the forenoon of Monday and Thursday of every week, to judge of all matters which are cognizable before a justice of the peace. 
The trade of Pennsylvania is principally carried on from this city, and there are few commercial ports in the world, where ships from Philadelphia may not be found in some season of the year. The number of vessels which entered this port in 1786, was 910; in 1787, 870; in 1788, 851 ; in 1793, 1414, of which 477 were ships; in 1795, 1620, viz.; ships, 158; barks and snows, 26 ; brigs, 450 ; schooners, 506 ; sloops, 480. Clearances, 1789. It is not mentioned how many of these were coasting vessels. The number of vessels built in 1795 was 31, of which 23 were ships and brigs. In the year 1792, Philadelphia shipped 420,000 barrels of flour and middlings; in 1794, 300,751. 
The value of the exports from the state in the year ending September 30, 1791, was 3,436,092 dollars, 58 cents; 1792, 3,820,662 dollars ; 1793, 6,958,836 dollars ; 1794,6,643,092 dollars; 1795, 11,518,260 dollars. The sickness in the autumn of 1793, and the embargo in the spring following, interrupted the commerce of Philadelphia for nearly five months. The late war occasioned some extraordinary articles in the exportation of this place ; coffee, &c. were carried to Philadel-  phia, and from thence to Hamburg, as neutral ports. 
The environs of the city are very pleasant, and finely cultivated. In the n. are Kensington, near the suburbs on Delaware, noted for shipbuilding; Germantown, a populous neat village, with two German churches ; and Frankfort, another pretty village, both within seven miles, besides many countryseats. In the s. is Derby, a small pleasant borough, about seven miles distant ; and, on Schuilkill, four miles from the city, the botanical garden of Messrs. Bartrams. In the w. on the same river, 18 acres of ground have been lately destined for a public botanical garden. 
According to a list published of the births and deaths in the several religious societies of Philadelphia, it appears that from August 1, 1792, to August 1, 1793, the births amounted to 2511, and the deaths to 1497. In the year 1793, Philadelphia was visited with a severe scourge, the yellow fever, which raged with uncommon violence for above three months, and in that short space swept off nearly 5000 inhabitants. The humane efforts of a committee of health, appointed by the citizens, were highly instrumental in diminishing the calamity. A few weeks after this disorder ceased to rage, the trade of the city was restored in a manner incredible to any but eyewitnesses. It is an honourable proof of the humane attention paid to the prisoners in this city that of 4060 debtors, and 4000 criminals, who were confined in Philadelphia goal between the 28th of September, 1780, and the 5th of September, 1790, only 12 died a natural death. In 1794, there were 9000 houses in this city, and 400 which were building ; and the present number of inhabitants may be estimated at about 55,000. 
Philadelphia is 728 miles s. w. of Passamaquoddy, which is the easternmost part of the seacoast of the United States, 347 s. w. of Boston, 222 s. w. of Hartford, 95 s. w. of New York, 102 n. e. of Baltimore, 278 n. e. of Richmond, 144 n. e. of Washington's city, and 925 n. e. by n. of Savannah in Georgia. The above distances are English miles, and include the windings of the roads. The direct distances in geographical miles are as follows : Philadelphia is 480 miles s. w. of Passamaquoddy, 235 s. w. of Boston, 161 s.w. of Hartford, 70 s.w. of New York, 83 n. e. of Baltimore, 190 n. e. of Richmond, 110 n. e. of Washington, and 560 n. e. of Savannah.

They gather here quantities of grapes, of which they make brandy, which is much esteemed in the neighbouring provinces. The rivers which lave this territory are the San Juan, which is very abundant, and has its origin in the province of Lipes ; the Toropalca, which enters the Chichas ; the Cinti, which irrigates and fertilizes the valley to which it gives name; the Supas and the Agchilla, which run s. and form the Paspaya, which, afterwards changing its course to <?. incorporates itself with the Pilcomayo, serving as a boundary to this province, and dividing it from that of Pomabamba. 
It has many rich settlements, since the greater part of its inhabitants, who should amount to 12,000 souls, are dispersed in different estates. The town of Playa, which was formerly the capital, was destroyed and depopulated by an irruption made by the infidel Chiriguanos Indians. As the territory is mountainous and rough, it is filled with wild beasts and noxious reptiles. The corregidor, since that time, resides in the valley of Cinti, which is delightfully pleasant, and extends for nearly 20 leagues. Paspaya experienced the same misfortune as that which we have just observed happened to Pilaya ; both of these being equally on the frontiers of those barbarians ; but a fort has been built to restrain them in future in that part. In the settlement of Pototaca are some very abundant lead mines. The corregidor had a repartimiento of 37,400 dollars, and it paid an alcatala of 299 yearly.    ==[[Pilcaya|PILCAYA]]==, a settlement of the head settlement of the district of Cozcatlan and alcaldia mayor of Taseo in Nueva Espana. It contains 92' families of Indians, and is six leagues n. w. of its capital. 
==[[Pilcomarca|PILCOMARCA]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Cuenca in the kingdom of Quito, annexed to the curacy of the settlement of Azogues. 
==[[Pilcomayu|PILCOMAYU|Pilcomayo]]==, a large and abundant river of the province of Charcas in Peru. It rises from various streams which unite in this province, and then joins itself with the river Tarapaya,which runs from the province of Porco, collecting the waters of the Potosi, the which, having been employed there for the working of the silver, carries with it a portion of quicksilver, and from thence it is asserted, that in the Pilcomayo, fish will not breed for many leagues ; but this is not the fact, as within this jurisdiction some fish, though certainly not large, are caught. It then incorporates itself with the Cachimayo, which is that which passes through Chuquisaca, flows down to the province of Pilaya and Paspaya, and through that of Tomina enters the Chaco, running 80 leagues, as far as the llanos of Manso ; from whence it follows its course amongst extremely thick forests to the s. e. and enters the Paraguay a little to the s. of Cidade da Asuncion del Paraguay. The river here swarms with fish of various kinds, and particularly dories, of from 20 to 25 pounds weight. As it is so large, and has its origin in the provinces of Peru, it was attempted in 1702 to discover a communication by it between this kingdom and the province of Paraguay, but without effect. In 1721 the Jesuits made a like attempt, and proceeded on their discovery in a bark with two boats ; but they were obliged to return, not finding sufficient depth of water, after that, from the winding of the river, they had proceeded a distance of 350 leagues : they had, indeed, chosen a bad season, namely, the months of September, October, and November, when it does not rain, and when the rivers suffer from drought. They might, therefore, perhaps have succeeded at any other time ; and could it be effected, the object^ were very great, as a roundabout journey of 500 leagues through the province of Tucuman would be avoided, and the reduction of many infidel nations to the faith would be the consequence. 
This river has a beautiful stone bridge in the high road leading to La Plata. The Ex-Jesuit, Coleti, says, that it enters the Guapay ; but he is deceived.    142

==[[Pimeria|PIMERIA]]==, an extensive province of N. America which take this name from the Pimes Indians, who inhabit it, although here are found many other nations. It is bounded n. by the province ofSonora, and extends upwards of 100 leagues. It is divided into parts, upper and lower ; and both abound with streams, which fertilize the territory, and cause it to produce great crops of wheat, and fine pastures, in which breed large herds of cattle. In the n. w. part are many settlements and farms of Indians, who, although christians, act just as though they were not ; preserving their perverse customs, and all the richest having their five or six wives apiece, and this in spite of the remonstrances of the missionaries of San Francisco. They are much given to agriculture, and besides the wheat, as aforesaid, they cultivate maize, lentils, French beans, and cotton. 
The richest land of this province is near the sea coast to the w. where there are good saline earths, and especially at the Bay of Coborca,  which is 130 leagues n.w. of San Juan, and close to the river of San Marcos ; 50 leagues higher up dwell the nation of the Papagos, an extremely docile and mild people, who live among the inaccessible parts of the mountains, and who come at different seasons to the higher part of the province, bringing with them their children to be baptized ; and they make the same journeys whenever the missionaries require them to come to labour. Here is also another nation more civilized, namely, that of the Sobaipuris. They are docile friends to the Spaniards, numerous, and live in rancherias in the most fertile valleys, building their houses of sedges woven in form of a mat. They sow maize and wheat, and breed some sheep. In the mountains and mountain plains are many mines which are not worked. The climate in this part is of a very irregular temperature, being moist, cold, and windy. The rain and snow fall continually during the winter, and they last six or eight days. 
These Sobaipuris Indians are bounded by others, called Cocomaricopas ; amongst the which are some, although few, who have embraced the faith, persuaded by some of the missionaries who have made their way amongst them ; but they, nevertheless, do not quit their barbarous habits. They are at continual warwith the Niojoras, with whom they are bounded ; the territories of the two being divided by a large river which collects many streams flowing down from the sierra Madre, by the n. and empties itself into the sea by the w. From the enmity and hatred existing between these two nations, the Cocomaricopas steal away all the children of the Niojoras that they can lay hands on, and sell them as slaves to the Pimes : these sell them to the Spaniards, who buy them at a very low price and baptize them, keeping them till they are instructed in the faith for menial purposes, but this is generally a very long period, owing to the natural stupidity of this race, and to the difficulty of instructing them in the Mexican tongue. 
These Niojoras have the credit of being very gentle, pusillanimous, and cowardly. Their numbers are small. They are bounded by the Moquinos, who dwell in the centre of the sierra Madre. On the n. part, bordering on Nuevo Mexico, there were formerly some christians converted by the zeal of apostolical missionaries of San Francisco ; but all having rebelled, and put to death the ministers of the gospel, they still remain in their idolatry and barbarism, without their reduction ever having again been able to be brought about, In this province of La Pime-    P I N  ria less progress in civilization has been made than might have been wished, owing to the repeated invasions of the Apaches Indians ; and thus it is that the greater part of it is seen to be uncultivated and unpeopled. As some check to the above grievances the garrison of San Felipe de Jesus Guevavi was founded in 1745.

==[[Piritu|PIRITU]]==, a province of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada ; bounded by that of Venezuela on the e. at the Cape of Codera and by that of Cumana, on the w. by the river and vallies of Santa Fe. Its length of coast between the two aforesaid provinces is 70 leagues ; and its climate is intolerably hot during calms, but temperate when the breezes are up. In the time of the rains the heat is more intense, from the vapours which exhale from the earth ; and these begin from the month of June and last till October. The rains in common years are almost daily, and always attended with storms of thunder and lightning. The days are equal. This province is watered by many rivers, all of which run into the sea : the Pertigalete, Guantar, Nevery, Huare, Uchire, Cupira, Paparo, Higuerote, and Curiepe. 
On its coast are some bays, and convenient ports, which abound in fish of various kinds, and in shellfish, of which the natives are very fond. Also in the mountains are a great variety of wild beasts, lions, tigers, very large and fierce ; two kinds of bears, antas, sanos ; porcupines, rabbits, squirrels, and four different sorts of monkies, one only of which, called araguata, is eaten by the Indians : these are large, of a red colour, and have long beards like goats. Here also breed numbers of deer, and plenty of noxious creatures, such as snakes of different species, rattlesnakes.  
I ~^vj   P I R I T U.  anteaters, which they here call quiaguequenoto ; centipes, scorpions ; very large spiders, black and hairy ; ticks, and musquitoes of many sorts, so troublesome, that it is impossible to sleep without a musquitonet. These latter insects sometimes appear in a cloud, obscuring the sun. Here are also reremice, which, although prejudicial, since they sometimes bite the tops of the fingers of a person asleep, have the property of eating up the musquitoes, there being some of these latter most troublesome insects, which leave in the puncture the seed for a worm which breeds within the cutis, causing incredible pain unless it be killed with tobacco. 
This province is no less plagued with noxious ants, but there is a great, rare, and excellent variety of birds, as of parrots, which learn with greater facility to speak the Indian than the Spanish lancotoras, which are very loquacious ; cardenales, of a most beautiful colour : and another bird, as small as the goldfinch, of a green colour, with the union of the wings blue, and the beak curved ; which imitates the song of the other birds, and is called by the Indians pupitiri ; another called turicha, which has the breast and wings bl ick and white, and the rest of the body orange, and which is domesticated so as to eat from the hand or the table. Here are also partridges, which, although resembling the Euro^ pean, are much larger and of a different colour and note ; quails, doves, turtledoves, geese, white and black turkies with yellow feet, and wild fowl. 
This province was peopled by Indians of the nations of the Cumanagotos, Palenques or Guatines, Cores, Tumuzas, Chaimas, Farautes, Cuacas, Arvacas, Caribes, and others. Its conquest was proposed to the king by Don Juan de Urpin, native of the principality of Cataluna ; when it fell out that the natives surrendered themselves up, seeking a peace. This person then founded the city of Barcelona, at a distance from that of the present day. A short time after lie died, and was succeeded by Captain Diego de Urbes ; but the violences offered by the Indians induced his majesty Philip to ask the opinion of Don Fernando Lobo, bishop of Puerto Rico, to whose diocess the province belonged : and this dignitary having i*eturned for answer, that these Indians were rather to be conquered by mild than coercive measures, and that the peaceful influence of the gospel would tend more to ensure their obedience than the force of arms ; the monarch caused to be sent thither some religious of the  order of San Francisco, who entered the province in 1656 from the convent of Abrojo ; and who, with their commissary Fr. Juan de Mendoza, who had been provincial in Florida, and with others who have since succeeded to the mission, have reduced to the Catholic faith those infidels, founding 40 settlements which still exist, and in which dwell 12,000 Indians, and are as follows :

It takes the name of Piritu from the country or territory inhabited by its natives, from the abundance of a species of small palm found here, the fruit of which resembles unripe grapes, and having the trunk like a cane, covered with thorns very black, and so strong and close, as to be used for pipes for smoking, it resisting very strongly the influence of fire.

The country in its environs is rich and well cultivated ; and is much resorted to from the maritime parts of the state in the sickly months. The Hickory Mountain is not far distant, and the air and water here are as pure as any in the world. It is 21 miles s. of Hilsborough, 29 W. of Raleigh, and 39 n. n. w. of Fayetteville.] 
[==[[Pittsburgh|PITTSBURGH]]==, a posttown of Pennsylvania, the capital of Alleghany County, situate on a delightful plain running to a point. The Alleghany, which is a beautiful clear stream, on the n. and the Monongahela, which is a muddy stream, on the s. uniting below where Fort du Quesne stood, form the majestic Ohio, which is there a quarter of a mile wide ; 1188 miles from its confluence with the Missisippi, and 500 above Limestone, in Kentucky, including the windings. This town was laid out on Penn's plan, in the year 1765, on the e. bank of the Monongahela, about 200 yards from Fort du Quesne, which  
P 1 T coals. Before the revolution, one of these coalhills, it is said, took fire, and continued burning eight years, when it was effectually extinguished by part of the hill giving way and filling up the crater. On the back side of the town, from Grant's Hill, (so called from his army being here cut to pieces by the Indians) there is a beautiful prospect of the two rivers, wafting along their separate streams till they meet and join at the point of the town. On every side, 'hills covered with trees, appear to add simplicity and beauty to the scene. 
At the distance of 100 miles up the Alleghany is a small creek, which, in some places, boils or bubbles forth, like the waters of Hell Gate, in New York State, from which proceedsan oily substance, deemed by the people of this country singularly beneficial, and an infallible cure for weakness in the stomach, for rheumatic pains, for sore breasts in women, bruises, &c. The oil is gathered by the country people and Indians, who boil it and bring it to Pittsburg for sale ; and there is scarcely a single inhabitant who does not possess a bottle of it, and is able to recount its many virtues, and its many cures. 
The navigation of the Ohio, in a dry season, is rather troublesome from Pittsburg to the Mm  in  was taken from the French, by the British, 1760, and who changed its name to Fort Pitt, in honour of the late Earl of Chatham . It contains between 150 and 200 houses, a gaol, courthouse, Presbyterian church, a church for German Lutherans, an academy, two breweries, and a distillery. It has been lately fortified, and a party of troops stationed in it. By an enumeration made Dec. 1795, it appears that there were then 1353 inhabitants in this borough; the number has since increased to upwards of 2000, the most opulent of whom are Irish. 
The manufactories are described by Mr. Ashe as being various and flourishing, particularly that of glass; and shipbuilding is practised to a considerable extent. In October, 1806, there were several vessels of 350 tons on the stocks. Through Pittsburg is carried on an extensive trade to the distant ports of Philadelphia and New Orleans. Here are storekeepers, who exchange the produce of the surrounding countries, within a circle which embraces a space of not less than 5650 miles. 
The hills on the Monongahela side are very high, extend down the Ohio, and abound with  go

==[[Piura|PIURA]]==, a province and corregimiento of the kingdom of Peru, in the bishopric of Truxillo : bounded n. e. by the province of Loxa, of the kingdom of Quito ; e. by that of Jaen de Bracamoros, of the same kingdom ; s. e. by the district of Huambos, of the province of Caxamarca; w. by the S. Sea, and n. w. by the Bay of Guayaquil. Its length is 66 leagues from n. to s. including the unpeopled tract of Sechura, and 14 in width. Its temperature is that of the other provinces of the coast, of no very intense heat, but moderately cool and healthy, with the exception of that part which looks to the sierra, where the heat is felt somewhat stronger, but not so much as in the Cordillera of the *. part of the kingdom, as the country is not so elevated from Conchucos towards the n. as in other parts where the cordillera runs. It abounds greatly in maize, cotton, sugar, which they make here of excellent quality ; pita, wheat, vetches, French beans, melons, quinces, and other European fruits ; but its principal commerce consists in soap and tanned leather, which are carried for sale to the other provinces of the kingdom, to Quito, and exported to Panama. Here are also plenty of goats, herds of which are found over a great part of the province of Sana, and of the fat of which they make soap. There are many wild beasts in the woods : and these are crowded with various trees, of different sorts of wood, though those which abound most are the oaks, which are verylarge, strong, and incorruptible ; the bridges of the river Lambayeque and those of other bridges being built on piles of the same timber, and which have lasted since the conquest of the kingdom : on the acorns of these trees the goats fatten. Near the settlement of Amotape, towards the coast, is a mine of naphta or bitumen, which is black and durable, and serves for careening vessels in lieu of pitch, although it be commonly used mixed with this. 
This province is watered by some rivers, which are considerable only in the months that it rains in the sierra. The principal are, the Tumbez towards the n. the Chira to the s. of the province, and that which passes by the capital. The two latter have their source in the cordillera, towards the province of Loxa, and empty themx 2  P I V    selves into the S. Sea. The latter is near the settlement of Sechura. On the shore of its district is found quantities of the fish called tollo, which is the cod of Peru and Quito. It has a tolerably good port called Paita, where vessels arrivingfrom Panama and other parts come to anchor. The inhabitants of this province amount to 11,000, divided into 26 settlements. The corregidor had a repartimiento of 50,000 dollars, and it paid an alcabala of 400 annually. 
The capital is of the same name with the dedicatory title of San Miguel: the first town founded in Peru by Don Francisco Pizarro, in 1531, and where was erected the first temple wherein worship was offered to the true God in S. America. Its first situation was in the llanura of Targosala, from whence it was, a little after, translated to the part where it now stands, in an extensive sandy llanura, the former spot being unhealthy, which is not the case with this latter; for it is, besides, of a delightful climate, with fine pure air, particularly for such as are recovering from the venereal disease, which is cured with great ease in its hospital; so that patients come hither from the other provinces for this purpose, as also to benefit by the waters of the river, which runs amongst woods of zarzaparilla. Its territory is very fertile, and produces much cotton, sugar, pita, maize, and other fruits. Its population consists of upwards of 7000 souls, and amongst them are many noble and grand families. Here are convents of the religious orders of San Francisco, La Merced, and an hospital of the Bethlemite fathers. The church of Nuestra Senora del Carmen was destined for the Jesuits of the province of Quito, who had founded a college there. It is the residence of the corregidor, and of the treasury and royal chests, and their ministers, who resides sometimes in the city, and at other times at the port of Paita. It suffered much from an earthquake in 1619 :— 480 miles n. n. w. from Lima, 208 n. n. w. of Truxillo, on which it depends in ecclesiastical concerns, and not on Quito, as Mr. Martiniere, in the word San Miguel, asserts; 25 from Paita, and seven e. from the sea. It never rains here, and it is in lat. 5° IF 2" s. and long. 80° 36" w. The settlements, of which its corregimiento are composed, are — Piura, La Punta, Morropon, Suipira, Catacaos, Sechura,

The aforesaid river flows down from the mountains of Guancabamba to the e. and collects in its course the waters of the Gualcas, Sauri, Morropon, and Frias, running to the n. w. It then turns w. towards the part called Corral Quemado, and from thence to s. w. It laves the capital, which is on its w. shore, and to which, in its floods, it has done much mischief. In the spring it is nearly dry, and runs under the ground ; where wells are made to extract its waters. It disembogues itself into the Gulf of Sechura, by the s. part, in lat. 5° 32" s.

==[[Plaisance|PLAISANCE|Placentia]]==, a settlement of the s. coast of Newfoundland, with a celebrated bay and port, much frequented bj vessels employed in the codfishery. The entrance is by a narrow channel, through which not more than one vessel can pass. It is of sufficient depth for large vessels, and is capable of containing 150 in perfect security, well sheltering them from the winds; also, the fishing in it is as tranquil as in a river. In front of the channel is a road, which is a league and an half in extent, but much exposed to the 20. winds, which are frequent here. The narrow part of the channel is caused by a chain of dangerous rocks, to avoid running foul    of which, it is requisite to bear upon the starboard in entering the bay. In one of them the French had a fort, called San Louis. The currents here are very violent. The coast, on which they fish for cod, is about a league in extent, between two rapid currents ; one of which, situate to the s. w. is divided by a river which issues from the channel, and forms a sort of lake, called the Little Bay, and in which many salmon are caught. On this coast, or strand, is carried on a fishery, for lading 60 ships ; and on another, called Little Strand, is caught the fish accustomed to lie nearest the coast. Both these fisheries are carried on without the least danger. On the shore of the aforesaid stream the French have built some cabins, and, not very distant from these, is situate the settlement which was ceded to the English, with the fishery, in the peace of Utrecht.

Plata, with the dedicatory title of S. Sebastian, another city of the province and government of Popayan in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada: founded by Sebastian Quintero, in 1551, and not in 1538, by Sebastian de Benalcazar, as the Ex-Jesuit Coleti asserts, in a beautiful and extensive llano called De Cambis, in the territory and country of the Jalcones Indians, on the shore of the river Guali, which laves it on the s. and 12 miles from the river Magdalena. It is the head of the district of a temperature so hot, that even in the winter the heat is felt here. It is fertile and abundant in fruits and silvermines, which afford its principal commerce, although it is nevertheless poor and reduced; and yet there are in its population some families of distinction : 46 miles e. from Popayan, 165 s. s. w. of Santa Fe, and 35 w. n. w. of Timana, in lat. 2° 24' n. and long. 75° 46' '». 
Plata, a large, abundant, and navigable river of S. America ; one of the largest known after the Maranon or Amazonas, and giving its name to some very extensive provinces : discovered by the pilot Juan Diaz de Solis in 1515; who navigated it as far as a small island in lat. 34° 23' 30" s. and who, having seen on the shores some Indian cabins, had the boldness to disembark with ten men ; when they were all put to death at the hands of those infidels. Five years afterwards there arrived here Sebastian Goboto, who passed from the service of the English to that of the Spaniards, by the former of whom he was sent to the discovery of the Strait of Magellan. But he, finding himself impeded in his views by an insurrection of the people, was under the necessity of entering the river La Plata: by this he navigated as far as the island discovered by Solis, and to which he gave the name of San Gabriel. Seven leagues above this island he discovered a river called San Salvador, and another at 30 leagues distance, which the natives called Sarcana ; where he built a fort, which he named the Tower of Gaboto. He then pursued his voyage as far as the conflux of the rivers Parana and Paraguay, and leaving the former to the w. entered by the second, and had a battle with the Indians, in which he lost 25 men : but succeeded in routing the infidels, taking from them many valuables of silver, which these had brought  from Peru ; and he thus, supposing that there was an abundance of this metal in the territories washed by this river, called it Rio la Plata (River of Silver) ; whereby it lost the name of Solis, first given it by the discoverer. 
This river receives in its extensive course the water of various other very large rivers, so that it is accustomed to have such excessive high floods as to inundate the country for many leagues, fertilizing it, however, in the same manner as the Nile. When this rise occurs, the Indians take their families and effects, and retire to their canoes, where they live till the waters subside, and that they can return to their habitations. The current of this river, when it runs into the sea, is so rapid and violent, that its waters, which are clear and salutary, maintain themselves sweet, without mixing with the waters of the ocean, for many leagues from its entrance. It abounds with an incredible multitude of fish, and on its shores are many most beautiful birds. The distance from the conflux of the Paraguay and Parana to its mouth, is about 200 leagues by the course of the river, the whole space being filled with the most delightful islands, and being navigable for the largest vessels. 
The country on either side of the river is most extensive and level, but so scantily supplied with fountains, lakes, or streams, as to render travelling very precarious. It produces every species of American and European fruit, as also grain and seeds, cotton, sugar, honey, &c. but what is its chief recommendation is its excessively large breeds of cattle, inasmuch as it abounds in excellent pastures, from the llanuras extending for upwards of 200 leagues. The first heads of cattle brought from Europe have increased to such a degree, that it is impossible for any one to define those which belong to himself; from whence it arises that all are in common, and every one takes such as he may want, the number "being so extraordinary, that, for lading all the vessels which come to Spain, many thousand animals are killed merely for the sake of their hides, the flesh being left to be devoured by the wild beasts and the birds of prey. Those who want milk, go out and profit by as many cows as they require, driving home with them the calves : nor is there a want of an equal abundance of horses ; the which are common to all, with no other expense or trouble than that of catching them : the birds and animals of the chase are also equally numerous, and the partridges, which are as large as the hens of Europe, are not unfrequently knocked down with sticks. In short,  

PLAT A.  there is nothing wanting in this country but salt .and fuel; the first, however, is brought in vessels, and for the second, large plantations of peachtree's are made, which, from the richness of the soil, produce extremely well. 
This river is at its mouth about 60 leagues wide ; the said mouth being formed by the Cape San Antonio on the s. part, and that of Santa Maria on the n. From thence as far as Buenos Ayres it preserves its name, being afterwards called the Parana. Although, as we have before observed, it is, the whole of it, navigable, it has many shoals and rocks, on which many vessels have been wrecked, especially during the prevalence of some very impetuous winds, which they here call pamperos ; and which blow from w. to s.w. acquiring from the shore so much the greater force in proportion to the smallness of the obstacles they find to impede their course; for they sweep over llanuras of 200 leagues without being interrupted either by mountains or trees. On some occasions, though not very frequently, a regular hurricane takes place here; the which, if it takes its course along the river, no vessel can resist, but its masts are immediately snapped in twain, as has happened to some ships even when their topmasts and yardarms were struck. In this river the storms are more frequent than at sea. It laves the cities of Buenos Ayres, the colony of Sacramento, which belonged to the Portugueze, and Monte Video. It has some very good ports, and its mouth is in lat. 35° 30'*. 
[In continuation of the description of the river La Plata, we shall first give some extracts respecting the jurisdiction of this name from the work of Mr. Mawe, and, afterwards, a concise account of the late revolutions with which that jurisdiction has been affected— Mr. Mawe thus describes the approach to this mighty river : 
" Wearied and exhausted by frequent calms under a vertical sun, we were at length relieved by a breeze ; and crossing the line at long. 23° m. had a favourable passage to the mouth of the great river Plata, our entrance into which we were enabled to judge from the muddy colour of the water and from numerous flights of sea birds, long before we saw land. 
" Our passage," he continues, " was impeded by a strong s. w. gale, in these parts called a pampero, which blew for several days, and obliged us to lay the vesselto during the whole time ; we shipped so much water, that our boats were hourly in danger of being washed away, and, owing to the stupid carelessness of a Ge-  noese sailor, our cabin was at one time halffilled. The gale at length ceased ; a breeze sprung up to the e. and we made all possible sail : after running a s. w. course for two days, we found soundings at 35 fathoms water, and on the second day following, at noon, saw the high land of Maldonado at a distance of about nine leagues, and the Isle of Lobos four or five leagues ahead. Passing through the channel which divides them, we encountered a strong breeze, and soon afterwards found ourselves in a very critical situation ; a dark night, a heavy and increasing gale of wind, the violent uncertain currents of the river, the English bank to the s. and the Isle of Flores to the w. n. w. The captain knew nothing of the navigation, and I was obliged to command instead of advising. I caused the vessel to be laidto, under the smallest and most manageable sail possible; kept the lead continually going, and wore the vessel every two hours. The night was one of the most dreadful I ever witnessed; the moon was overcast by heavy black clouds pouring torrents of rain, accompanied with terrible lightning and loud thunder ; the waves, owing to the shallowness of the water (seven and eight fathoms), appeared like breakers. At daylight our prospect was not much bettered ; a' dense fog hindered us from seeing at all beyond the vessel, and the conflict of the wind with the current rendered the waves still more boisterous. In the course of the morning the thunder moderated, but the stormy rain continued : no object was distinctly visible ; hidden rocks and sandbanks lay on each side of us ; and we were approaching a channel not a mile wide, rendered more formidable by a strong and evershifting current. In consequence of incessant exertion I was in a most exhausted state, but the captain and crew were incapable of affording me a moment's respite; danger seemed to have deprived them of their reason, and they looked on all that passed with a fearful and senseless apathy. I had often had occasion to observe the intrepid constancy and activity of British seamen in similar emergencies, and I could not but be struck with the contrast. We shipped several heavy seas which had the appearance of brokenwater, and hence it again became necessary to keep the lead continually going. At eleven A. M. on finding that we shoaled our water extremely fast, being already in four fathom and over very hard ground, I was convinced that we were at the head of the English bank, and therefore immediately wore on the other tack toward the island of Flores. The]  PLATA.   ["fog prevented us from taking a meridianal observation, but at three P. M. it cleared, and to our great joy we saw Monte Video before us at four leagues distance. Our seamen now took heart, and began to be more expert ; we made all sail ; but the wind gradually declining, and a strong current setting directly from the harbour, we were obliged in the evening to let go our anchor about two leagues outside the port." 
Mr. Mawe, owing to his short stay at Buenos Ayres, had no time to make any geological researches ; indeed the country behind it, being a vast plain, without any traces of rock, did not offer much scope for such an undertaking. With the exception of a part of the bank near the mole, which is of granite, he scarcely found an indurated substance during the whole route. Judging from the shells and other marine productions which are occasionally found in the pampas he should conclude that those extensive level districts have formed, at some period, the bottom of the river, and that they have been left dry by the progressive precipitation of matter and the deepening of the Rio de la Plata in its present channel through a long course of ages. A circumstance which seems to support this conjecture is, that the land continually gains upon the river, and that at those times when the wind blows from the Pampas, a considerable extent of the bank on the side of Buenos Ayres is left dry. 
The population of Buenos Ayres and its immediate suburbs, exclusive of the country in its vicinity, has been ascertained to amount to upwards of 60,000 souls. The proportion of females to males is said to be as four to one ; but if we take into consideration that many men are almost daily arriving from Europe, as well as from the S. American provinces, and that under the old government neither the militia nor the marine was recruited from the mass of the population, we shall find reason to conclude that the proportion of the sexes is not so unequal. In the interior the excess of males is very great, for as the lands are granted in large tracts only, and but poorly cultivated, there is no encouragement for the labouring classes to marry and settle upon them. The poor are compelled to remain single from the very bare resources on which they depend for subsistence, and are accustomed to consider the married state as fraught with heavy burdens and inevitable misfortunes. It is not uncommon to find estates larger than an English county with hardly more than 100 labourers upon them, who subsist upon the sale of a little corn, which each  is permitted to grow for himself, but only to such an extent as a single man can plough. 
The various races which compose the population are as follow : 
1. Legitimate Spaniards or Europeans. In Buenos Ayres there are about 3000 ; in the interior the number is very trifling, except in Potosi, which, being a mining country, contains many. 
2. Creoles ; legitimate descendants from Spaniards or Europeans. 
3. Mestizos ; the offspring of European and Indian parents. 
4. Indians; almost all of whom have some mixture of Spanish blood. 
5. Brown mixtures of Africans and Europeans. 
6. Mulattoes of various degrees. 
All these races intermix without restraint, so that it is difficult to define the minor gradations, or to assign limits to the evermultiplying varieties. Few families are entirely exempt from characteristics of Indian origin, physical as well as moral. It is well known that in the Spanish colonies little regard is now paid to purity of blood ; the various regulations for preserving the races distinct have gradually become obsolete. This may be regarded as a momentary evil ; but may it not be conducive in the longrun to the good of society, by concentrating the interests of the various classes, which in remaining separate might one day endanger the stability of the government, as has been the case in the French colony of St. Domingo ? 
In describing the orders of society in Buenos Ayres, it is necessary to premise that we class them, not by degrees of birth, rank, or profession, but by the relative estimation in which they stand, in point of property, of public usefulness. 
According to this scale, the first which comes under consideration is the commercial class. Every person belonging to it, from the huckster at the corner of the street, to the opulent trader in his warehouse, is dignified by the appellation of merchant, yet few individuals among them can lay just claim to that title, as they are wanting in that practical knowledge so essential in commercial dealings. They are averse to all speculation and enterprise ; the common routine of their business is to send orders to Spain for the articles they need, and to sell by retail at an exorbitant profit ; beyond this they have hardly a single idea, and it has been said that their great reason for opposing a free trade with foreign nations is a consciousness of their own mercantile inexperience. The more con-]  

PLATA.  fsiderable houses are almost all branches of some European establishment ; few of the Creoles have any regular trade. Those amongthem however, who engage in it are much more liberal in their transactions than the old Spaniards, and are observed to make less rapid fortunes, for their manly and independent character makes them spurn a miserable economy, and disdain to assume that churchgoing practice which must be observed twice or thrice a day by those who would enrich themselves through the patronage of the opulent families. Among the inferior tradesmen, those who gain most are the pulperos, the warehousemen, and the shopkeepers. The pulperos retail wine, brandy, candles, sausages, salt, bread, spices, wood, grease, brimstone, &c. Their shops are generally lounging places for the idle and dissipated of the community. In Buenos Ayres there are about 700 of them, each more or less in the interest of some richer individual. The warehousemen sell earthen and glass ware, drugs, various articles of consumption, and some foods of home manufacture, wholesale and retail, 'he shopkeepers amount to nearly 600 in number ; they sell woollen cloths, silk, cotton goods of all sorts, hats, and various other articles of wearing apparel. Many of them make considerable fortunes, those especially who trade to Lima, Peru, Chile, or Paraguay, by means of young men whom they send as agents or factors. There is another description of merchants, if such they may be called, who keep in the back ground and enrich themselves by monopolizing victuals, and by forestalling the grain brought to market from the interior, much to the injury of the agricultural interest. 
The second class of inhabitants consist of the proprietors of estates and houses. They are, in general, Creoles, for few Europeans employ their funds in building, or in the purchase of land, until they have realised a fortune to live upon, which commonly takes place when they are far advanced in life, so that their establishments pass immediately into the hands of their successors. The simple landholders derive so little revenue from their possessions, that they are generally in debt to their tradesmen ; their gains are but too commonly engrossed by the monopolists, and having no magistrate to represent them, they find themselves destitute of effectual resources against wrong and extortion. So defective and illregulated are the concerns of agriculture in this country, that the proprietor of an estate really worth 20,000 dollars can scarcely subsist upon it. 

VOL. IV.  
Under the class of landed proprietors we may reckon the cultivators, here called quinteros or chacareros, who grow wheat, maize, and other grain. These men are so depressed and impoverished that, notwithstanding the importance of their calling, and the public usefulness of their labours, they are ranked among the people of least consequence in society. 
The third class is composed of handicraftsmen, such as masons, carpenters, tailors, and shoemakers, who, although they work hard, and receive great wages, seldom realise property. The journeymen are usually people of colour; the masters for the most part Genoese, and universally foreigners, for the Spaniards despise these trades, and cannot stoop to work along with Negroes or Mulattoes. Many of the lower orders derive subsistence from these and other employments of a similar nature ; here are limeburners, woodcutters, tanners, curriers, &c. The free porters constitute a numerous body of men ; they ply about the streets to load and unload carts, and carry burdens, but they are so idle and dissolute, that no man can depend on their services for a week together; when they have a little money, they drink and gamble, and when pennyless betake themselves to pilfering. These habits have long rendered them a public nuisance, but no corrective measures have hitherto been taken, nor does there appear, on the part of the higher orders, any disposition to reform them. 
Persons employed in public offices may be comprehended under the fourth class. The best situations under government are held by native Spaniards ; those of less emolument by Creoles ; the former are regarded as mere sinecures, and the persons enjoying them are considered as in no way serviceable to the community, except by spending their large salaries within it. 
The fifth class is the militia or soldiery. Previous to the invasion of the English, the officers were not much noted for military science, or for that ardour which leads to the acquisition of it ; their chief ambition was to obtain commands in towns and villages, especially those on the Portuguese frontier, where they might enrich themselves by smuggling. The privates were illdisciplined, badly dressed, and badly paid. The effective force which the crown of Spain maintained in these possessions was one regiment of the line, which was to consist of 1200 men, but was reduced to less than half ; one regiment of dragoons amounted to 600, two of cavalry called blandengues, 600 each, and one or two companies of artillery. With the exception of the j y  
■  PLATA.  
[Blandengues, all the troops were originally sent from the Peninsula, but not having for the last 20 years been recruited from thence, their ranks were gradually filled by natives. By eminence they were called veterans, but they have been of late disbanded, and their officers have passed to the command of the new corps which were formed on the English invasion. The force of these corps may be estimated at 9000 men. 
The sixth class is the clergy, in number about 1000. The seculars are distinguished by their learning, honour, and probity ; but the friars are, in general, grosly ignorant, and render but little real service to the public in any way. (Mawe.) 
With respect to the revolution of the Spanish colonies, no part of America has made bolder advances towards the objects of its wishes, freedom and independence, than that tract of country comprehended under the title of the jurisdiction of La Plata. 
It is true that the commotions of the S. American continent have proved beyond all question, from the simultaneous effect of their operation that they have all germinated from the same seed, though the growth of the tree has been stunted or forwarded by the peculiarities of circumstance or place. It is our object here to explain the origin and to trace the progress of the revolution of La Plata. The subject has already been recently treated by various writers with much intelligence, and availing ourselves as we shall most freely of those sources of information, we fear not but that we shall be enabled to put the question, if not in a more concise, at least much clearer point of light than any in which it has hitherto been represented. 
In tracing from their origin the causes of this revolution, our attention is involuntarily, in a certain degree, drawn back to the circumstances which attended the English expedition to the shores of the river La Plata, in 1806 ; an expedition which, it has been justly observed, seemed planned with a view only to establish a military post, that might be thrown into the scale of considerations when peace was treated of in Europe; since such a handful of men, acting in direct contradiction to the only means afforded by the state of the country of insuring the lasting goodwill of its natives, could never have had in contemplation to conquer and garrison an extensive empire ; or to establish with it an enlarged commercial intercourse. 
It was attended, however, with one good, of which the British cabinet was not then aware, or its agent prepared to convert into national ad-  vantage. It gave an opportunity to those, who in the seclusion of their closets had pondered on the past wrongs of their country, who had ventured to study those rights which constitute the inheritance of all free men, to be known to each other. No longer dreading the censure and shackles of their old government, they assembled, and discussed topics leading to achange of government ; their numbers increased, and the protection of the British arms was deemed to afford a most favourable opportunity for extending the benefits of civil independence. Thus did a spark, which in its beginning was almost imperceptible, acquire magnitude ; and had it then been fostered, had civil talents, combined with a protecting and conciliating policy, been then but used, the blood subsequently shed would have been spared, disgrace would not have fallen on the British arms, and instead of that enmity which naturally followed, instead of mourning, devastation, and reproach, all would have been converted into the lasting and sincere blessings of the emancipated inhabitants, in favour of a nation that came to aid them in a cause connected with their vital interests. 
That the British chiefs were early convinced that there existed a leading party in favour of independence and a change of go vernment, evidently results from the many official reports produced in General Whitelocke's trial, but that they were also not provided with any instructions to improve that spirit, seems equally conclusive. We feel no hesitation in saying, that on the appearrance of the British army in the waters of La Plata, it was hailed as an happy omen by those who sought the melioration of their country, and the passive part of the community had sufficient reliance on the national honour to hope, that whatever was attempted would be honestly directed to their relief and benefit. We know that men high in civil authority, repeatedly pressed the English to declare whether they came as emancipators or as conquerors : and even the religious communities publicly testified their joy and their congratulations in a remarkable discourse held on the 28th June, 1806. But we also know full well on the other hand, that the English chiefs were necessarily silent, and that silence in such a case is almost worse than an unpropitious avowal. Too well we know how soon the interesting and favourable sentiments first excited vanished into air ; how rapidly the goaded pride and disappointed hopes of the people exploded in open clamour ; how rancorously the deluded sagacity of the clergy converted the]    PLATA.  fpulpits into vehicles of irritated feeling and outrageous declamation against the invaders. 
Precisely in this tone is the following extract, from the pastoral letter of the bishop of La Paz, dated the 3d of May, 1087: 
" Que seria de nosotros, que seria de nuestras propriedades, y de nuestras familias, y que seria frincipalmente de nuetra religion, si llegaran los ngleses a dominar y establecer se en Buenos Ayres, y con sus armas y su artificiosa seduccion intentasen tambien penetrar en el pais : sirian por ventura mas indulgentes con la America Espanola que lo son con la Inlanda que es casi la misma patria?" 
The effect produced by discourses of this nature, printed and circulated among a people accustomed to devour with avidity any thing in print, and to attach unbounded credit to every thing from their priests, may be better conceived than described. And sorry we are further to observe, that in the whole columns of the Estrella del Sur, a newspaper printed in Monte Video, in English and Spanish, and considered as the organ of the British chiefs, there is not a line calculated to inspire the natives with the smallest confidence, to undo in the slightest degree the unfavourable impressions, or to convey any assurances of melioration and protection to the desponding minds of a people, to whom fetters only in a new form were offered. 
With regard to the events attending this expedition, it is by no means improbable that its fate was decided by the delay which took place in the junction of the centre with the advanced division ; for, had they joined the day before, they would most probably have entered the town immediately, while part of the enemy's forces were out of it, and unprepared. This delay, though short, gave the latter time to entrench and fortify their streets, and to post themselves in the most advantageous stations. But the restoration of Monte Video was the stipulation most to be regretted ; for every principle of good policy required us to keep that town to the last extremity ; nay, some of the best informed among the Spaniards were of opinion, that our army should have been contented with the possession of the n. side of the Plata, without venturing any farther, because we should thus have commanded the trade of the interior, and Buenos Ayres would in the end have found it necessary to come to terms of accommodation highly to our advantage. 
We could willingly have spared ourselves the pain of attending to these well known and dis-  graceful circumstances, but we think it our duty to relieve the European public of one very general error ; which is, that the successes of the La Plateans were entirely owing to their chief, Liniers. Biography will have little to relate of a favourable nature respecting this man. Till he took the command of the Buenos Ayres troops he was a gambler, and to flattery and intrigue, joined to the courage and misplaced confidence of the people, whom he afterwards betrayed, he owed his advancement. That he was not even entitled to the praise of courage so generally attached to him, we can cite as a proof, that he deserted the city in the second attack by General Whitelocke,and only returned when he found that the danger was over. 
He continued to exercise the authority of viceroy after the expulsion of the English, and an instance was not long wanting to convince the people of his secret intentions to deliver up the country to the French. As soon as the usurpation of the throne of Spain had placed on it a branch of the Corsican family, emissaries were sent to the principal ports of America, to acquaint the governors of the transfer that had been made of these distant possessions, and to concert measures with them, under the previous promise of their continuance in power, how to conciliate the people to the new dynasty. The person deputed to Buenos Ayres arrived there about the 10th of August 1808, and on the 18th Liniers issued a proclamation, advising the people " to follow the example of their American ancestors, who wisely avoided the disasters which afflicted Spain during the war of the succession, by waiting till the fate of the mother country was determined, in order then to obey the legitimate authority that occupied the throne." To this were added insinuations that Spain had already yielded, and that opposition was not only untimely but criminal. 
It would not be difficult for one who has followed the inhabitants of Buenos Ayres through every stage of their patriotic efforts, who have seen them fight for their invaded rights, to form an idea of their feelings on this occasion. To behold a yoke, ten times more offensive than that which they had just resisted, now offered to be imposed upon them, was not only to insult their feelings, patriotism, and national honour, but to impeach their judgment. The fact is, that Liniers had concerted with the French emissary, that 30,000 men were necessary to keep the country in awe, and to penetrate into the interior ; a fact which was discovered from the] y 2  PLATA.  
[interception, by the British, of the dispatch to the viceroy Liniers, ordering him to make preparation for their reception." 
Liniers continued to hold the reins of government till the central Junta of Spain, on their assumption of the supreme authority, sent out Cisneros to supersede him, and to send him to Spain as a prisoner. Here again Liniers not only betrayed a weak spirit, but a want of judgment, for his powers, at least, had the merit of being constitutional ; but he ceded, without an effort, to the new comer, and retired to Cordova, where we for the present leave him. 
No sooner had Viceroy Cisneros assumed his functions than he found the treasury empty, the people desponding of the success of Spain, and a freedom of speech, hostile to her supremacy, very prevalent. With the ordinary police of oldfashioned statesmen in a crisis of affairs which bids defiance to all regular habits, and requires depth and originality of judgment, he proceeded to fortify himself, by calling around him all the ancient instruments of the despotic system of the mother country. Those who, from the nature of their talents and employments, had every thing to lose and nothing to gain by a change, flocked round him, and the customary system of espionage was organized. Dr. Canete prostituted his pen in the formation of 31 articles, which we confess that we have perused with horror : every measure, in short, was adopted which was thought calculated to rivet afresh the fetters in which personal liberty and the public opinion had so long been confined. 
The exhausted state to which the colonial treasury had been reduced by the late military exertions, now gave rise to many schemes for increasing the financial resources of the capital, and affording relief to the people. Amongst these, the most important was the free admission of British goods, advised by the leading Creoles, but opposed by all the ancient Spaniards, and by those who adhered to the old form of government. The discussion of this momentous question gave rise to a celebrated memorial by Dr. Mariano Moreno, of which, although from its merit, we could have wished to have given it verbatim, we must content ourselves with affording only a general idea. 
The memorial, composed in elevated language, breathes^ a spirit of indignation against the selfish and monopolizing spirit of the Cadiz merchants, for whose private interests the colony was so shamefully oppressed; then addressing himself to the viceroy, he energetically adds :  
" It is attempted to establish advantages on our ruin ; the government then ought to be doubly vigilant to frustrate so sinister a design. Our sovereign conferred on your excellency the high dignity of viceroy of these provinces, not to watch over and consult the dignity of the Cadiz merchants, but to preside over ours. How can a trading body, that has at all times raised the standard against the common good of other towns, that has uniformly been the advocate of monopoly, on such an occasion as this be admitted as an antagonist ? Can it be supposed that the consulado of Cadiz has any interest or legitimate intervention in the interior regulations of this province, or any vote on the means which may insure its prosperity ?" 
After successively refuting all the minor arguments brought forward by the opposition, till he arrived at that so much insisted on by their champion, viz. that " it is to be feared, from granting a free trade to the English, in a few years the ties which bind us to the Peninsula will be rent asunder." Dr. Moreno proceeds with regard to the English : 
" Our Americans will never be more secure than when trading with them; for a wise and enterprizing commercial nation detests conquests, and attends less to military enterprise than to the interests of her trade. With regard to ourselves, the days in which we live have afforded proofs of our fidelity, which might be envied even by the towns of Spain. The English themselves will ever view with respect the conquerors of the 5th of July, and the Spaniards will not forget that our military hospitals were not filled with traders, but by natives who defended the country in which they were born, by shedding their best blood in defence of their invaded rights. 
" Nothing, in the present moment, can be more advantageous to Spain, than to bind and rivet, by every possible tie, the union and alliance of England. This generous nation, struggling almost alone under the weight of the present contest in Europe, afforded to our mother country aid and succour, such as was before unexampled in the friendships of nations ; and certainly it becomes us, in our own speculations, to consult the interests of her subjects. At such a period, he cannot be considered as a true Spaniard who beholds the trade of Britain with repining ; let those fatal moments be remembered, in which our plundered and insulted monarchy found no resources within itself, for they had previously been destroyed by a subtle enemy. With what gratitude was then received the generous]  

PLATA.  [assistance, with which the English genius placed in motion that great machine which, till then, appeared useless and inert. With what jubilee was their alliance then celebrated, and with what pleasure was announced the imposing force which the friendship of that powerful nation imparted to us. It is a shameful vileness then to see, that scarcely have we thought of establishing a trade as the only means of our salvation, and one that cannot be carried on but through the means of our allies, than they are considered by our traders as interlopers, and treated with an execration no less injurious to them, than incompatible with our true interests. 
" Let us, then, prove ourselves to be good Spaniards, when we have it in our power to contribute by commercial relations to a closer union with an opulent and generous nation, whose succour is absolutely necessary to the independence of Spain. We well know, that in the war of the succession, France obtained a free commerce with our Americas, and we ought to be ashamed to deny to gratitude what dependence and dread then snatched from us. Under the necessity of consulting our own good, let us not repine that a reciprocal advantage should fall to the lot of a nation to whom we owe so much, and without whose aid that amelioration which we propose can never be attained. Such are the united wishes of 20,000 landholders Whom I represent, and the only means of establishing, with a dignity suitable to the character of your excellency, the foundation of our felicity, and the replenishment of your treasury." 
We cannot help considering this production of the Burke of S. America as a very respectable specimen of Creole eloquence ; and it was successful. The establishment of a free trade with England gradually raised the country from its depressed state ; the operations of agriculture were resumed and increased, from the certainty of a vent for its produce ; and even hides which, as Dr. Moreno says, their grandfathers threw away as objects of no value, now became a staple commodity. 
The minds of the people were at length matured ; and the supposed certainty that Spain had fallen a prey to the rapacity of a foreign power, made them anxious for their own safety. Aware of those reiterated attempts by which the French had endeavoured to enthral their allegiance, and that even the servants of the old government could not be trusted, with one voice they resolved to place the executive power in the cabildo, to "be exercised by that representa-  tive body of the people in the name of their sovereign Ferdinand VII. till a superior Junta should be assembled. Notwithstanding Cisneros had assured the people that he would adopt no measures without their concurrence, they would not permit him to retain any power, or even allow him to preside in their councils. 
On the 26th of May, 1810, the provisional Junta was installed, amidst the general acclamations of the inhabitants, and from that date, an established authority calmed every fear, and removed the uncertainty and fluctuation of opinion in the capital. 
Thus was a revolution effected, without a drop of blood shed, which levelled to the ground a vassalage of three centuries, and eternally engraved the names of its authors on the hearts of their fellow citizens. 
The first endeavours of the Junta were to inspire confidence in their constituents. It was ordained, that all the proceedings of their sessions should be printed weekly, that the people might judge of the conduct of their representatives ; who themselves considered, that mystery and reserve were only invented by power to cover or palliate crimes. Every citizen was invited to give his opinion freely, in writing, on any public measure, and authorized to address himself, personally, to the Junta in session ; or to an individual deputy, in cases of complaint, claims, or remonstrance. Measures were taken to regulate the military establishment and trade, and to reform the system of police. Thus, without a contention or civil broil, without anarchy or confusion, and without a change of civil policy, did they lay the foundation of a representative and local government ; nor were the relations of domestic life, or the security of property for a moment affected. 
Monte Video had, during the government of Liniers, been the first to convene a Junta within itself, but it was more for the purpose of escaping from the controul of Liniers, than to lay the foundation of a representative local government; and it was never carried into full effect. Its inhabitants acknowledged that of Buenos Ayres, in a general assembly held on the fifth of June,, after the communications from the latter were made known, and a public act of allegiance was: registered ; the cabildo. however opposed the measure the next day, and from that time, to the present, Monte Video has continued firm to the Cadiz regency, under the influence of Spanish naval officers, and has remained the seat of the naval equipment for blockading the capital.^    166  

PLATA.  fits population, added to that of the surrounding country, is estimated at 14,090 inhabitants, and from great desertion, the garrison of the town is reduced to 1500 men. The transactions of the interior have till very lately prevented the patriotic army of the Junta from making any attempt to dislodge this handful of opponents ; but the wishes of the people have universally tended to an union with the capital. 
Though the installation of the Junta of Buenos Ayres and every measure that immediately followed, produced the sincere and unanimous acclamations of the people at large, yet the abridgment of power must naturally be expected to have created a dislike on the part of those who have hitherto been the immediate servants of the old government, and accustomed to give an account of their transactions to the councils of the Indies alone. The royal audience, consisting of Europeans, nominated at home, had been left in the superintendance and administration of public justice, but was soon discovered caballing with Cisneros, in opposition to the Junta, whom they refused to acknowledge, or to take the usual oaths of office. To such a length was this spirit of party hostility carried, that the Junta, to secure the public tranquillity, were under the necessity of sending back to Spain Cisneros, three oidores, and the /scales of the royal audience, in order that they might be there judged by the supreme government. On the 29th of June the Junta published its manifesto, explaining the particulars which had given rise to this measure, and detailing their reiterated endeavours to bring the members of the royal audience to a sense of their duty, and as public functionaries to impress upon them the danger of disregarding the wishes of the people, and sowing the seeds of discord and disunion. 
But it is now time to return to Liniers, whom we left in Cordova ; and to illustrate a subject which, as well from distance as design, has been greatly misrepresented to the English public. ' No sooner had tranquillity been restored to the capital, by the departure of Cisneros, and his fellowplotters, than it was discovered that a more formidable party was collecting in the interior, and particularly at Cordova, headed by Liniers, the intendant Concha ; his assessor Rodrigues, Bishop Orellana, Colonel Allende, and accomptant Joaquim Moreno. Their intention was not only to suppress the votes of the people, but to oppose by an armed force all obedience to the government established in the capital. They publicly declared the Junta * insurgent, and re-  volutionary," and even the bishop endeavoured, but in vain, to profane the pulpits, by rousing a party to his cause ; yet so firm was the public mind, though at the distance of much more than 100 leagues, that very few partizans were made. In vain did the Junta of Buenos Ayres use every friendly remonstrance and exhortation to dissuade these leaders from their hostile designs, and not to deluge the country in the blood of their fellow citizens ; every overture was treated with disdain, nay, even rejected with outrage. All correspondence with the capital was interdicted, every thing on the roads was intercepted, and a plan of raising an armed force to depose the Junta, and reinstate the old servants of the government, was resolved on. Every proclamation breathed captivity, fire and sword, and every tool and despot of the old system was invited to join them. Liniers took the command of the few troops he could collect, and in vain did the people of Cordova sigh for a release from the oppression of this French satellite. 
The account of these proceedings diffused through the patriots of La Plata a general feeling of compassion for the distresses of the people of Cordova, and many volunteers stepped forward, offering to march to their relief. Towards the beginning of August the patriot army reached the frontiers of Cordova, where they were received by their fellow provincials as their solicited and sighed for liberators, who came as brothers to release them from the miseries of rapine and civil discord, and to wrest from unworthy hands the power that oppressed them. 
Notwithstanding Liniers had previously concerted the defence of the town, after dilapidating the public treasury, and committing in the true French style other acts of coercion on its defenceless inhabitants, he fled on the first of August at the approach of the Buenos Ayres army towards Peru, carrying with him his fellow conspirators, nine cannon, and 400 men. Havoc and destruction attended his footsteps ; the country was laid waste, the farms and dwellings of the peaceable inhabitants who would not join him were burned to the ground ; on them he satiated his fury and his avarice, for they were the objects no less of his cruelty than of his pillage. But his career was soon stopped. On the fifth he was taken prisoner by a small party detached in pursuit, after having been abandoned by those whom he had in a great measure forced into his service, and with three other leaders was sent to the capital a prisoner for trial. Cordova, relieved from the presence of its tyrant, unanimously]  mm  

PLATA.  [voted Dr. Furies as its deputy to the Junta, and peace and tranquillity were restored to its inhabitants. 
The incorporation of Chile with Buenos Ayres took place in September 1810, and the addition of this extensive and important kingdom, with the union of Cordova, completed a jurisdiction that reached to the shores of the S. Seas. The interesting province of Cochabamba bordering upon Peru, brought its little army into the field, secured part of the Cordova conspirators who had escaped, and relieved the neighbouring towns from their old oppressors, and from the influence held over them by the viceroy of Lima. Potosi, Charcas, La Paz, Cochabamba, Cordova, and Salta, have all joined; so that, with the exception of part of Paraguay still under the ascendancy of the court of the Brazils, the jurisdiction of the Junta of Buenos Ayres extended itself over the whole of the viceroyalty of La Plata as it lately stood, with the kingdom of Chile, and 2,500,000 inhabitants exulted in their newborn freedom. 
From the period of the first differences between the New Junta of Buenos Ayres and the Governor of Monte Video, the general aggregate of the events we have to record, up to the end of the year 1811, may be stated in these words; namely, that while the troops of Buenos Ayres were bombarding the town of Monte Video, the seamen of the latter place were assailing, in the like melancholy manner, the former city. These two powers were evidently the representatives of very different interests ; but the spirit of war seemed to be so determined in these unhappy regions, that, even when there was a temporary cessation of hostilities between those natural rivals, the old and new Spaniards of the city of Buenos Ayres itself engaged in the most deadly enmities, and were constantly conspiring against each other's lives. From about the 2d of July to the beginning of August, 1812, the city of Buenos Ayres was in a state of the utmost commotion. The cause of this is said to have been the dissatisfaction which the European Spaniards had conceived, on account of the abject condition in which they were held by the Junta of Buenos Ayres. Hence they are said to have conceived the idea of overturning the existing government, with the view of taking into their own hands the supreme authority. They failed in their project, and upwards of 200 of the conspirators (comprising the first class of merchants) were made prisoners, of whom 25 were shot. The  following extract of a letter contains some of the particulars of these unhappy occurrences. 
" The conspiracy was planned by Martin Alzagu, a Spaniard, 60 years of age, who had accumulated a large fortune in Buenos Ayres. His chief assistants were Telechea Francisco Valdepares, and a monk named Jose de las Animas. They had provided 1500 stand of arms. According to their project, the depots of ammunition and artillery, and the military guards in different parts of the city, were to be surprised at one and the same moment. They were then to attack the fortress. It was planned that a party should secure the Fort Major, and compel him to open the principal gate, at which 300 of the conspirators were to be ready to enter. They had prepared false keys to open the sally port, and 400 were to enter on that side. The attempt was to be made at two o'clock in the morning of the 4th of July. The Spanish sailors in the road were to land at daybreak, by a signal agreed upon, to assist the conspirators. All the members of the government and the magistrates were to be immediately shot; and all the native inhabitants, and the American settlers, were to be shipped off for Monte Video. The plot was discovered on the 2d, by a slave belonging to one of the principal conspirators; and, on the 3d, Alzaga and three more of the conspirators were secured, and instantly shot. Alzaga has left a wife and 14 children." 
The following is a list of the names of the alleged culprits, and the time of their death. Most of them were persons of distinction and opulence. These persons were executed on the several days stated:— 
July 3. Francisco Cara, Mathewes Camira, Sebastian Torres. 
July 6. Martin de Alzaga, Francisco Telechea, Francisco Valdepares, Miguel Marco, Jose Dias, Diego Saintenac. 
July 13. Jose deAnimos (Barbon Friar). 
July 16. Domingo Liargo, Valentin Sopina, Carlos Castelana. 
July 23. Carlos Durac, Fernandez Pares, Roque Laureta, Jose Carracela, Antonio Verduga, Juan Mourin, Mateo Fernandez Barula, Felipe Alonzo Conde. 
Besides these, one European Spaniard more, had been convicted of being a principal in the conspiracy, and had paid the forfeit of his life. In all 28 had been put to death. During these events, through the interference of Lord Strangford, a perfect good understanding was main-J   PLATA.  
[tained between the Portuguese government and the Junta; but, on the other hand, information had reached Buenos Ayres that all the Peruvian mines, and the mint at Potosti, were in the power of the army of Lima. The punishment of the conspirators had revived the animosity of the government and inhabitants of Monte Video, against the Junta of Buenos Ayres ; and active preparations were making for the recommencement of hostilities. 
Whilst such continued to be the state of affairs in the colonies, the Cortes were at length proceeding at home to adopt some measures, with a view to conciliation. The following are extracts from the Cadiz papers, of Oct. 22. 
" Cortes, 21st day. 
" In consequence of an official dispatch from the secretary of marine having been iead, and various other documents, stating that general Monteverde had pacified all the province of Caracas, and taken the rebel Miranda, and all the other insurgent chiefs prisoners. Senor Calatrava proposed, that the regency should be instructed to inform Don Domingo Monteverde, that the Cortes had seen with great satisfaction the happy results of his operations, as likewise the important services which he, and the troops under his command, had performed in the pacification and reconquest of the Caracas. This proposition was approved, with the suppression of the word ' reconquest,' on the proposal of Senor Mendiola. 
" The Cortes then proceeded to the consideration of the ultramarine commission (see the sitting of the 12th August 1812) relative to the abolition of the Mitas, (1) and the other propositions of Senor Castello. This senor made a long and learned discourse, in which, with the most solid reasons he proved the inhumanity, injustice, and barbarity of such an establishment. Having concluded, he begged of Senor Conde de Toreno that they should immediately proceed to vote, as the point did not require greater illustration, and all the deputies being convinced (except, perhaps, Senor Astolza, who had made a proposition in favour of the Las Mitas) of the necessity of abolishing an establishment which opposed the principles of equality established between the ultramarine Spaniards and those of the peninsula. After some discussion, in which senors Astolaza and Larrazabel took a part, the report of the commission was put to the vote and unanimously approved.  
" 1st. That Las Mitas should be for ever abolished." (The Mitas are a certain contribution of men which the people are obliged to give for the cultivation of the land, working of the mines, &c.) 
" 2d. That the Indians should be exempted from the personal service they gave the clergy, or any other public functionary whatever ; obliging them, however, to satisfy the parochial rights the same as the other classes. 
" 3d. That the public charges, such as the building churches, making roads, &c. should be equally borne by all the inhabitants indiscriminately. 
" 4th. That divisions of land should be made to the Indians, leaving to the provincial deputies the care of assigning the quotas, &c. &c. 
" 5th. That in all the territories of America some of the dignitaries should necessarily remain with the Indians." 
By advices from Buenos Ayres, up to the 15th of the same month, in which the above decree was passed, it appeared that an extraordinary courier had arrived in that town from Chile, with the intelligence that the European and American Spaniards had come to an amicable understanding, and that great rejoicings were going on; but we do not consider this reconciliation as likely to be of any long standing. It was also observed, that the British navigation would probably be much molested by the Lima cruizers on the coast of Chile. 
By the same post, it was asserted that the town of Buenos Ayres had been in a ferment ever since the commencement of the month, in consequence of the struggles of the different parties for power, which had ended in the overthrow of the persons in office, and that a new set was brought forward for the three ensuing months, until the next general assembly met. This is the fourth attempt at an elective body for a popular representation, and the next will probably share the fate of their predecessors, of being interrupted in their debates, and turned out of doors by the military. The new executive body consists of Dr. Juan Jose de Pasos, Dr. Nicolas de la Pana, and Dr. Antonio Alvarez de Jonte. The public appeared to be reconciled to the change. 
It is, we should suspect, needless for us to observe, after the various changes of fortune exhibited in the jurisdiction of La Plata, within the last three years, that no idea of the final issue of the revolution can be formed from the events last]  PLA  ["enumerated, any farther than as they tend to shew, and, as we believe, most justly, that the soil should perish ere the tree of freedom that has been planted in it should be rooted up ; or, in other words, that those who have pledged themselves to the cause of emancipation, would leave no stratagem, no hardiness untried, to effect the object of their wishes.

These furnaces, supplied from the neighbouring mines, produce annually from 1500 to 1800 tons of iron ware. The forges, on an average, manufacture more than 1000 tons annually, and the slitting and rolling mills, at least 1500 tons. The various manufactures of these mills, have given rise to many other branches in iron and steel, viz. cut and hammered nails, spades and shovels, cardteeth, saws, scythes, metal buttons, cannon balls, bells, fire arms, &c.

PLYMOUTH.    [about seven miles s. from the town, beyond the high lands of Monument. 
The soil near the coast is generally good ; the residue of the township is barren, and notwithstanding the antiquity of the settlement, is yet a forest. The wood is principally pine, though there are many tracts covered with oak. 
The harbour is capacious, but shallow, and is formed by a long and narrow neck of land, called Salthouse Beach, extending s. from Marshfield, and terminating at the Gurnet Head, and by a smaller beach within, running in an opposite direction, and connected with the main land near Eel River, about three miles from the town. There is a lighthouse on the Gwnet, and on Salthouse Beach is placed one of the huts erected and maintained by the Humane Society of Massachusetts, for the reception and relief of shipwrecked mariners. There is a beach in the inner beach, which exposes the shipping, even at the wharfs, during an e. storm. 
The principal business of the town is the codfishery, in which are employed 2000 tons of shipping, and about 300 men annually. There are a few coasting vessels belonging to the place, and two brigs; and 10 or 12 schooners, employed in foreign trade. Many of the fishing vessels make voyages to the s v states in the winter season. The exports, which, at the commencement of the present federal government, were very inconsiderable, not exceeding 8000 or 9000 dollars annually, are now respectable. In 1795, they exceeded 70,000 dollars, and in 1796, they amounted to near 130,000 dollars. Formerly the produce of the fishery was sold at Boston or Salem ; it is now almost wholly exported from the town, and considerable quantities of fish have lately been purchased at Boston, and exported from Plymouth. The proceeds of the foreign voyages, are generally conveyed to. Boston for a market. 
The losses and sufferings of the inhabitants of Plymouth, during the war for independence, were extreme. Their vessels were almost all captured or lost. The men who used to be employed in them, were dispersed in the sea and land service, in which many of them lost their lives : a great number of widows and orphans were left destitute ; business languished, houses, stores, and wharfs went to decay, and a general appearance of poverty and oppression prevailed. A few years of peace and good government have reversed this melancholly state of things. A young, industrious, and enterprising race of seamen has succeeded to those who are gone : business has  revived ; the navigation and commerce of theplace are more respectable than at any former period ; the houses are in good repair, many new ones are erected, and a spirit of enterprise and improvement is apparent. An academy is contemplated : a valuable slittingmill, and other works are erected on the Town Brook. A stage, which goes twice a week to Boston, is well supported ; and an aqueduct for bringing fresh water to the houses of the inhabitants is more than half completed. 
The township abounds with ponds and streams. More than 100 ponds appear on the map lately taken by a committee of the town, and transmitted to the secretary's office. Billington Sea is about two miles from the town, and covers near 300 acres. From the stream flowing from this pond the aqueduct will be supplied. South Pond is much larger. Further s. is Halfway Pond, and Long Pond. Near Sandwich Line is the Great Herring Pond. To Billington Sea, Halfway Pond, and the Great Herring Pond, alewives resort in their season in great abundance. The Great Herring Pond has been contemplated as a reservoir for the projected canal across the isthmus, between Buzzard and Barnstable Bays. Many of the ponds abound with white and red perch, pike, and other fresh water fish ; and in the numerous brooks which run into the sea in different parts of the township, are found excellent trout. These ponds and streams are often the scenes of amusement for parties of both sexes in the summer season. 
At the village of Monument Ponds and Eel River, and in some other parts of the township, many of the inhabitants are farmers. In the town the gardens are numerous and well cultivated, and when aided by the aqueduct will be productive equal to the wants of the inhabitants. .,
The situation of the town is pleasant and healthful. The e. winds of the spring, however, are distressing to persons of tender habits, and are uncomfortable even to the robust. The market is not regularly supplied. Fuel, fish, poultry, and wild fowl are plentiful and cheaper, perhaps, than in any other seaport of the size. The people are sober, friendly, and industrious. It is the first settlement in New England, and ispeopled, principally, by the descendants of the ancient stock. But few foreigners are among them The rock on which their forefathers first landed, was conveyed, in 1774, from the shore to a, square in the centre of the town.

The is passing to Cape Cod, he will pause a moment at Clampudding' Pond, about seven miles from the town, where the people in ancient days, when travelling from the cape to attend the courts of Plymouth, used to sit and regale themselves with the clams and pudding which they brought with them. A few miles further s. r on the same road, are the Sacrifice Rocks, which are covered with the dry limbs of trees and pineknots, heaped upon them by the Indians as they pass by, in observance of an ancient usage, the origin of which is uncertain. 
The cheapness of living, the plenty of fuel, and the convenient millseats which are to be found in Plymouth, will probably render it, at some future period, a considerable manufacturing town. Domestic manufactures are now very general there. Fishery and foreign commerce at present engage almost all the active capital of the town ; but the contigencies to which they are exposed may lead to some other sources of employment and profit. 
In the three last quarters of 1796, the exports were as follow : 
Second quarter - - 56,243 dollars Third ditto - - 36,634 Fourth ditto - - 36,006 In the first quarter of the year 1797, they amounted only to 11,466 dollars. This diminution has been produced by the apprehensions excited by the depredations of the French on the commerce of the United States. [ We shall conclude this article with an interesting and authentic summary of the affairs of the colony of New Plymouth, from the first settlement until the incorporation with Massachusetts Bay, 8?c. in one province. 
The first settlers of New Plymouth went, in the beginning of the seventeenth century, from England to Holland. Their removal to Holland was attended with no small ditficulty and hazard. One of the company, by name Bradford, gives this account of it : " There was a large company of them proposed to get passage at Boston in Lincolnshire, and, for that end, had hired a ship wholly to themselves, and made agreement with the master to be ready at a certain day, and take them and their goods in at a convenient place, where accordingly they would all attend in readiness. So after long waiting and large expense, though he kept not day with them, yet he came at length and took them in, in the night. But when he had them and their goods aboard he betrayed them, having beforehand complotted with the searchers and other officers so to do,  who took them and put them into open boats ? and then rifled and ransacked them, searching them to their shirts for money, yea even the women, further than became modesty ; and then carried them back into the town, and made them a spectacle and wonder to the multitude, which came flocking on all sides to behold them. Being thus, first by the catchpoles, rifled and stripped of their money, books, and much other goods, they were presented to the magistrates, and messengers sent to inform the lords of the council of them, and so they were committed to ward. Indeed the magistrates used them courteously, and showed them what favour they could ; but could not deliver them till order came from the council table, but the issue was that, after a month's imprisonment, the greatest part were dismissed, and sent to the places from whence they came ; but seven of the principal men were still kept in prison, and bound over to the assizes. The next spring after there was another attempt made, by some of these and others, to get over at another place ; and so it fell out, that they light of a Dutchman at Hull, having a ship of his own belonging to Zealand. They made agreement with him, and acquainted him with their condition, hoping to find more faithfulness in him than in the former of their own nation. He bade them not fear, for he would do well enough. He was by appointment to take them in between Grimstone and Hull, where was a large common a good way distant from any town. Now against the prefixed time, the women and children, with the goods, were sent to the place in a small bark, which they had hired for that end, and the men were to meet them by land ; but it so fell out that they were there a day before the ship came, and the sea being rough, and the women very sick, prevailed with the seamen to put into a creek hard by, where they lay on ground at low water. The next morning the ship came, but they were fast and could not stir till about noon. In the mean time, the shipmaster, perceiving how the matter was, sent his boat to get the men aboard whom he saw ready, walking about the shore ; but after the first boatful was got aboard, and she was ready to go for more, the master espied a great company, both horse and foot, with bills and guns, and other weapons ; for the country was raised to take them. The Dutchman, seeing that, swore his country oath, ' sacraments^ and,, having the wind fair, weighed anchor, hoisted' sails and away. After enduring a fearful storm at sea, for 14 days or more, seven whereof. they "|

■   [never saw sun, moon, nor stars, and being driven near the coast of Norway, they arrived at their desired haven, where the people came flocking, admiring their deliverance, the storm having been so long and sore, in which much hurt had been done, as the master's friends related to him in their congratulations. The rest of the men that were in greatest danger, made a shift to escape away before the troop could surprize them, those only staying that best might be assisting unto the women. But pitiful it was to see the heavy case of these poor women in distress ; what weeping and crying on every side, some for their husbands that were carried away in the ship, others not knowing what should become of them and their little ones, crying for fear and quaking with cold. Being apprehended, they were hurried from one place to another, till, in the end, they knew not what to do with them; for, to imprison so many women with their innocent children, for no other cause, many of them, but that they would go with their husbands, seemed to be unreasonable, and all would Cry out of them ; and to send them home again was as difficult, for they alleged, as the truth was, they had no homes to go to, for they had either sold or otherwise disposed of their houses and livings. To be short, after they had been thus turmoiled a good while, and conveyed from one constable to another, they were glad to be rid of them in the end upon any terms, though, in the mean time, they, poor souls, endured misery enough." 
After eleven or twelve years residence in Holland, in which time they had contention among themselves, and divided and became two churches or congregations, one of the congregations, whose minister was Mr. John Robinson, determined to remove to America. There were many obstacles in their way, and it took up several years of their pilgrimage to make the necessary preparations for such an undertaking. At length, in the year 1620, about one half the congregation embarked, first from Holland to England, where two ships were ready to receive them ; and they actually sailed at a very seasonable time, but meeting with contrary winds and one of the ships proving leaky, they put back and were obliged to leave her with part of their company behind, the other ship proceeding upon her voyage late in the year, so that it was about the 8th or 9th of November before they made the coast of America, and falling more to the northward than they intended, they made another attempt to sail further s.; but meeting with contrary wind and  hazardous shoals, they were glad to put into thft harbour of Cape Cod, determined to winter in the most convenient place they could find. This disappointment was grievous to them, but before spring, they considered it as a favourable providence. They were so reduced in the winter by sickness and death, that they supposed they must have fallen a sacrifice to the Indians upon Hudson's River, where they proposed to begin a colony. The master, or pilot, it is said, bribed by the Dutch West-India company, had engaged, at all events, not to land them at Hudson's River, but they were determined upon it, and earlier in the year he would have found it very difficult to have diverted them. 
The ship lay five weeks in Cape Cod harbour. They could not expect to find a better harbour, but the land was of no value. The passengers were employed, sometimes travelling by land, sometimes by water, in search of some other harbour, where there was better land, but could find none capable of receiving vessels of any burden. At length, December 6th, they resolved upon one attempt more, and after coasting many leagues, a violent storm arose and their pilot made for the first harbour, which he supposed to be Sagaquabe, where he was well acquainted, but soon found himself in a cove, since called the Gurnet's Nose, full of breakers, and crying out, ' my eyes never saw this place before,' would have run the shallop ashore before the wind, if a stout seamen who was at the helm had not called to the oars men, ' About with her, if you are men ;' and by thi9 means he saved their lives, for he discovered an opening or sound ahead, and, in a short time, run the boat under the lee of an island, now well known by the name of Clark's Island. Here they road out the storm and in the morning went ashore, kindled a fire and rested, it being the first day of the week. The next day they sounded many parts of the harbour, and found good water for ships, and were pleased with the land, and udged it the best place they had seen, and the ndian cornfields round the harbour encouraged them that they should be able also to raise bread for their support. Upon their return to the ship with this good news they weighed anchor, and the whole company arrived the 16th of December. The whole number, exclusive of the mariners, amounted to 101, about one fourth part heads of families, the rest wives, children and servants. They supposed some at least of the company which they left behind in England, and most of the congregation in Leyden, with Mr. Robinson the minister, would follow ; and this seems to havej  PLYMOUTH.  {"been the whole number expected upon their plan, for completing the colony. In truth, as many as 35 did arrive the 9th of November the next year, but their minister never came. He encouraged them from year to year, and seems to have been prevented by disappointments from those in England, who undertook to provide for the passage of him and his congregation, until the year 1625, when he died, and his congregation dispersed, although some found their way to their brethren before and some after his death. He was at first a thorough separatist, and Mr. Hubbard says " was transported with their principles so far as to publish his opinions against hearing any of the preachers of the church of England were they never so learned and pious, but afterwards acknowledged his error in a judicious and godly discourse," &c. He is said to have been a man of good learning and of a benevolent disposition, and Mr. Bradford relates an anecdote which shows him, as well as their congregation in general, to have been in no small esteem among the Dutch. 
Our new comers had obtained a grant of part Of the continent near Hudson's River, before the year 1620, and expected to be under the government of the colony in Virginia, but, before they embarked, they heard that the lands within their grant were made part of a new patent to the council of Plymouth in Devon ; so that they were going into a part of the world where there was no government subsisting by authority from any European state, nor did they carry other powers or authority with them, than what each of them brought into the world. 
They were convinced, upon their passage, that they could not long subsist without government. Some of the inferior class among them muttered, that when they should get ashore, one man would be as good as another, and they would do what seemed good in their own eyes. This led the graver sort to consider how to prevent it, and, for this purpose, they prepared the following instrument for every man to sign before he landed. 
" In the name of God, Amen. We whose names are underwritten, the loyal subjects of our dread sovereign lord King James, by the grace of God of Great Britain, France and Ireland, king, defender of the faith, &c. Having undertaken, for the glory of God and advancement of the christian faith, and honour of our king and country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia, do by these presents, solemnly and mutually, in the  presence of God and one of another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil body politic, for our better ordering and preservation, and furtherence of the ends aforesaid, and by virtue hereof to enact, constitute and frame such just and equal laws and ordinances, acts, constitutions and offices, from time to time, as shall be thought most meet and convenient for the general good of the colony, unto which we promise all due subjection and obedience. In witness whereof we have hereunto subscribed our names, at Cape Cod, the 1 1th of November, in the year of the reign of our sovereign lord King James, of England, France and Ireland the 18th, and of Scotland the 54th, Anno Dom. 1620.

Edw. Fuller, These we suppose to have been all the males, of age, in the company; 21 of whom died before the end of March, of the scurvy and other sickness, caused by bad lodging and bad diet, and the hardships of the winter. About the same proportion of the women and children died also, 50 being the whole number then surviving. In 1650 there were 30 remaining alive, in 1679 only 12, in 1694 only two; and Mary Cushman only, daughter of Isaac Allerton, was alive in 1698. We will now give a brief account of several of these persons. 
John Carver had been deacon of their church in Holland, was esteemed for his discreet discharge of that office, and being a grave judicious man, their eyes were upon him for their chief ruler, before they embarked. He lived but a short time. His grandson died at Marshfield, at J    ■ mmt  PLYMOUTH.  
*■  
[the age of 102. Not long before his death, this grandson with his son, his grandson and great grandson, were all at work together, without doors, and the great great grandson was in the house at the same time. 
William Bradford was one of the younger men of the company. Douglass says, he was a man of no family and no learning. His manuscripts shew that he was a plain sensible man, and in his public trust he was esteemed as a discreet, upright and faithful officer ; and he deserves a better character than many of superior birth and education. His son was deputygovernor after his death; his grandson and two of his great grandsons have been of the council for the province. 
Edward Winslow was of a very reputable family, and of a very active genius, which fitted him for employment abroad, and in a great measure prevented a competition between Bradford and him for the governor's place. He was concerned in managing their treaties with the Indians and with the neighbouring colonies, made several voyages to the eastward and to Connecticut river, as well as four or five voyages to England, in the service of the colony first, and afterwards of the Massachusetts; and so established himself in the favour of the then supreme authority in England, as to be employed in some very important services. In 1651 he was one of the commissioners of Haberdasher'shall, as they were called, from the place of meeting; and, in 1655, was one of the three superintendants in Cromwell's West India expedition. In one of his embassies, viz. in 1635, he had a difficult task to manage in England ; the particular circumstances his friend Bradford has preserved from oblivion, though they are too prolix to be inserted here. 
Mr. Winslow's son was first an assistant, then governor of the colony ; his grandson one of the council for the province, and many years at the head of the county of Plymouth ; one of his great grandsons lost his life fighting for his country ; two others filled offices of honour and trust, and there are now many reputable branches of the name and family in different parts of the province. 
William Brewster was highly esteemed by the whole company, was their ruling elder in Holland, which seems to have been the bar to his being their governor; civil and ecclesiastical office, in the same person, being then deemed incompatible. Mr. Bradford gives this account #f him : " After he had attained the knowledge  of the Latin tongue, and some insight into the Greek, and spent some small time at Cambridge, and then, being first seasoned with the seeds of grace and virtue, he went to the court, and served that religious and godly gentleman Mr. Davison, divers years, when he was secretary of state; who found him so discreet and faithful, that he trusted him above all other that were about him, and only employed him in all matters of greatest trust and secrecy. He esteemed him rather as a son than a servant, and for his wisdom and godliness, in private, he would converse with him more like a friend and familiar than a "master. He attended his master when he was sent in ambassage by the queen to the Low Countries, in the Earl of Leicester's time. He afterwards remained with him till his trouble, when he was put from his place about the death of the Queen of Scots, and some time after, doing him many faithful offices and services in the time of his troubles. Afterwards he went and lived in the country, in good esteem among his friends and the gentlemen of those parts, especially the godly and religious. He was the chief of those that were taken at Boston, and suffered the greatest loss. After he came into Holland he suffered much hardship, having spent most of his means, having a great charge and many children; and, in regard of his former breeding and course of life, not so fit for many employments as others were, especially such as were toilsome and laborious. In the latter part of the time spent in Holland, his outward condition was mended. He fell into a way, by reason he had the Latin tongue, to teach many students who had a desire to learn the English tongue, for he drew rules to learn it, after the Latin manner ; and many gentlemen, both Danes and Germans, resorted to him, as they had time from their other studies, some of them being great men's sons. Removing into this country, these things were laid aside, and a new course of living must be submitted to, in which he was no waj unwilling to take his part and to bear his burthen with the rest, living many times without bread or corn many months together, many times having nothing but fish, and often wanting that also; and drank nothing but water for many years together, yea, till within five or six years of his death, and yet he lived, by the blessing of God, in health till very old age, &c." He lived until 1643, and then died at the age of 84. 
William Brewster, grandson of the above, was deacon of the church atDuxbury. Many of his posterity, we are informed, are living in that colony.]  

PLYMOUTH.  ("Isaac Allerton or Alderton, the first assistant, Was employed several times to negociate matters in England, relative to their trade, and at length left them and settled there. His male posterity settled in Maryland. If they be extinct, Point Alderton, which took his name, will probably preserve it many ages. 
Miles Standish, is said by Morton, to have been ' a gentleman of Lancashire, heir to a great estate, surreptitiously detained from him; his great grandfather being a second or younger brother of the house of Standish.' He had been a soldier in the Low Countries, and was thought, although of remarkable small stature, the most f>roper person for their chief military officer, as ong as he lived. Many things are said of his notable strength and courage. It is said, that when the news of the first Indians being killed, by him, came to Mr. Robinson in Holland, he wrote to his church ' to consider the disposition of their captain, who was of a warm temper, and whom he hoped the Lord had sent among them for good, if they used him right;' but Mr. Robinson doubted, ' whether there was not wanting that tenderness of the life of man, made after God's image, which was meet,' and he thought it would have been a happy thing, ' if they had converted some before they had killed any.' It seems Standish was not of their church at first ; and Mr. Hubbard says, he had more of his education in the school of Mars than in the school of Christ. He acquired, however, the esteem of the whole colony, and died in 1656, much lamented. His farm in Duxbury retains the name of Captain's Hill to this day, and some part of it yet remains in the possession of one of his posterity. 
William White was remarkable for being the father of the firstborn child, Peregrine White, who lived until 1704. 
Stephen Hopkins was one of the assistants, and seems to have been much employed in their public affairs. Purchase mentions one Stephen Hopkins, one of Sir George Somers's company at Bermudas, as being disaffected to their civil and ecclesiastical regulations, and a promoter of separation, and not unlikely to be the same person. He was the ancestor of Mr. Hopkins of Providence, the present Governor of Rhode Island. 
Richard Warren is mentioned by Bradford, as a most useful man among them, the short time he lived; dying in 1628; his son, grandson, and great grandson, have been since employed in public posts in the colony and province. 

VOL. IV.  
John Alden was many years an assistant, and several of his descendants have sustained public offices, and some of them are now living : so are the descendants of John Howland. Of the rest of this company we can give little or no account. 
Timothy Hatherly, indeed, was a merchant of London, engaged with them from the beginning, and came over two or three years after the first. He was the principal founder of the town of Scituate, and was an assistant : so was Thomas Willet, who came from London in 1629, and was a principal trader with the Dutch at Manhadbs, and in such esteem with them, that they chose him a referree to settle their controverted boundary with the colony of Newhaven. He lived many years after, and died at Swanzey. His son was one of the first settlers of the Naraganset country, in the beginning of last century; and his grandson, Francis Willet, Esq. was a person of distinguished character in that colony. 
William Thomas, Edmund Freeman, James Cudworth, Thomas Southworth, were all assistants, and their families still remain in the colony. 
We must not, however, omit taking notice of Richard Bourne, an early settler, and a most zealous and indefatigable promoter of the gospel among the Indians ; and though we do not find him named in the magistracy himself, yet two of his descendants have been of the council for the province, and several more are now living, of very reputable characters, and distinguished by posts of honour and trust. 
These were the founders of the colony of New Plymouth. The settlement of this colony occasioned the settlement of Massachusetts Bay, which was the source of all the other colonies of New England. Virginia was in a dying state, and seemed to revive and flourish from the example of New England. We are not preserving from oblivion the names of heroes, whose chief merit is the overthrow of cities, provinces, and empires, but the names of the founders of a flourishing town and colony, if not of the whole British empire in America. Such then were the leading characters who drew up and signed the instrument already mentioned, for the purpose of providing against any disputes which might arise through want of a due subordination upon their first landing. 
By this instrument they formed themselves into a proper democracy, and, if they had gone no further, perhaps they would have done but little towards preserving order. But one great reason of this covenant seems to have been of a]

[mere moral nature, that they might remove all scruples of inflicting necessary punishments, even capital ones, seeing all had voluntarily subjected themselves to them. By common consent they agreed upon Mr. John Carver to be their first governor, "confiding in his prudence, that he would not adventure upon any matter of moment without consent of the rest, or, at least, advice of such as were known to be the wisest among them." (Hubbard.) They seem cautiously to have reserved as much of their natural liberty as could be consistent with the maintenance of government and order. This was rational, and every thinking man, when he first quitted the state of nature, would do the same. Lord Chief Justice Holt said, in the case of Blankald versus Galdy, that in case of an uninhabited country newly found out by English subjects, all laws in force in England are in force there, and the court agreed with him. Until they should agree upon laws suited to their peculiar circumstances, our Plymotheans resolved to make the laws of England their rule of government, which, Mr. Hubbard says, " they were willing to be subject unto, although in a foreign land;" and it seems they differed much in this respect from the Massachusetts colonists, and never established any distinct code or body of laws, but " added some particular municipal laws of their own, suitable to their constitution, in such cases where the common law and the statutes of England could not well reach and afford them help in emergent difficulties, following the advice of Pacuvius to his neighbours of Capua, not to cashier their old magistrates till they could agree upon better to place in their room." Cartwright, who had a chief hand in reducing puritanism to a system, held, that the magistrate was bound to adhere to the judicial law of Moses, and might not punish nor pardon, otherwise than they prescribed, and him the Massachusetts people followed. 
It must be allowed that, in some instances, the Plymotheans ran into the same errors with the Massachusetts, and established penalties disproportioned to the offences. A young factor, who came from Virginia, was captivated with the charms of an Indian girl, and the effects of a criminal conversation soon appeared. He found suspicions rising against him, and had no other way to avoid whipping but to leave the colony. Accordingly he privately departed to the colony from whence he came, where we suppose his offence would not have been thought very heinous. But the fact was, that these people thought the  magistrates, being God's ministers, were bound to punish all offences in their courts in the same proportion as the supreme Judge would punish them in the court of heaven. 
They had no scruples of their authority, by virtue of their combination, to inflict corporal punishment for lesser offences. They had been 10 years combined before any capital offence was committed. In 1630, John Billington, who had slipped in among them when they were at London, not being one of their church, lay in wait for his companion, with whom he was offended, and wounded him, so that he died presently after. They were in doubt of their authority to pass sentence of death. They had just obtained their patent from the council of Plymouth, which gave all the powers which they had authority to give ; but if the council, by their patent, had no authority to inflict capital punishment themselves, it might well be inquired, how they could give this power to their substitutes. Their chief reliance, therefore, seems to have been upon the voluntary submission of this offender, among the rest, to the laws and orders of the whole body. This, from a mere moral consideration, might induce them to proceed to trial and punishment; but, as they were within the dominions of Great Britain, and had no constitutional authority to erect courts of justice, scruples of the legality still remained. They therefore applied to their neighbours in the Massachusetts, and prayed their advice. Mr. Winthrop, having consulted with " the ablest gentlemen there," concurred with the opinion at Plymouth, that the man ought to die, and " the land be purged from blood." This was founded upon the divine command, " Whosoever sheddeth man's blood," &c. which was not in any case to be dispensed with. Although they were not clothed with legal authority, they observed, nevertheless, the forms of law, and both grand jury and petty jury were impannelled, and, after indictment, verdict and sentence, the criminal was executed. 
Mr. Carver, the first governor, died suddenly,, a few months after their arrival. They chose William Bradford to succeed him, and Isaac Allerton his assistant; but gave this reason for choosing an assistant, that Mr. Bradford was upon recovery from a fit of sickness, and unable to bear the whole burden ; however, it served for a precedent, and the same persons were annually elected governor and assistant until 1624, when they added four persons more for assistants, and gave the governor a double voice, and in]   PLYMOUTH.  f 1633 two more; after which they kept to the number of seven assistants, until they submitted to Kin<>- James II. his commission to Andros. In 70 years they had no more than six different persons governors. 
Bradford, who succeeded Carver, was chosen annually from 1621, until he died in 1657, except in 1633, 1636, and 1644, when Edward Winslow was chosen, and 1634, when Thomas Prince was chosen; who also succeeded Bradford, and was annually elected, until his death in 1673; when Josias Winslow succeeded, and continued until he died in 1680 ; and was succeeded by Thomas Hinkley, who held the place, except in the interruption by Andros, until the junction with the Massachusetts in 1692. 
We do not find when they first chose a deputygovernor, or gave an assistant the name of deputygovernor, for we know of no peculiar share of power ; but, in the latter part of the patent, William Bradford, son to the first governor, is named deputygovernor. The charters of the three New England charter governments mentioning such an officer, probably led them to a conformity. They had no house of representatives until the year 1639, when committees or deputies were sent from each town ; viz. four from Plymouth, two from Duxborough, two from Scituate, two from Sandwich, two from Cohannet (Taunton), two from Yarmouth, two from Barnstable. (Colony Records.) There seems to have been no occasion for a house of representatives before. Their number was small, the election of governor and assistants annual ; they were, to all intents and purposes, the representatives of the people; and indeed, when the colony increased, the increasing the number of assistants might have answered all the purposes of choosing the same number, with another name. The Massachusetts had some special reasons, which Plymouth had not. They were limited by charter to 18 assistants. The people were not satisfied that the whole powers of government should be in so few hands. They could have a remedy in no other way than by creating a distinct body of men, to share with the governor and assistants in acts of government. The Massachusetts, from the beginning, endeavoured to preserve two distinct ranks or orders of men, gentry and commonalty. There was a general disposition to elect the governor, &c. from the former rank; their ministers preached it as a christian and moral duty. That the commonalty, or, as they expressed themselves, the generality, might come in for a share, they formed a new body, by the name of  representatives, although their charter knew nothing of it. 
Whilst they were few in number, so that the whole body could assemble in one place, the whole were frequently convened, to determine upon matters executive as well as legislative. When they were increased, and were divided into towns remote from the centre, this became im* practicable. They then seem to have followed the model of the Massachusetts, the governor and assistants being the supreme judiciary power, and sole in judging high offences ; lesser offences being cognizable before inferior courts and single magistrates, and in civil matters appeals also lay from inferior jurisdictions to the supreme. 
We shall briefly touch upon their ecclesiastical affairs. We suppose this people were the first who took or received the name of Independents, which, in a few years after, was the name given to a body of men in England, who assumed the government there. When they first went to Holland they were known by the name of Brownists. Some of the characteristics of Brownism they afterwards disclaimed, and, at the same time, disclaimed the name, which was generally odious ; the character of the founder of the sect being, at best, problematical. Besides, he renounced his principles, and returned to episcopacy. The Puritans they could not conform to, and therefore considered themselves as a distinct church or by themselves, independent of all other. Cardinal Bentivoglio makes them a distinct sect in Holland, by the name of Puritans, though he was unacquainted with their inducement to leave England, and supposes it commerce and not religion. (I Puritani ancora vi son tolerati, che sono i piu puri e i piu rigidi Calvinisti, i quali non vogliono riconoscere autorita alcuna ne' magistrati politici sopra il governo de' loro ministri heretici, e sono quasi tutti de' Puritani d'lnghilterra, che per occasion di commercio frequentan l'Ollanda, e le altro Provincie Unite. Delia relatione delle Provincie, Sfc.) 
The Massachusetts people refined and took the name of Congregationalists, although it will perhaps be difficult, at this day, to show any material difference between the churches of the two colonies ; for although Plymouth never established, by act of government, the Massachusetts platform, yet in practice they seem generally to have conformed to it. 
Whilst they expected their minister from Holland, they were without the sacraments, they had constant public worship, their pious elder generally praying and preaching, or, as they then]

[termed it, prophesying, and sometimes one or other of the brethren best gifted or qualified. After their minister's death, they made trial of four or five; but some were of bad morals, others of principles not approved, and others met with better offers, so that they had no minister settled to their satisfaction until Mr. John Reyner came among them, in the year 1636. The whole colony made but one church until the year 1633, when those brethren who lived on the side of the bay opposite to the town, where Duxbury now is, broke from the rest, because of the difficulty of travel, and became a distinct society. -Perhaps their being so long without a minister at first, might be the reason why they were less anxious to be furnished with ministers, immediately upon their spreading and forming new towns and settlements, than their neighbours in Massachusetts and Connecticut. 
Considering the rapid increase of the Massachusetts and Connecticut, it may not be amiss to give the reasons of the very slow growth of Plymouth ; for in 13 or 14 years the whole colony was not become too numerous for one middling town. They had pitched upon some of the poorest land in New England, and had frequent thoughts of quitting it. In 1623, their brethren write from Leyden, and desire that, seeing by God's providence " that place fell to their lot, they would not leave it, nor languish after other places, though they had discovered more rivers and more fertile places than where they were;" but, in 1633, they took possession of Connecticut river, and built and fortified a house for trade, where Hartford now is; and afterwards, when the Massachusetts dispossessed them, they urged, among other reasons for holding possession, that " they lived upon a barren place, where they were by necessity cast, and neither they nor theirs could long continue upon the same, and why should they be deprived of that which they had provided and intended to remove to, as soon as they were able?" 
In the next place, the plan they set out upon was not to make a great colony in a little time, but to preserve a pure and distinct congregation ; they neither desired any people of a different persuasion to mix with them, nor did any such incline to go among them. When one of the number was hanged, 10 years after the settlement began, it was remarked that he had been a profane person, and guilty of other miscarriages before that for which he suffered, and that by means of some of his friends in London, he had been shuffled in among them. If all in England,  who called themselves Brownists and IndepefH dents, at that day, had come over with them, they would scarcely have made one considerable town. Indeed, a few years after, most of those who had before been called Puritans, were willing enough to own the same principles with them, though they did not like the name. 
We may add one cause more, viz. that their views, when they left England, were rather to establish a factory than a colony. They had no notion of cultivating any more ground than would afford their own necessary provisions, but proposed that their chief secular employment should be commerce with the natives ; and they entered into contract with a company of 20 or more merchants and others, many of them belonging to Bristol, who were to furnish them with goods ; and, at the end of seven years, the profits were to be divided equally between the merchants in England and the colonists, all the houses and improved land to be valued in the joint stock. This last circumstance was a sufficient bar to any extraordinary improvement of the lands. Here we cannot help remarking, that they had a fine opportunity of making fortunes, having few or no rivals ; whilst the Indians were charmed with European goods, as well to adorn as to clothe themselves, and goods sold at great advance, and the furs came cheap ; though it is fair to acknowledge, that a variety of misfortunes and losses by sea, for severalyears together, kept the balance against them. They were but little acquainted with trade, and perhaps they were not so worldlyminded as their posterity have since been. At first they made every man a partner. Every man's person was valued at £10 interest in the stock, and his whole time was to be employed for the common benefit. He that had £90 in the general stock, with the addition of £10 for his person, was to share ten times as much as he who had no substance at all. This was a hard bargain for the poor, and we should not wonder if persons who could bring no money to put in the stock were discouraged from settling among them. After the expiration of the seven years, and a settlement with their partners in England, the principal persons were obliged to become bound for the balance which remained in the hand of the colony or factory, and from that time took the trade into their own hands, exclusive of the poorer sort, who had spent seven years in labour and toil, and had received subsistence only, and that oftentimes scarce enough. 
They had for eight or ten years almost the whole supply of the Indians who were near].

PLYMOUTH.  [nei°hbours to them, but their greatest expectations' were from the eastern Indians; and they set up a truckhouse at Penobscot and another upon Kennebeck river. The latter they found most advantageous, and sought for a grant of a convenient tract from the council of Plymouth, which they obtained in the year 1628, but it was " so strait and illbounded," that the next year, 1629, when a grant was made of the lands intended for the whole colony, the tract of country at Kennebeck was granted anew, and the limits enlarged. They met with some opposition in 1634, from persons employed by Lord Say and Lord Brook, who claimed a right of trading at the same place with the Plymouth people, we suppose by a grant from Gorges ; and a fray happened, in which one was killed on each side. Lord Say's company were Puritans, -and those of Plymouth Independents. This grant upon Kennebeck, within a few years past, from a different construction of the words which describe the limits, has been the cause of great contention. Perhaps the relation of this action, by Governor Bradford, may afford some light in the controversy. We shall therefore insert it, exactly as the words and points stood in his manuscripts. 
' I am now (he writes) to enter upon one of the saddest things that befell them since they come. But before I begin it will be needful to premise such parte of their patente as gives them right and priviledge at Kenebeck. As followeth. The said counsell hath further given, granted, bargained, sold, infeoffed, allotted, assigned and set over, and by these presents, doe clearly and absolutely give, grant, bargane, sell, alliene, enffeofe, allote, assigne and confirme unto the said William Bradford, his heirs, associates, and assignes. All that tracte of land or part of New England in America afforesaid, which lyeth within or betweene, and extendeth it selfe, from the utmost limits of Cobiseconte which adjoyneth to the river of Kenebeck towards the westerne ocean, and a place called the falls of Nequamkick in America aforesaid, And the space of 15 English myles, on each side of the said river, commonly called Kenebeck river, and all the said river called Kenebeck, that lyeth within the said limits and bounds eastward, westward and northward and southward, last above mentioned ; and all lands, grounds, soyles, rivers, waters, fishing, &c. And by vertue of the authority to us derived by the said late Majesty's Lettres patent to take, apprehend, seise, and make prise of all «uch persons their ships and goods, as shall at-  temptc to inhabite, or trade, with the savage people of that countrie within the several! presincts, and limits of his, and their several plantations, &c. 
' Now it so fell out that one Hocking, belonging to the plantation of Piscataway, wente with a barke, and comodities to trade in that river, and would needs press into their limits, and not only so but would needs goe up the river above their house (towards the falls of the river) and intercept the trade that should come to them. He that was cheefe of the place forbad them and prayed him that he would not offer them that injurie, nor go about to infringe their liberties, (which had cost them so dear) but he answered he would go up and trade there in dispite of them, and lye there as longe as he pleased ; the other told them he must then be forced to remove him from thence, or make seasure of him if he could. He bid him do his worste, and so wente up and anchored there. The other took a boat and some men, and went up to him, when he saw his time, and againe entreated him to departe, by what persuasion he could. But all in vaine, he could get nothing of him but ill words. So he considered that now was the season for the trade to come downe, and if he should suffer him to lye, and take it from them, all their former charge would be lost, and they had better throw up all. So consulting with his men, (who were willing therefor) he resolved to put him from his anchores, and let him drive down the river with the streame ; but commanded the men that none should shoote a shote upon any occasion except he commanded them. He spoake to him again but all in vaine, then he sent a cuple in a canow to cutte his cable, the which one of them performes, but Hocking takes up a pece which he had layded ready, and as the barke shered by the canow he shot him close under her side, in the head (as I take it) so he fell down dead instantly. One of his fellows (which loved him well) could not hold, but with a musket shot Hocking, who fell down dead and never spoake word ; this was the truth of the thing ; the rest of the men carried home the vessel and the sad tidings of these things. Now the Lord Saye and the Lord Brooke with some other great persons had a hand in this plantation ; they write home to them, as much as they could to exasperate them in the matter ; leaving out all the circumstances, as if he had been killed without any offence of his parte, conceling that he had killed another first, and the just occasion that he had]    PLYMOUTH.  
[given in offering such wrong ; at which their Lordships were much offended till they were truly informed of the matter.' (Bradford's MS.) But to return to our history — Two or three years after the arrival of our colonists, all things were in common, no man having any property but what was put into the common stock, and every person furnished with clothing and provisions out of this stock. A certain quantity of land in the beginning of the year was assigned for planting, and every one had such a proportion of the labour assigned him. Mr. Bradford remarks, upon this occasion, that the ill success of this community of goods, even among godly and sober fully evinced the vanity of that conceit of Plato, that the taking away property and bringing in community into a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing : and, in fact, they raised so little provisions, that once, at least, they were in danger of starving ; and, before their crops were fully ripe, great part would be stolen out of the fields, to satisfy hungry bellies, and severe whipping of the offenders would not deter others in the like circumstances from committing the like offence. Besides, it occasioned constant discontent and murmuring, as the young men, most capable of labour, who had no families, thought much of labouring for other men's wives and children, whilst those in their full strength, complained that it was unjust to allow them no more in the division of victuals and clothing than them who were weak and could not do a quarter part of the labour : again, the aged and grave men thought it an indignity and disrespect to be upon a level, as in labour so in victuals and clothes, with the younger, and those in other respects of inferior condition. Husbands could not brook it that their wives should be commanded to do menial services, dressing meat, washing clothes, &c. for other men. All being obliged to do, and all accustomed to receive alike, it was inferred that, in all other respects, they ought to be alike, and one man was to all intents and purposes as good as another, and no subordination, no civil distinction could be preserved. After three years, they found it absolutely necessary to come into some new measures, and began with assigning to each family a certain quantity of land, sufficient to raise corn enough for their support, but in all other respects to continue in the general way, until the seven years for which they had contracted with their partners in England for the profits of their labour were expired. There was immediately a  new face upon their affairs, much more corn was planted than the governor, by the exertion of all his authority, could ever cause them to plant in any year before. Women and children, who were weak and unable before, went cheerfully with their husbands and parents to plant corn, and every family had enough for their support, and many of them some to spare. An emulation was created and increased every year to exceed in quantity, and in a few years they were able to raise sufficient to make it a valuable article in their Indian trade, being then worth 6s. sterling a bushel. The Indians now, in a great measure, left off raising it, the hunting life being more agreeable to them, and finding, as they did, that with their furs they could purchase what they wanted. 
The colony had struggled for seven or eight years, and had made but small improvements in cultivating the ground, and was not numerous enough to think of dividing and extending to the inland parts of the country when Mr. Endicot arrived at Salem to prepare the way for the grand undertaking of settling the Massachusetts. This must have given fresh spirits to the Plymotheans. Without this, we think, there is great reason to question whether the plantation would not in a few years have been deserted, and the settlers have removed to some more fertile part of America, or, which is more probable, have returned to England, where, from the change of times, they might have enjoyed civil and religious liberty, for the sake of which they first quitted it, in as great a latitude as their hearts could wish. 
In a small colony it cannot be expected that we should meet with many events of moment after they had grappled with the hardship which attended their first settlement. Mr. Bradford remarks, that the Spaniards were thought by Peter Martyr to have suffered hardships which none but a Spaniard could endure, when they were obliged to live for five days together upon the parched grain of maize only, and that not to satiety, whereas the Plymotheans the first two or three years thought a meal of their maize as good as a feast ; and sometimes not for five days only, but for two or three months together, were destitute of that and all other corn or bread of any kind. But with their miseries, he says, they opened a way to these new lands, for other men to come afterwards with ease and inhabit them. The fourth year after their arrival, they were threatened with the total destruction of their crop, and absolute famine. From about the]  

PLYMOUTH.  fmiddle of May to the middle of July, they had not one shower of rain, and the extreme heat of the sun upon their sandy soil had so dried up their corn, that they were almost in despair of its ever being restored ; but in the evening after a day of fasting and prayer it began to rain, and by repeated showers their corn recovered its verdure, and they had a plentiful harvest. They afterwards found by experience that such droughts are frequent in this climate ; but a kind Creator has so ordered the seasons, that these droughts have always been followed, before the end of the summer, with refreshing rains ; and, although the fruits of the earth have been much diminished, yet harvest hath never failed ; men and beasts have been supported, and ordinarily, in the next succeeding year, there has been a remarkable plenty. 
The terror which firearms struck into the Indians, prevented them from destroying this small company. There were not above seven men capable of bearing arms in the time of sickness the first winter. Soon after the potent nation of Naraganset sent to the English a bundle of arrows tied with a snake's skin, as a defiance and denunciation of war. . The English filled the skin with bullets, and sent it back with this answer ; that they had done them no wrong, did not fear them, and were provided for them come when they would. The Naragansets would not suffer the bullets to come near them, and they were moved about from place to place, till they found their way back to the English again, and the Indians remained quiet. As the Indians learned the use of firearms, the English increased in number, and until the year 1675, there was no open rupture, except the short offensive war with the Pequots in their own country, which ended in their destruction. 
However rigid the New Plymouth colonists may have been at their first separation from the church of England, yet they never discovered that persecuting spirit which we have seen in the Massachusetts. When Mrs. Hutchinson and her adherents were banished from that colony, they applied to the colony of Plymouth for leave to settle upon Aquidnick or Rhode Island, which was then acknowledged to be within Plymouth patent, and it was readily granted, although their tenets were no more approved by Plymouth than by the Massachusetts. Some of the Quakers also fled to Plymouth bounds, and probably saved their lives ; for although laws were made severe enough against erroneous opinions, yet were these in no case capital. The Baptists also were  still more favourably received; the town of Swansey being principally settled by Baptist refugees from the Massachusetts colony, and when one of their ministers settled in the church of Plymouth, they were content that he should baptize by immersion, or dipping any who desired it, provided he took no exception to the other minster's sprinkling such for whom immersion was not judged necessary. 
Until 1629, they were in doubt about their title to their lands. They were constantly soliciting a grant, or, as they term it, an assurance from the council of Plymouth. In 1624, they employed one John Pierce, who procured a grant to himself for about £50, but he kept it in his own hands, and refused to assign it for less than ^£500. This they justly complained of as a great breach of trust, and attributed to it several losses and disappointments he met with in his intended voyage, which frightened him and made him also look upon them as the punishment of his perfidy and to relinquish his claim. We do not find that those who employed him reaped any benefit from the grant. After they had their patent in 1629, they were easy until the restoration ; but when Connecticut and Rhode Island, who held their lands, or most of them, under patents from the council of Plymouth, thought it necessary to solicit, and had obtained a royal confirmation and charter, giving authority to govern, New Plymouth solicited also, but they were rather too late. The court began to be jealous of the colonists. Such sort of charters as had been granted left them, it was said, too much to themselves, and although they were not peremptorily refused, they were put off from time to time, and told that the only difficulty was to settle such a form of government as should secure their dependence as a colony, and should nevertheless afford to them liberties and privileges to their satisfaction. 
This was no easy matter for both sides to agree upon, and thus a state of suspense made the colony more pliable and obsequious than their neighbours of Massachusetts. This was particularly the case when the commissioners from King Charles came to New England in 1664, and when Plymouth submitted to their determination a controversy between that colony and Rhode Island about bounds. At this time they received, indeed, a very gracious letter from the king, but all ended in mere professions.— We can easily conceive of a parent state growing every day more and more popular in its government, and nevertheless at the same time re-]    PLYMOUTH.  
[straining the liberties of its colonies for the sake of continuing the connection ; but when there is a scheme of establishing absolute power in the parent state, how can it be expected that popular governments should be established in the colonies ? However, no advantage was ever taken of their want of authority, and their proceedings were connived at until the general shipwreck of charters in 1684, when an arbitrary government was established in the other colonies, and they could not expect to escape. All their hopes being at an end, they made as loud complaints of oppression, under Andros, as any people of his government, and perhaps with as much reason ; and when the Massachusetts imprisoned him and reassumed their charter, Plymouth assumed their old form of government also. Now it was that they first sensibly found the want of a charter. Connecticut and Rhode Island, who had resigned their charters, were justified, by the example of the corporations in England, in assuming them again ; but Plymouth had none to assume. Their first attempt was to procure a charter and to continue a distinct government. In this they could not succeed. Perhaps, if it had been solicited in the best manner, they might have succeeded, but interior divisions prevented any proper measures being pursued. Mr. Hink- - ley, their governor, wrote to Mr. Mather, the Massachusetts agent, to desire him to solicit in their behalf, but the people refused to advance any money, and so small a sum as £ 200 sterling could not be raised. The inhabitants of some of the principal towns subscribed, upon condition the whole sum should be raised. Some of the towns refusing, the whole subscription failed. Such was the effect of their divisions, that neither party would acknowledge the au- . thority of the government when any act passed which they did not approve of. Mr. Wiswall, one of their ministers, by advice of some gentlemen in Boston, went to England, but having no commission, and, which is more fatal to those who have affairs at court, no money, he never could make a public appearance, and served only to give offence to the ministry, by offering exceptions to the proposal of joining Plymouth to the Massachusetts, and, eventually, occasioned their being annexed to New York. It is said, however, that they were taken out of Slaughter's commission by Mr. Mather's interest ; for although Slaughter arrived at New York the year before Phipps arrived in the Massachusetts, and sent his orders to Little Compton in Plymouth colony, in terms as high and authoritative as if  he had been their governor, or depended upon being such; yet was their junction with New York suspended until they were actually included in the Massachusetts. 
It has been said this last determination gave, and continues to give, to this day, great satisfaction to every individual in the colony of Plymouth, and that there is not one who does not think it a most happy circumstance that they were annexed to Massachusetts rather than to New York. There might, indeed, at first, have been jealousies of unequal distinctions, upon some occasions, in favour of the Massachusetts, yet they have long since been at an end, and the customs, manners, and religious opinions of the two colonies being much the same, they mutually consider themselves as having one joint general interest as fully in all respects as if they had been one colony from the beginning.

==[[Popa|POPA]]==, Nuestra Senora de la, a sanctuary and convent of the barefooted Augustins, in the province and government of Cartagena, of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada. It is a quarter of a league from that city, on the top of a very lofty mountain of the figure of a galley ; and which, being looked upon by the part where the convent stands, resembles the poop of the same ; from whence it has its name. Fr. Antonio Calancha asserts that it was full of woods, and abounded exceedingly in monkeys and reptiles ; serving also as a place of refuge for criminals ; to whom the devil was said to appear under the name of Busiraco : also that this infernal spirit had entered into a compact with a certain Mustee, named Luis Andrea ; who was punished by the Inquisition of that city in 1613 ; when he con^- fessed his guilt, and stated his vile agent to have been concerned in that terrible tempest and hurricane which arose at the founding of the convent of the Santisimo Sacramento, by the Father Vicente Mayon.

==[[Popayan|POPAYAN]]==, a province and government of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada in S.America; bounded n. by the province of Los Llanos de Nieva, n. e. by that of Cagualan, w. by that of Raposo, and s. by that of Pastos of the kingdom of Quito. It is 128 leagues long from n. to s-. and nearly 100 wide from e. to w. and is one of those provinces called Equinoctial, from its immediation to the line, and being of a country, for the most part, mountainous and rough, although not without beautiful and extensive valleys which are very fertile. The climate is, generally speaking, moderately hot, but in the sierras it is proportionably cold. It was much larger before the provinces of Choc(>, Antioquia, and Neiva, were separated from it and formed into separate governments. This province is divided into various small jurisdictions or districts. It was discovered and conquered by Sebastian de Belalcazar in 1536, at the expense of great labours, combats, and fatigues, occasioned by the Indian natives, the Pacces, Pijaos, Xamundis, Timbas, Guanbas, Malvasaes, Polinderas, Palacees, Tembios, and Golazas ; who were most valorous and warlike, and governed by their caciques Popayah and Calambaz ; the province taking the name of the former. It is extremely fertile, and abounds In cattle, provisions of every kind, pulse, delicate fruits, sugar canes, of which they make much sugar, honey and brandy, tallow, ropes made of," Indian thread, tobacco and cotton- It maintains agreat commerce with the kingdom of Quito, sending clothes and fruits of Europe, which are carried to Cartagena in freetrading vessels, and taking in exchange cloths,, baizes, linen, woven cotton stuffs, and other manufactures of that country. It buys in money at Santa Fe the linens, which are finer than those of Quito, tanned leather, mantles, blankets, and some European articles. With the province of Choco it barters small coin for golddust, or such as is extracted from the washing places; although it sometimes gives in exchange all kind of European and native clothes,, iron, steel, flesh, cheese, and other provisions. The same province it also does with the provinces of. Antioquia, receiving in payment golddust. 
It has, itself, many mines of this elass, which, like all the others of this kingdom, are worked; by companies of Negro slaves; and in the territories of Neiva and Caloto are some very risfe    mines of silver, the working of which is even   P O P A Y A N.  now projected by Don Pedro Agustin de Valencia, native and inhabitant of Popayan, through the medium of the companies called the Accionistas. The only silver, which circulates now in this province, is that which comes from Quito, in the remittances to Cartagena ; and those who carry it there take in exchange dobloons, paying a reduced premium of two or three per cent. This province is watered by several large rivers ; but the greater of them is the Cauca, which enters the Grande de la Magdalena, and traverses this province. 
The mountains and woods abound in a variety of animals and birds, as also in exquisite trees. The most illustrious Den Lucas de Piedrahita asserts that it had 600,000 inhabitants when the Spaniards entered it; but that there was no town whatever; the inhabitants living on the tops of trees, changing their situation in tribes, like the Arabs. At the present day, the number of inhabitants, compared with its natural advantages, is very small ; for it has every thing that might render it one of the finest and most profitable provinces in all America. 
[The whole of the regular troops in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada (as appears bj r the Foreigners' Guide, published in Spain, in 1802), amounted to 3290, in which number is comprehended the garrison of this province, together with that of Panama, Cartagena, Quito, &c]

San Buenaventura, in the S. Sea, belonging to the province of Raposo, one of those of Choco, and 50 leagues from Popayan. The capital, of the same name, was founded by the discoverer and conqueror of the province, Sebastian del Belalcazar, in 1536, on an extensive and delightful llanera. In 1538 the king gave it the title of very Noble and very Loyal City, and for arms a shield having in one angle the sun in the middle of a city, and two rivers which surround it, with a tree above and another on the side of each river, and for orle four Jerusalem crosses. 
It was erected into a bishopric by his Holiness Paul III. in 1547, when the choir was composed of five dignitaries ; though now only of three, which are the dean, the maestreescuela, and treasurer, two canons of office, penitentiary and magisterial, two racioneros and two half racioneros. It is a suffragan to the archbishopric of Santa Fe. 
The town does not correspond with the great advantages offered by the territory and the excellence of the climate; since the population amounts to only 8000 souls, including Spaniards, people of different casts, the clergy, and nuns. [This enumeration was probably correct at the time Alcede wrote, but the population, even in 1802, amounted to upwards of 25,000 souls.] Popayan has the convents of the religious orders of S. Domingo, S. Agustin, of the Minis-   A Y A N.  tros Agouizantes of San Camilo de Lelis, a college of the missionaries of San Franciso, charged with the reduction of the Infidel Andaquies Indians, who dwell on the banks of the rivers Caqueta and Putumayo, the which is a community whose austere and rigorous observance of their institutes affords the most edifying example, and whose temple, which has been lately finished, is magnificent, adorned with images of devotion made at Quito, and precious ornaments and sacred vases ; an hospital of Bethlemites, founded by D. Christoval Botin, who was an inhabitant of this city ; two monasteries of nuns, one of barefooted Carmelites, the other of Calzadas Augustins, in the which there are upwards of 70 nuns, and 230 secular women and ladies, who choose to live retired. It also had a college of the Jesuits, with a seminary of collegiates, in which were professorships of Latin, philosophy and theology, moral and scholastical ; and, after the expulsion of this order from the kingdom, the same college fell under the charge of a secular clergyman, preserving only two of its professorships, and having about 20 or 24 collegiates, with eight fellowships, endowed by the king. In the time of the Jesuits, the higher degrees were conferred here ; and, now, for these they have recourse to the universities of Santa Fe and Quito, for the studies of theology, canons, and laws. The curacy of the cathedral wastran^ slated to the church of this college, from which it was before separated, and in which officiated a deputycurate, nominated by the prebends. At the present day it serves as a cathedral, from the former being in ruins, but the rebuilding of which is in agitation. Here is a relic of St. Barbara, to which particular respect is paid by the whole of the city ; also other insignia of different saints, which were brought hither from Rome, through the zeal and piety of the present prebend, D. Manuel Ventura Hurtado. Here are also two hermitages ; the one at the foot of the mountain called De Belen, which is at an extremity of the city, and the other, with this dedicatory title, upon the same mountain, and offering a beautiful prospect. 
The streets of this town are all drawn at straight lines, of sufficient width, and the plots of the houses are equal ; so that they have the appearance of a draughtboard; and the buildings are very good. Here are some very pretty small squares, and a beautiful grand square. The temperature, though there be a continual propensity to rain, is that of a continual spring, without any greater distinction between the sum-  mer and winter than that the rains are not so abundant in the months of June, July, and August. There is, however, a much fresher air than in the summer, from the prevalence during that season of the winds blowing from the part of the Sierra Nevada or Paramo of Purase, which is distant half a day's journey from Popayan. The settlements close to this Paramo are very cold, but there are others near the city very hot, so that they easily procure the fruits of both temperatures, such as melons, watermelons, apples of various kinds, peaches, strawberries larger than those of Europe, figs, calabashes, cucumbers, and many other fruits ; amongst the which the chirimoya deserves preference, from the delicacy of its flavour ; and some there are of this species from 10 to 12 lbs. It abounds also in every kind of green herb, in neat cattle, and excellent wheat, though the natives are far from encouraging its cultivation ; their attention being rather drawn to the working of the goldmines, so that they do not even gather sufficient corn for the consumption of the city; but provide themselves with flour from Almaguer, which is 20 leagues distant, and from Pasto, which is 50 ; and this too, when the grain of these places is of a very inferior sort. 
The tempests prevalent here, although very strong, are soon over, and then the heavens are quiet and serene. The same is the case with the earthquakes ; and from thence has arisen the proverb, " The sky, soil, and bread of Popayan." 
At the back of the town is a mountain covered with trees, called of the M, as it represents the form of this letter. The city is surrounded by the river Molino, and to pass this, there are two bridges of brick and mortar, at the two opposite extremes \ which are the wards of Callejon and that known by the name of Arrabal, which, with the hospital of the Bethlemites, is divided from the city by this river, the waters of which are very good and salutary. Moreover, it passes through the settlement of Yanaconas, a little more than a quarter of a league distant ; from whence it flows by an aqueduct, which was made at the expense of Don Pedro Agustin de Valencia, to carry the water to the Mint, founded at his expense, according to the celebrated contract made in 1749 ; although, through the obstacles thrown in by the interested parties at Santa Fe, metals were not wrought here until 1758, and even then, the litigations not being appeased^ the king ordered it to be shut up in 1761. 
After this, in justice to Valencia, it was ordered that every indemnification should be g'ixem  ==[[Popayan|POPAYAN]]==,  liim for the loss he might sustain. This was accordingly clone by the council of the Indies ; and the Mint was reopened in 1766, for the advantage of the royal treasury, and in 1770 the king determined to incorporate it with the crownrights, not without taking into his consideration the protection which was due to the family of Valencia, for the great difficulties and losses that this individual had sustained : and this influence was immediately felt by D. Francisco de Valencia, the eldest son, who, established in his father's properties, and vested with the appointment of Secretary to the Universal Dispatch of the Indies, was made Cross Pensioner of the Royal and distinguished Order of Charles III. his son too, Don Pedro de Valencia, was made Knight- Page of the Royal House, and he is now actually serving as Captain of the African Infantry Regiment. Also, in virtue of the celebrated contract between the same Don Francisco Valencia, the king determined, in 1687, that his son should be reinstated in all the rights of the family, and, as a compensation for the losses it had sustained, made him treasurer of the same Mint, with the annual revenue of 5000 dollars, in quality of master, for himself and for his heirs for ever. At present there are made in this Mint annually from seven to 8000 dollars in dobloons, and a small quantity in silver. After the erection of this Mint, a public fountain was made in the principal square, the water of which was supplied from the aqueduct above mentioned, and which was executed by Don Pedro Augustin de Valencia, and ceded gratuitously, as were also several houses and convents. At a short space from the city runs another small river of the name of Ejido, since it passes through this place ; and at a quarter of a league distance Is the abundant stream of the Cauca, very rapid and deep, now united with the Vinagre, a river so called from the acidity of its waters, and which communicates the same qualities to those of the Cauca. To pass this river the Indians had, in the time of their gentilism, a prodigious bridge, formed by an arch of reeds twined within each other, which reeds the Spaniards used to use for making shades ; and after this there was built here a bridge of wood, upon a foundation laid in the middle of the river, of stone and mortar: but on account of the detriment arising from the inattention in repairing the woodwork of the bridge, and the circumstance Of its lying 1 in the direct road to all the provinces, the city was obliged, in 1768, to rebuild it on an improved plan, suggested by the engineer and chief of Car-  tagena, Don Antonio de Arevalo, over a part where the river is only 24 yards across, at a small distance from the old bridge. 
The new bridge is of only one arch, resting, in the part towards the city, upon a rock, and in the other upon an artificial foundation ; and on this side is a causeway made, upon arches of 95 yards in extent, to equalize the road, and on the opposite side one of 32 yards. This work was undertaken through a contribution of the inhabitants ; but the sum thus procured not being equal to the purpose by 25,000 dollars, this difference was made up by Don Francisco Basilio de Angulo and Don Joseph Hidalgo, who were to be reimbursed by a toll upon the bridge ; and his majesty authorizing the profits so arising, after the satisfaction of their demands, to be carried to the profit of the city. 
By the ward of the Arrabal or Suburbs there still exists the bridge made of oziers, which is repaired by the Indians every two years. This is only for foot passengers ; but it is very secure, as having strong breastworks of the same oziers on both sides of it. 
The city of Popayan is ennobled by many great and rich families, descended from the first conquerors and settlers, as also by various other distinguished persons, who have passed over in different employs, and who are : Don Sebastian de Belalcazar, who married at Burgos Dona Maria de Herrera y Sarmiento ; the Captain Pedro de Velasco, descendant of the constables of Castille, married to Dona Catalina de Zuniga, daughter of the Marquis of Quintana ; Captain Diego del Campo, married to Dona Mariana del Campo Salazar ; Captain Francisco Mosquera de Figueroa, descendant of the Dukes of Feria and Alva, married to Dona Leonor de Velasco; Juan Lopez Cabron de Viscarra, native of Navarra, married to Dona Jues de Vergara, who was born at Sevilla ; Captain Francisco de Aranas, and others, of whom are descended the distinguished families existing in Popayan ; the natives of which place are prudent, economical, and of clear understandings ; are faithful in their dealings, and of great circumspection. This city is also the native place of Father Francisco de Figueroa, of the Jesuits, first martyr of the missions of the Maranon, and killed by the Cocamas Indians, at the entrance of the river Apena, in 1666 ; also of various illustrious men, who have filled the civil, military, and ecclesiastical stations of the kingdom. 
In 1735 an earthquake was experienced here, which destroyed many houses, and the greater   A Y A N.  part of the temples, and amongst the rest that of St. Domingo, which was rebuilt very sumptuously by the House of the Arboledas. [The population of this city, in 1802, amounted to 25,000 souls. It is 195 miles s. s, w. from Santa Fe, and the same distance n. n. e. from Quito, in lat. 2° 28' 38" n. and long. 76° SV 30" w.~]

==[[Portobello|PORTOBELLO]]==, a city and seaport of the kingdom of Tierra Firme, on the declivity of a mountain surrounding the port. The greater part of the houses are of wood ; although there be some which have the first body of stone : they are all large, and amount to about 130, which run in one long street ; this being intersected, however, with some other houses, and there being also some scattered about the mountain. It has two squares, one in front of the customhouse, which is of stone, and another opposite the parish church also of stone, and which is large, prettily adorned, and served by a parochial curate and other priests. There are other two churches, one which is a convent of the monks of La Merced, and another of those of San Juan de Dios, having under their charge the hospital ; but both these are poor and small, and nearly in a state of complete ruin. At the e. extremity of the city, and in the road which leads to Panama, is a place called Guinea ; this being where the Negroes dwell, as well the   bondmen as the slaves of both sexes ; and this spot was, during the trade carried on by the galleons, very thickly inhabited ; inasmuch as it was resorted to by the greater part of the neighbourhood, in order to let out their houses to the people of the galleons, and by the many artisans who came down from Panama. 
This city, which is but poorly inhabited, was in the time of the galleons one of the most populous in the world ; for its situation upon an isthmus of the two seas, the n. and s. the goodness of its port, and its vicinity to Panama, gave it the preference of all the other settlements of America for the celebration of the richest fair in the universe, and which was carried on nearly every year by the Spanish merchants of Spain and Peru. Immediately on the arrival at Panama of the fleet of Peru with its riches, the galleons of Cartagena dropped down to Portobello ; not doing it sooner in order to avoid many inconveniences, such as sickness and the exorbitant expences which arose from the vast concourse of people which used to assemble on the occasion ; when a moderate sized parlour and bed would cost 1000 dollars, and the houses let for 5000 or 6000. Scarcely did the sailors bring their vessels to anchor, but they formed with sails a large booth in the square of the town, where to disembark and lodge cargoes ; each one recognizing his own effects by his mark. At the same time was to be seen the arrival of large muledroves of 100 mules each, loaded with chests of gold and silver from Peru : some of these would lodge their valuable burdens in the customhouse, others in the square ; and it was, indeed, well worthy of admiration to see with what little disorder and confusion every thing was conducted amongst so great a diversity of men and characters ; robbery, murders, or any other less serious disturbances being entirely unknown on these occasions. -^ Again, the spectator who had just before been considering Portobello in a poor, unpeopled state, without a ship in its port, and breathing nothing but misery and wretchedness, would remain thunderstruck at beholding the strange alteration which takes place at the time of this fair. Now he would see the houses crowded with people, the square and the streets crammed with chests of gold and silver, and the port covered with vessels ; some of these having brought by the river Chagre from Panama the effects of Peru, such as cacao, bark, vicuna wool, Bezoa stone, and other productions of those provinces. He would see others bringing provisions from  

PORTOBELLO.  Cartagena ; and he would reflect that, however detestable might be its climate, this city was the emporium of the riches of the two worlds, and the most considerable commercial depot that was ever known. 
Scarcely have the merchants of Spain disembarked their merchandise, and those of Peru, attended by the president of Panama, arrived with their riches, than the general of the galleons and the deputies of the two trading parties proceed to regulate the prices of all the articles ; and this being once published nothing will alter. Thus the sales and exchanges used to be made in the course of 60 days, the time of the duration of the fair ; during which period the vessels laden with the newly purchased Spanish goods would proceed up the river Chagre, the same kind of articles being carried by land to Panama ; and the European merchants would begin to put aboard the treasures of America : the city at the end of the aforesaid period remaining in the same deplorable state as before. 
This port was discovered by Admiral Don Christoval Columbus in 1502; who, observing it to be so large, deep, and well sheltered, gave it  lower than ordinary, it is a certain indication of a storm : indeed this occurs almost daily, and the top of the mountain is scarcely ever visible or uncloudy. The climate of this city is bad in the extreme, for the heat is excessive ; and this is encreased by its peculiarity of situation, as being hemmed in on all sides by a lofty mountain, such as will not admit of a free passage for the air. — Again, the trees are so thick they will not permit the rays of the sun to penetrate the ground, and they, of course, prevent this from being ever sufficiently dried, although they admit the exudation of sufficient vapours to condense into clouds, and form deluging rains. Scarcely are these over, than the activity of the sun dries up such parts of the ground as lie exposed and uncovered by trees, and the atmosphere becomes again subject to strong exhalations : let then the sun but disappear, and it immediately rains again; and thus it is that, day and night, the heat is always the same and undiminished. These showers sometimes come accompanied with such tempests of thunder and lightning as to cause a general alarm ; and the terrifying peal will be prolonged in sullen echo through the Taverns of the moun-    tering of monkies of a thousand kinds which dwell therein. 
This continual intemperate state of the atmosphere, united to the fatigues and labours of the  the name of Puertobelo. Its entrance, though tains, and followed up with the outrageous chatthreequarters of a mile in width, was well defended by the castle of San Felipe de Todo Fierro, situate on the n. part; for the s. part being full of rocks, vessels were under a necessity of passing between these and the aforesaid fort, mariners, causes them to have a debilitating sweat ; and to recover their strength they have recourse to brandy, of which there is an extraordinary consumption ; and this spirit, together with the excess of toil ; in short a constant state of intoxication, and the natural malignity of the climate, ruin the best constitutions, and breed the most ruinous disorders. Thus the number of inhabitants of Portobello is extremely small, and the greater part is of Negroes and Mulattoes, the whites being very few. 
The provisions are scarce and dear, particularly so at the time of the fairs, though plenty were then brought from Panama and Cartagena. The only eatable abounding here is fish, which is of excellent quality and of all sorts. Water flows down in streams from the mountains; some passing without the city, and others through it ; and although the qualities of being light and easy to pass would render it estimable in any other place, in this country, destined to be unfortunate, and in which even what is good degenerates into evil, the circumstance of its subtilty and digestive powers is attended with .the prod »  where there is from 9 to 15 feet water. But in the s. part also, at the distance of 200 toises from the city, was another large castle, called De Santiago de la Gloria ; and opposite the city another castle, with the name of San Geronimo ; all which were built by the celebrated engineer Juan Baptists. Antoneli, by order of Philip II., and which were destroyed by the English admiral Vernon in 1742, who took the city. 
To the n.w. of the city is a small bay, called La Caldera, sheltered from every wind, and excellent for careening vessels. Amongst the mountains which surround the port from the castle of Todo Fierro, as far as the opposite part, is one very peculiar, not only on account of its height, but as being the barometer of the country, and as announcing all the changes of the seasons : it is called Capira, and is in the interior of the port, and in the road which leads to Panama : its top is perpetually covered with a very thick cloud, and they have a saying here of " calarse el gorro Capira,''' (Capira has put on his nightcap) ; since, when the cloud descends

As the woods closely surround the city, the tigers are accustomed to make frequent incursions by night through the streets ; carrying away fowls, pigs, and other domestic animals, and sometimes even human beings. The snakes are also very abundant, but the toads so as to exceed all belief; for when it has rained during the night more than usual, on the morrow the streets are covered with these reptiles ; so that it is scarcely possible to walk without treading upon them and beinobitten by them ; which, added to the noise they 3 make, renders them insufferably unpleasant. 
This city was peopled from the inhabitants of Nombre de Dios : founded by Diego Nicuesa ; the which having been many times ruined by the Indians of Darien, was by command of Philip II. translated to this spot in 1584, for the greater security and better situation of its commerce. The Duke of La Plata, viceroy of Peru, began to fortify it, but did not follow this up, judging that the three castles aforesaid, which were rebuilt in 1751, by the lieutenantgeneral Don Ignacio de Sala, a celebrated engineer and governor of Cartagena, were sufficient for its defence. It has experienced several invasions; the first in 1596, by the English pirate Francis Drake ; the second in 1668, by John Morgan ; the third in 1680, by John Spring ; the fourth in 1702, by two English ships of war and three bilanders ; the fifth, by the English admiral Edward Vernon, who took it through a capitulation in 1742, its governor being Don Juan de la Vega Retes ; and the sixth in 1745, when it was illtreated by the captain William Kinhills, who battered it with 5000 cannonballs to recover a prize he had lost, although he did not dare to disembark, as he had threatened.

Portobello, another port, of the province and captainship of Ilheos in Brazil ; between the river Duke and that of Santa Cruz. 

==[[Porto-Seguro|PORTO-SEGURO]]==, a province and captainship of Rey in Brazil ; bounded n. by the province of Los Ilheos, s. by that of Espiritu Santo, e. by the sea; and its jurisdiction terminating on the w. by the river Grande de San Francisco ; which serves it as a barrier. It was the first territory and port discovered by the Portuguese in this kingdom in 1500. It is very fertile and of a very hot climate;  delightful,  although   abounding in sugar canes, of which they make a considerable portion of sugar. Its extent is 54 leagues ; and it is watered by the rivers S. Antonio, Yucara, Caravelas, Macuripe, Maranepe, and Curubabo. It was ceded by the king of Portugal to Pedro de Campos Tourinho, native of the town of Viana, who passed to take possession of it, with his family and other noble families of that kingdom which accompanied him, and who disembarked in the same part, as did Pedro Alvarez Cabral its discoverer. He succeeded in all the engagements which he fought with the natives, and caused them to flee to the interior of the mountains. At his death, the heir to this province was his daughter Dona Leonor de Campos ; who sold it to Don J uan de Lancaster, first Duke of Aveiro, son of Don Jorge, Duke of Coimbra, grandmaster of the military orders of Santiago and Avis. 
The king of Spain and Portugal, Don Philip II. erected it into a marquisate in favour of Don Alonso de Lancaster, Marquis of Valdefuentes, son of the duke of Aveiro ; and to this house it belonged until 1758., when it was united to the crown. 
The governorgeneral, Luis Brito de Almeida, from intelligence he had received that there were in the interior of this province and on the confines of that of Espiritu Santo precious stones ; sent in search of the same Sebastian Fernandez Tourinho, who navigated with some companions by the river Dulce and by an arm of that called the Mandy, where he disembarked, pursuing his rout by land for many leagues, until he arrived at a lake, which, from its size, was called by the Indians, Mouth of the Sea : pushing still forward for 70 leagues, as far as where the river Dulce enters into another called Acesi ; he traversed the shores of this for 50 leagues further on, and found some quarries of stone of various colours between blue and green. The Indians, who were his guides, also affirmed that on the top "of the quarry were red and other coloured stones with veins of gold ; and that, at the foot of a sierra covered with trees, of more than a league long, there were some of the same sort. Here, indeed, he found an emerald and a zaphyr, both perfect ; and 70 leagues higher up, in another sierra, various green stones. 
It was asserted by the natives, that there were more of these, though much finer, in a mine of chrystal ; and this induced the governor to send out Antonio Diaz de Adorno, who, con-  

PORTO- SEGURO.  firming the account, namely, that from the sierra of crystal, eastward, there were to be found emeralds, and, westward, zaphyrs, brought home some as a proof, which were forthwith transmitted to the king. 
Just at this period the crown devolved on Philip II. king of Spain, and these discoveries were pushed no father ; those valuable spots remaining in the possession of the infidels, and the different routs which had been taken being so completely lost sight of, as never since to admit of discovery, notwithstanding the frequent search that has been made after them. 
There are in this province two towns, which are, that of its name, and that of San Antonio de las Caravellas ; and two leagues distant from the former is the church of Nuestra Senora de Ayda ; celebrated for the miracle of a copious fountain, which burst forth on a sudden from the rock when the church was building, and when there was a lack of water. 
[We have extracted the following description of the province of Porto-Seguro, of the manners of its inhabitants, and of its trade, manufactures, military establishments, &c. from the compendious little history by Mr. Grant. 
The trade from Brazil to Europe is chiefly carried on by three principal ports. These are, Grand Para, Bahia, or the Bay of Santos, and Rio Janeiro. Into the last of these are poured the treasures from the mines of the s. ; and from this port are exported the commodities of Porto- Seguro, Spiritu-Santo, and S. Vicente. 
The province of Porto-Seguro is bounded on the n. by the Rio Grande, which separates it from the captainship of the Ilheos ; and on the s. by that of Spiritu-Santo. 
Porto-Seguro, so denominated from its being a safe harbour, is formed by a ledge of rocks that stretch out from an extended point of the main, about a mile, in a direction parallel to the land, forming a natural mole. These rocks, which are dry at low water, terminate abruptly, and again appear at the distance of half a league. 
The space between these rocks is the bar or entrance to the harbour, over which, during high tides, the depth of water is about 20 feet ; but, within, it decreases to 12 feet. A little farther up, however, where a river disembogues itself into the harbour, the water again somewhat deepens. This port has a fine sandy bottom, terminating in a broad beach. 
On entering the port, the adjacent country  presents to the view a most delightful and variegated landscape. Close to the shore we behold a range of fishermen's cabins, shaded with luxuriant trees ; and in the back ground, extensive woods, intersected with paths leading to various sequestered habitations. To the n. rises a steep hill, on the summit of which stands the capital, termed, like the province, Porto- Seguro. 
Though, from its commanding situation, this city certainly has an elegant aspect at a distance, yet, on a nearer approach, its general appeaiance is mean and wretched. The streets are straight and sufficiently wide ; but they are irregularly disposed, and the houses, in general, low and illconstructed. Few of them are above one, and none of them exceed two stories ; they are built of a soft kind of brick, and covered over with plaster ; the windows are furnished with a kind of splitcane blinds, as a substitute for casements. 
There are no public edifices in Porto-Seguro deserving of attention. The townhouse is a large quadrangular building ; and the prison is also of considerable extent. There are only two churches in the city, one of which is a neat plain building, furnished with glass casements ; but the other is no way distinguished from the warehouses, except by having been erected of better materials, which are a mixture of stone and red brick. 
In 1550 a monastery of Franciscans was established, at the expence of the city, which has long since fallen into a state of decay. 
On the banks of the river running at the foot of the hill, on which stands the city, a village is situated equal in extent to the town itself. It consists of about 400 huts or cabins, and, including Indians and slaves, contains a population of nearly 3000 souls. The sole occupation of these villagers consists in fishing off the islands and rocks of Abrolhos, where a species of salmon abounds, which is salted for the market of Bahia. About 50 or 60 small vessels are employed in this fishery, and remain at sea for a month or six weeks till their cargoes are completed. 
Those of the inhabitants not engaged in this fishery are employed in careening and repairing these vessels, and manufacturing the lines and nets. These lines are excellent, being composed of cotton well twisted, and afterwards several times rubbed over with the inner bark of a tree, which contains a glutinous substance that hardens j dd2    ■1

[on the exposure to the sun, and is proof against the action of salt water. These lines are therefore both strongand elastic. 
These fishing vessels are the property of a few individuals, who are comparatively rich. At Bahia they cither receive cash in return for their fish, or else exchange them for different articles of food or clothing, which they retail to such of their more indigent neighbours as can afford to purchase them. 
The food of the inhabitants consists principally of salt fish and the flour of the manioc, which is sold here at about 3s. 6d. per bushel. Scanty, however, as may be their means of enjoyment, they at least live in a temperate climate, where they are exposed to fewer miseries, and experience fewer hardships, than the inhabitants of colder regions. In the latter, a sheltered habitation, warm clothing, and fuel during the rigorous season of winter, are necessary to the comfort of existence ; whereas in a tropical climate these necessaries may with less inconvenience be dispensed with, or a sufficiency of them more easily obtained ; while food is supplied in greater abundance by the bounteous hand of nature, in warmer than in colder countries. Thus, for instance, oranges, bananas, cocoas, and a profusion of other delicious fruits, which are so highly prized in Europe, form part of the sustenance of the poorest inhabitants of these climates. 
Various species of fish, besides that already mentioned, abound on the coast, but the inhabitants are of too indolent a disposition to avail themselves of this advantage, consequently fresh fish is both scarce and bears a high price at Porto-Seguro. Beef, of a very indifferent quality, and of which but a scanty supply is brought to market, is in general sold at three vinthrts — about £d. per pound ; and mutton or pork is almost unknown. No attention is indeed paid in this district to the breeding of hogs or sheep, though the woods afford an inexhaustible store of food for these animals. 
The more opulent part of the inhabitants possess each a countryhouse, with extensive plantations of sugarcane and manioc attached to them. These farms are in general situated on the banks of a river which runs past the city. They are well stored with poultry and domestic cattle, but from the total deficiency in the art of cookery, their tables are not much better supplied here than in the city ; and indeed they may be said, in a greatmeasure, to exist in poverty and want in the midst of abundance.  
The attention paid to literature and science in Rio is extremely small, but here, if we are to rest on the authority of Mr. Lindley, who was unwarrantably detained a considerable time in Porto-Seguro, the inhabitants are buried in a still greater degree of ignorance. 
" Employment of any sort," he observes, " is nearly unknown among the females. In some instances they fabricate a kind of coarse lace for their own use, but even this is by no means universal among them. The needle they are still less acquainted with ; for there are few who can sew the simple chemises (although their chief article of dress), and they have Mulatto slaves for that purpose. Cookery is entirely out of the question, their general diet not requiring nor admitting it ; and so completely ignorant are they of this addition to our comforts, that some flour which I had I could not get converted into bread throughout the town." 
The province naturally abounds in the most delicious fruits for preserves ; but this preparation too is totally neglected by the ladies, even the confections and marmalades of Bahia and Rio de Janeiro being manufactured by male slaves. In short, the people here merely vegetate in a senseless apathy and unnerving indolence, increased by the equal neglect of their minds : for few of the females can read ; and writing is an art which not many of the men acquire. 
The same inanimate existence and constitutional idleness characterise the male sex. They lose whole days in visiting each other, yawning in flimsy conversation, or playing at cards for pence ; while the plantations, &c are carried on by European overseers, some favourite Mulattoes, or confidential slaves. Nor is the climate to be admitted as an excuse for want of exertion : for many weeks are moderate as an European September, and their winter months are generally so. Even during the hot days, there are intervals of cool breezes, besides some hours of every evening and morning, during which the sun's rays have but little force, and the ground is cool, from the excessive dews generally found within the tropics, and particularly here. 
The inhabitants of Porto-Seguro plume themselves on the circumstances of their's being the immediate spot where Brazil was first discovered by Cabral; and they still preserve with great veneration the holy cross that was erected under a spreading tree at the first high mass, with mu-]  wi  

PORTO-SEGURO.  fsic, discharge of ordnance, &c. during which the Indians, they say, flocked in crowds at a sight so novel, and continued in profound silence, absorbed in amazement and curiosity; and that the divine spirit so visibly manifested itself, that the natives, at the moment, were converted to the holy faith. 
The interior of the district abounds with wild cattle and horses, but they never approach the coast. The horses employed by the inhabitants are of the Buenos Ayres breed. They are in general 14 hands high, small boned, but capable of sustaining great fatigue ; they, however, neither possess much beauty of form, nor display much spirit in their motions. 
The sheep here, with a few exceptions, are of a small breed, and resemble those of Europe. There is one variety, however, that has several horns, and another apparently of the hairy African breed. The ewes of Guinea (ovis Guineensis ), might be transported from Angola to Brazil with the greatest advantage. 
The numerous herds of cattle that are found in this and indeed in the interior of all the provinces of Brazil, might, under proper management, afford cheese and butter, not only for home consumption, but also for foreign commerce ; but at present these useful articles are prepared in small quantities, and rather for curiosity than use. The cheese made in the colony is of a very indifferent quality ; and it is a pretty general opinion, that butter cannot be prepared on account of the heat of the climate; though it is well known that in the East Indies, where the weather is much warmer, most excellent butter may always be procured. 
The vast number of oxen killed in Brazil are mostly slanghtered on account of their hides, though it is evident that, besides salting the carcase, other parts of the body might be appropriated to some useful purpose. But without the adoption of a liberal plan of policy, and judicious encouragements being offered for the promotion of agriculture, it will, in all probability, as well as its sister arts, continue to languish in a country possessing every advantage of climate and natural situation. 
The mules reared in and near Porto Seguro are large, well shaped, and extremely handsome. They are lively, and do not display, in their general appearance, the sluggishness common to these animals. 
The wild animals of this district are similar to those of the other provinces of Brazil. The ravenous quadrupeds of the New World, such as  ounces, leopards, tygers, hyenas, &c. display less ferocity, and are far inferior in size and strength to those of the same kind in the African and Asiatic continents. 
The pregusia or sloth is very common in this province, and perfectly harmless. Its head is round, with a very small round mouth, and small blunt teeth ; its nose is black, high and smooth, but the other parts of the body are coveied with ashcoloured hair, and the eyes are small, black and heavy. This animal, which is about the size of a fox, feeds on the succulent leaves of trees, which serve it both for food and drink. Though its limbs appear to be exceedingly weak, it will nevertheless lay hold so firmly of the branches of trees, as not to be easily shaken off. So great an antipathy has the sloth to rain, that on its approach it carefully conceals itself. It cannot proceed above a stone's throw in the course of several minutes, and derives its name from the uncommon slowness of its motion. Monkeys, which are so numerous in other parts of this colony, are here extremely scarce : the few that do frequent the woods in the neighbourhood of Porto Seguro are chiefly of the grey sort. Armadilloes are, however, extremely numerous, and run about in every direction. One species possesses a quality similar to the hedgehog, of rolling itself up into a ball when attacked, and presenting on all sides its scaly covering, which forms an impenetrable shield. The saratue, which is about the size of our fox, is an extremely savage animal, and commits great depredations among the poultry in the vicinity of the city. This animal, when attacked, defends itself with great resolution. 
The woods and groves abound with various birds, some of which display the most brilliant and gaudy plumage, while others delight us by their melodious voices ; but as they do not differ from those in the other provinces, we shall not here enter into a particular description of them. 
The botanical productions are here, as in every part of this country, extremely abundant. They are, however, but little known to the inhabitants, and from the extreme jealousy of the government, learned foreigners have been hitherto prevented from examining them. Many of the trees round Porto Seguro exude gums of a resinous, mucilaginous, and balsamic nature. Among the latter is one similar to the balsam of Peru, which is collected by the inhabitants, and exported in considerable quantities to Europe. It is procured from the female of the pine tribe, and is collected in pans after the tree is cut down. Towards the northern extremity of this captainship, the banks J  PORTO-SEGURO.    [of the Rio Grande are covered with immense forests, which are considered as the best in Brazil for the purposes of shipbuilding. It is from hence that the king's yards are principally supplied with timber. 
The trees chiefly employed for this purpose, are the sippipira, which resembles the teak of India, and the peroba, oraubu, and louro, which are species or varieties of oak and larch. Cedar and other woods, which are used for deck planks, also abound in these forests, as well as brazil and logwood, mahogany, camwood, campeachy, and various other. The Rio Grande is navigable for canoes to a great distance, uninterrupted by any falls or rapids. After ascending the country to a considerable distance westward, it takes a direction to the south, and is supposed to originate beyond the mines of Pitangui, though its source has not hitherto been explored. It is broad and deep at its mouth within the bar, and for a considerable distance above it. An expedition was undertaken a few years ago by the two sons of the civil governor or judge of the province, Sen. Joze Dantes Coelho, accompanied by his servant and the capitian mor, or military captain of Port Seguro, attended by their servants and a party of Indians. During fifteen days they proceeded up the river in canoes, without experiencing the slightest interruption. They found its banks clothed with the most valuable natural productions, the forests abounding with hogs, and the savannahs with cattle. At the termination of their voyage they observed small diamonds scattered over the ground, at a short distance from the river, as Well as several other precious stones. The diamonds did not appear to them of great value ; but they proposed to repeat their excursion, with a view of more accurately investigating this part of the district, when they were prevented, by the interposition of government, from carrying this resolution into effect. 
From the cursory observations which their short stay enabled them to make r it appears evident, that under an enlightened administration, and with proper encouragement, settlements might be formed on the Rio Grande of Porto Seguro, which in a short time would become a great national benefit, though at present, from the most absurd and mistaken policy, the Portuguese government wish it to remain unpeopled and unknown. 
On the coast, to the s. of the Rio Grande, has been lately established the settlement of Belmont, which is at present in a thriving condition :  and, a little farther on, we meet with the town of Santa Cruz, which is about five leagues distant from Porto Seguro. The town, which has never been large, is now rapidly falling into a state of decay : the harbour admits only small vessels, drawing about 12 feet water ; but in the Coroa Vermeil, immediately adjoining, ships of any burden may safely come to anchor. 
To the 5. of Porto Seguro, the small shallow bay of Tranquoso indents the shore. This part of the coast is delightful, and covered with several thriving plantations. At a small distance from Tranquoso, on the banks of the Rio des Fratres, the country is uninhabited ; owing possibly to the risks to which vessels are exposed, on entering this river, from its mouth being choaked up by a very dangerous bar. 
1 o the s. of the Rio Fratres, the country becomes mountainous. Monte Pascoa serves as a landmark to those mariners who navigate this part of the coast, which is extremely dangerous, on account of a continuation of reefs, sunken rocks and shallows, especially to those vessels which approach to the river Carevellos ; though the neighbouring pilots are so extremely skilful, that very few accidents are known to occur. 
From the Rio des Fratres to Villa Prado, the coast is inhabited by numerous hostile tribes of Indians, which renders travelling so extremely dangerous, as to cut off all communication by land between these two places. The latter is a flourishing fishing town. The inhabitants in the vicinity of this village, as well as of Alcoabass, which is situated at a short distance from it, are chiefly occupied with the culture of manioc, and the preparation of the cassava powder, which they carry to the port of Carevellos. 
On account of a dangerous bar, only vessels of small burden can enter this harbour, though within it the water deepens to 10 fathoms. 
The town of Carevellos is situated about six miles above the mouth of the river. It is more populous, and the buildings somewhat superior to those of Porto Seguro. 'The country around is covered with plantations of manioc, Avhence large quantities of this useful article are sent to Rio de Janeiro, Bahia and Pernambuco. Small craft are built at the port of Carevellos, not only for their own use, but in order to supply what is wanted at Porto Seguro. 
San Matthias, which forms the boundary of Porto Seguro in this direction, lies about 10 leagues to the southward of Carevellos. Here likewise we meet with extensive plantations of manioc. The coast of this captainship extends]  

PORTO-SEGURO.  [for the length of 70 leagues, with an unbounded extent of country towards the w. though at present there are no settlements in that direction above 10 or 12 leagues from the sea. Gold and many valuable minerals abound in the interior of this district. 
The extreme jealousy displayed by the Portuguese, respecting the admission of strangers into their colonies, renders our knowledge of the interior of this interesting country still extremely defective. During Mr. Lindley's enforced stay at Porto Seguro,the commission empowered to seize his papers, found in his possession a small quantity of grain gold, intermixed with goldcoloured sand, which had been given to him by one of the colonists, as a sample. This strongly attracted their curiosity, and he was strictly questioned respecting it. This gentleman frankly informed them how it came into his possession, but declared that he was totally ignorant of the person from whom he received it, though he had reason to suppose that he was an inhabitant of a distant settlement ; on which he was ordered to prepare for a journey, in order, if possible, to discover and identify the individual from whom he obtained it. 
In consequence of this determination, he was commanded to be in readiness to accompany the minister, &c. on the following morning, at five o'clock ; and he gives the following interesting account of that part of the district which he was thus enabled to visit. 
" On the second of August," says he, " we mounted our horses, altogether seven of us, and took the beach to the s. After an hour's ride, abruptly turned to the w. into the country, and ascending a steep height, soon arrived at the chapel of Nossa Senhora de Judea, on its summit. The prospect from hence is grand indeed, not only of the surrounding country, but commanding the adjacent ocean, upon which the white walls of the chapel form an excellent seamark ; and its patroness, the virgin, is particularly invoked by the neighbouring coasting vessels and fishing smacks, in cases of distress or contrary winds : her fame even extends to curingseveral disorders, if called on with proper faith. The inside of the building is decorated with rude drawings of vessels in distress, and of sick chambers ; having inscriptions under each, of the different cases which they are intended to commemorate. 
" After eating a biscuit, and drinking some of the good vicar's water, we visited several plantations and ingenios in the neighbourhood, at one  of which we procured an Indian guide. Taking the course of the river, we had a beautiful ride over a fine champaign country, wanting only cultivation to form the best of meadow land ; the soil black mould, at times gravelly, clay patches and sandy flats. 
" Leaving the open land, Ave entered the woods of ages, through a narrow path, which admitted only one horseman abreast, and was impenetrably defended from the sun's rays by the overhanging branches, which sometimes were so low as to be very inconvenient. After two hours smart ride, the country again opened ; and we passed several plantations of sugarcane, mandiock, &c. with pieces of ground partly cleared, and numberless other spots capable of being converted into fine land, either for pasture or tillage. The scene now changed to a range of low hills, lying e. and w. in the direction of the river, to which the land gradually descended ; but on the opposite bank it rose piecipitately to a high cliff, covered with neverfading verdure. Riding parallel to these hills, about one o'clock we arrived at the plantation and ingenio of Jaoa Furtado. Here Ave alighted, expecting better accommodation than Ave might meet with at the Villa Verde, a little further ; which, being an extreme settlement, is inhabited only by the vicar (a missionary), three whites, and a few converted Indians. 
" Our host Avas an old bachelor of 70, who resided with a maiden sister, of nearly the same age. The old man told me he Avas born near the spot ; that his life had been a series of industry ; and the ingenio, building, furniture, &c. Avere almost entirely the work of his oavii hands. I found him very conversant in the natural history of the country around him, particularly in ornithology ; and I Avas sorry our momentary stay enabled me not to obtain more information. ; " The Avord ingenio is the Portuguese distinction of those who have a sugar-Avork, here very simple, consisting of three rollers of ponderous Avood, tAvo feet in diameter, and three in length, working horizontally in a frame : the upper part of the centre roller joins a square beam that ascends through the framework, and to which are affixed cross pieces, sufficiently low for the harness of two horses, that move the whole. The siderollers Avork by cogs from the centre one. Underneath this machine is a long trough, slanted, that receives the juice of the cane as pressed out by the rollers. The juice is then conveyed to a shalloAV boiler, of six feet in diameter, and skimmed from all impurities : after cooling in]   ==[[Porto-Seguro|PORTO-SEGURO]]==,  [another vessel, they add an alkali of wood ashes, suffer it to stand some days, pour off the pure liquor, convey it to the same boiler, and evaporate till the sugar is formed, the settlings, &c. being distilled to a powerful spirit. How widely different is this primitive sugarmaking, from the immense works, machines, and engines, employed by our West India planters ! 
" I found the accommodation of the house far superior to what I had expected, from the general poverty of Porto Seguro, and, in fact, the best I met with in this part of Brazil : our welcome was free, provision well cooked (for the country), and tolerably clean. We dined on the ground, mats being first laid, and a clean cloth spread over them. There was plenty of earthenware (a rarity here), silver spoons, and knives and forks hafted with the same metal. At night, the bedding was decent and comfortable. 
" The next morning I arose with the sun, and was charmed with the country surrounding the plantation. The house itself was encircled with bannanas, cotton shrubs, cocoas, and orange trees : diverging from them, inclosures of canes, mandiock, &c. To the westward lay a large tract of herbage, reserved for grazing, irregularly fenced with native woods. On its descent to the river, the ground, unequal, formed some beautiful hollows, patched with groups of trees, which, with the stream itself, and cattle on its banks, pictured the most delightful scene. 
" As I skirted the woods, I saw birds of the most brilliant plumage, one nearly the size of a turkey. Of these the moutou was particularly rich, of a deep blue, nearly approaching black, with a head and eye strikingly beautiful. Toucans were numerous, and many others elegant indeed. Marmozets, both of the grey and silver lion colour, were in every bush ; but their piercing shriek is disagreeable, and, if near you, penetrates to the very brain. I fancied I heard the distant growl of ounces, which are numerous, and fatal in their ravages, forming, with snakes, the chief scourge of the planters. 
" After dinner we began our return by the same route, passing several scattered plantations, situate near the river, for the better transporting their products to Porto Seguro, &c. The whole land besides (extending both ways to the next seaports) is entirely neglected, although finely watered with small streams in every part, where the cane, cotton, and mandiock, would grow with scarcely any labour, as well as the immense variety of other tropical produce : in short, where nature spontaneously offers her gilts, and invites  the hand of man. But this beautiful country, one of the finest in the world, is entirely lost through want of inhabitants, of cultivation, and of industry; mines of wealth being buried, far exceeding all their mineral or metallic ores. 
" Absorbed in these reflections, I rode along, our party returning very silent, probably chagrined at their want of success in discovering the presumptuous vassal who had dared to touch or think of so prohibited an article as gold ; but though the bird was flown, his rich nest remained. They found out the stream on whose margin the gold had been discovered. Guards were directly appointed over it, and all approach to its banks interdicted, in the dread name of her most faithful majesty; while a further sample was taken for accurate inspection and assay on the arrival of the commission at Bahia." 
On Mr. Lindley's arrival at Porto Seguro, some of the inhabitants, who were officiously prying into every corner of his vessel, observing a medicine chest, immediately concluded that he belonged to the medical profession. This mistake being disseminated through the city and its neighbourhood, he was immediately beset with patients of every description ; some imploring his assistance por amor de Deos, and others entreating him in the name of Nossa Senhora Maria to cure their maladies. 
Many instances are recorded by this writer of the ignorance of the inhabitants in the city and neighbourhood of Porto Seguro, as well as of their extreme filthiness, indelicacy, and indolence. The shocking custom of searching each others heads for vermin, which is only practised by the lowest vulgar in Spain and Portugal, here prevails among all ranks of the community ; nor does the presence of strangers prove any hinderance to this disgusting operation. 
To a certain cutaneous distemper (psora), here termed sarna, which is regarded as an opprobrium by the natives of other countries, no idea of shame or disgrace is attached in Brazil. It is common to hear even ladies complain of it without a blush ; nor, so far as we have been informed, is its cure ever attempted in this country. This disorder often terminates in a scaly leprosy, particularly on the stomachs of the men, who are, provided with openings in the sides of their shirts, for the purpose of scratching, which they do without the least hesitation, whatever company may be present.] 
Porto-Seguro, the capital of the above province, of the same name, on the seacoast, and on the shore of a great port ; thus called by Pedro Al-   w  FOR  varez Cabral, when he discovered and found it secure from tempests. It has, besides the parish church, which is very good, with the dedicatory title of Nuestra Senora de la Pena, the churches of San Sebastian, La Misericordia, Nuestra Senora del Rosario, and an house of entertainment of the Jesuits. It is situate on an eminence, and detended with good fortifications, and a castle well furnished, in which the governor resides. The town is small, but handsome, rich, commercial, and well peopled. Amongst the inhabitants are some noble and distinguished Portuguese families. Its climate is hot, but healthy. It is 92 miles s. of S. Jorge, and 286 n. n. e. of Espirito Santo, in lat. 16° V s. and long. 39° 37' w.

==[[Portquesin|PORTQUESIN]]==, a river of the province and colony of Pennsylvania in N. America. 
==[[Port-Royal|PORT-ROYAL]]==, a city of the island of Jamaica, formerly the capital ; situate on the extremity of a long strip of land, which, running into the sea, forms part of the circumference of a beautiful port, which gives it its name, where 1000 vessels may lie at anchor in complete security. The quay also is such, that vessels of the largest size can come close up, and can lade and unlade with the greatest convenience. Indeed, this was esteemed of such importance by the inhabitants, that they made this the capital of the island, although the soil is dry and sandy, producing nothing, and even in want of fresh water. From the aforesaid advantages, however, it had been the constant rendezvous of pirates, who by their riches had made it a place of great consideration. It contained 2000 houses of beautiful structure, the waterconveyances of which were as costly as those of London, and at the time of its achme there were few cities in the world which could vie with it in commerce, riches, and vicious habits. Thus it remained till 1692, when a terrible earthquake caused it to be overwhelmed by the water. It was again rebuilt, but, after standing 10 years, was burnt to ashes. Notwithstanding this second catastrophe, the advantageous situation of the port was such as to induce its rebuilding for the third time : but, in 1722, a 

VOL. IV.  hurricane, the strongest that ever was known 5 reduced it to a heap of ruins ; when, being as it,were sensible that the wrath of heaven had marked out this devoted city to destruction, an act was passed by the assembly, decreeing the removal of the customhouse and other public buildings ; forbidding any fair to be carried on "here in future. The bay of Kingston was then the great rendezvous of merchants ; for it is very deep, and affords accommodation for careening, and, accordingly, the vessels lie in it in the time of peace ; though, in the time of war with Spain, at the Point of Negrillo, to the n. of the island. At the extremity of the long strip of land is situate Fort Carlos, with 126 cannon, which defend the entrance of the bay.

[==[[Portsmouth|PORTSMOUTH]]==, the metropolis of New Hampshire, and the largest town in the State, and its only seaport, is situate about two miles from the sea, on the 5. side of Piscataqua River. It is the shire town of Rockingham County, and its harbour is one of the finest on the continent, having a sufficient depth of water for vessels of any burden. It is defended against storms by the adjacent land, in such a manner, as that ships may securely ride there in any season of the year ; nor is it ever frozen, by reason of the strength of the current, and narrowness of the channel. Besides, the harbour is so well fortified by nature, that very little art will be necessary to render it impregnable. Its vicinity to the sea renders it very convenient for naval trade. A lighthouse, with a single light, stands on Newcastle Island, at the entrance of the harbour, in lat. 43° 3' n. and long. 70° 41 ay. Ships of war have been built here ; among others, the America, of 74 guns, launched November, 1782, and presented to the King of France, by the Congress of the United States. Portsmouth contains about  dwelling  houses, and nearly as many other buildings, besides those for public use, which are three Congregational churches, one Episcopal church, one for Universalists, a Statehouse, a markethouse, four schoolhouses, a workhouse, and a bank. The exports for one year, ending September 30, 1794, amounted to the value of 153,865 dollars. A settlement was begun here in 1623, by Captain Mason and other merchants, among whom Sir F. Gorges had a share. They designed to carry on the fishery, to make salt, trade with the natives, and prepare lumber. As agriculture was only a secondary object, the settlement failed. The town was incorporated in 1633.

==[[Potosi|POTOSI]]==, a province and government of the kingdom of Peru, in the archbishopric of Charcas. It was formerly a corregimiento, and its jurisdiction was bounded by the curacy of Salinas with the province of Paria, which is to the n. e. the whole of the rest, of its district being surrounded by the province of Porco. It is a mountainous country, full of ravines and chasms, of a very cold temperature, and consequently barren in vegetable productions. It is 10 leagues long, from e. to w. and seven wide. In its territory they breed much sheepcattle, native sheep, and some vicunas. It has many mines of crystalline salt ; and it is irrigated by the river Pilcomayo, into which run many tributary streams. The inhabitants amount to 25,000, and the capital is of the same name. [This province joined the new government of Buenos Ayres in 1810. See La Plata.} 
Potosi, this town was founded in 1545, on the skirts of the mountain which is also thus called, and near a ravine, through which passes a stream which irrigates the town. Its population was formed by the people who had collected for the working of the mine ; [and it amounted in 1802 to 30,000 souls.] It has a mint, which was established in 1562 ; six convents of religious orders, namely, of San Francisco, Santo Domingo, San Augustin, La Merced, and San Juan de Dios and Bethlehemites, which are hospitals ; two monasteries of religious women, the one of Augustines, the other of Carmelites, a college which belonged to the Jesuits, and a house of recluse women. In the town and its district were 19 curacies, the which were reduced, in 1759, to seven, with the names of La Matrix;, which is of Spaniards, and for the Indians those

In its vicinity are some hot medicinal baths, much famed, and called of Don Diego. Fortyfive miles w. s. w. of Chuquisaca, in lat. 19° 47' s. and long. 67° 22' w. 
Potosi, the mountain of which we have spoken in the former article, and on the skirts of which the city stands, is celebrated throughout the world for the immense riches which have been extracted from its inexhaustible silvermines, which were discovered by chance in 1645 by an Indian called Huallpa ; who following a vicuna, or native sheep, over the rough and craggy parts of the mountains, caught hold of a small tree to support himself whilst in the act of falling ; and tearing the same up by the roots, found sticking amongst the earth some small pieces of silver. The first person who examined this mine was Tomas Villaroel, in the same year. The mountain is three miles in circumference, and 6000 Castillian yards high above the level of the sea, as it was measured by Don Luis Godin, of the Academy of the Sciences of Paris. It is of a sharp conical figure, and resemble a great pavilion. In the interior it is nearly hollow from the excavations which have been made for so many years, and on the exterior it appears like an anthill, from the multitude of mouths by which it is entered. The richest mines are called La Descubridora, Del Estano, La Rica, and La Mendieta ; all of which are in the n. part, and have their direction to the s. At the beginning the metal was prepared by fusion, but lately by quicksilver, on account of their not being able to pay the miners, the allay of the silver having decreased, and through the want of hands for the working of the mines, owing to the plague •which was experienced in 1720, when an infinite number of the Mitayos Indians died ; these being of those which every province were obliged to send to work for a limited time, agreeably with the plan established by the viceroy Don Francisco de Toledo. By this misfortune the working of the mines greatly fell off, until the year 1737, when they were again worked with some degree of vigour and enterprise, owing to the king's having lowered the rate of duty from a fifth to a tenth. According to the most accurate calculation, it should appear, that from the aforesaid year of 1545, when the mine was first discovered,  till 1761, no less than 929 millions of dollars were registered, which had paid the duty, and if we should reckon what has been extracted in the contraband way, we may easily judge how much more considerable would be this sum. At present it renders only from four to six marks of silver in each caxon or compartment, all of which is carried down to be worked in skins peculiar to the country. 
[Potosi, San Luis de, an intendancy of the kingdom of Nueva Espana, which (observes Humboldt) comprehends the whole of the n. e. part of the kingdom of New Spain. As it borders either on desert countries, or countries inhabited by wandering and independent Indians, we may say that its n. limits are hardly determined. The mountainous tract called the Bolson de Mapimi includes more than 300 square leagues, from which the Apachis sally out to attack the colonists of Cohahuila and New Biscay. Indented into these two provinces, and bounded on the n. by the Great Rio del Norte, the Bolson de Mapimi is sometimes considered as a country not conquered by the Spaniards, and sometimes as composing a part of the intendancy of Durango. The above traveller traced the limits of Cohahuila and Texas, near the mouth of the Rio Puerco, and towards the sources of the Rio de San Saba, as he found them indicated in the special maps preserved in the archives of the viceroyalty, and drawn up by engineers in the Spanish service. But how was it possible to determine territorial limits in immense savannas, where the farms are from 15 to 20 leagues distant from one another, and where almost no trace of cultivation is any where to be found ? 
The intendancy of San Luis Potosi comprehends parts of a very heterogeneous nature, the different denominations of which have given great room for geographical errors. It is composed of provinces, of which some belong to the Provincias internas, and others to the kingdom of New Spain Proper. Of the former there are two immediately depending on the commandant of the Provincias internas ; the two others are considered as Provincias internas del Vireynato. These complicated and unnatural divisions are explained in the following table : " 
The intendant of San Luis Potosi governs : 
A. In Mexico Proper : 
The Province of San Luis, which extends from the Rio de Panuco to the Rio de Santander, and which comprehends the important]  

POTOSI.  [mines of Charcas, Potosi, Ramos, and Catorce. 
B. In the Provincias internas del Vireynato : 
1. The new kingdom of Leon. 
2. The colony of New Santander. 
C. In the Provincias internas de la Commandanciageneral Oriental. 
1. The province of Cohahuila. 
2. The province of Texas. 
It follows from the latest changes which have taken place in the organization of the commandanciageneral of Chihuahua, that the intendancy of San Luis now includes, besides the province of Potosi, all that tract which goes under the denomination of Provincias internas Orientales. A single intendant is consequently at the head of an administration which includes a greater surface than all European Spain. But this immense country, gifted by nature with the most precious productions, and situated under a serene sky in the temperate zone, towards the borders of the tropic, is, for the greatest part, a wild desert, still more thinly peopled than the governments of Asiatic Russia. Its position on the eastern limits of New Spain, the proximity of the United States, the frequency of communication with the colonists of Louisiana, and a great number of circumstances which we shall not endeavour here to develope, will probably soon favour the progress of civilization and prosperity in these vast and fertile regions. 
The intendancy of San Luis comprehends more than 230 leagues of coast, an extent equal to that from Genoa to Reggio in Calabria. But all this coast is without commerce and without activity, with the exception of a few small vessels, which come from the W. Indies to lay in Provisions, either at the Bar of Tampico, near 'anuco, or at the anchorage of New Santander. That part which extends from the mouth of the Great Rio del Norte to the Rio Sabina is almost still unknown, and has never been examined by navigators. Itwouldbe of great importance, however, to discover a good port in this northern extremity of the Gulf of Mexico. Unfortunately, the e. coast of New Spain offers every where the same obstacles, a want of depth for vessels drawing more than 38 decimeters, or 12 feet 5^ inches of water, bars at the mouths of the rivers, necks of land, and long islots, of which the direction is parallel to that of the continent, and which prevent all access to the interior basin. The shore of the provinces of Santander and Texas, from lat. 21° to 29°, is singularly festooned, and  presents a succession of inferior basins, from four to five leagues in breadth, and 40 to 50 in length. They go by the name of lagunas, or saltwater lakes. Some of them (the Laguna de Tamiagua, for example) are completely shut in. Others, as the Laguna Madre, and the Laguna de San Bernardo, communicate by several channels with the ocean. The latter are of great advantage for a coasting trade, as coasting vessels are there secure from the great swells of the ocean. It would be interesting for geology, to examine on the spot if these lagunas have been formed by currents penetrating far into the country by irruptions, or if these long and narrow islots, ranged parallel to the coast, are bars which have gradually risen above the mean level of the waters. 
Of the whole intendancy of San Luis Potosi, only that part which adjoins the province of Zacatecas, in which are the rich mines of Charcas, Guadalcazar, and Catorce, is a cold and moun* tainous country. The bishopric of Monterey, which bears the pompous title of New Kingdom of Leon, Cohahuila, Santander, and Texas, are very low regions ; and there is very little undulation of surface in them. This soil is covered with secondary and alluvial formations. They possess an unequal climate, extremely hot in summer, and equally cold in winter, when the north winds drive before them columns of cold air from Canada towards the torrid zone. 
Since the cession of Louisiana to the United States, the bounds between the province of Texas and the county of Natchitoches (a county which is an integral part of the confederation of American republics), have become the subject of a political discussion, equally tedious and unprofitable. Several members of the Congress of Washington were of opinion, that the territory of Louisiana might be extended to the left bank of the Rio bravo del Norte. According to them, " all the country called by the Mexicans the province of Texas anciently belonged to Louisiana. Now the United States ought to possess this last province in the whole extent of rights in which it was possessed by France before its cession to Spain ; and neither the new denominations introduced by the viceroys of Mexico, nor the progress of population from Texas towards the e. can derogate from the lawful titles of the Congress." During these debates, the American government did not fail frequently to adduce the establishment that M. de Lasale, a Frenchman, formed about the year 1685 near the Bay of St. Bernard, without having]

[appeared to encroach on the rights of the crown of Spain. 
But on examining carefully the general map of Mexico and the adjacent countries on the e. we shall see that there is still a great way from the Bay of St. Bernard to the mouth of the Rio del Norte. Hence the Mexicans very justly allege in their favour, that the Spanish population of Texas is of a very old date, and that it was brought, in the very early periods of the conquest, by Linares, Revilla, and Camargo, from the interior of New Spain ; and that M. de Lasale, on disembarking to the w. of the Mississippi, found Spaniards at that time among the savages whom he endeavoured to combat. At present, the intendant of San Luis Potosi considers the Rio Mermentas, or Mexicana, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico to the e. of the Rio de Sabina, as the e. limit of the province of Texas, and consequently of his whole intendancy. 
It may be useful to observe here, that this dispute as to the true boundaries of New Spain can only become of importance when the country, brought into cultivation by the colonists of Louisiana, shall come in contact with the territory inhabited by Mexican colonists ; when a village of the province of Texas shall be constructed near a village of the county of the Opeloussas. Fort Clayborne, situated near the old Spanish mission of the Adayes (Adaes or Adaisses) on the Red River, is the settlement of Louisiana which approaches nearest to the military posts (presidios) of the province of Texas ; and yet there are nearly 68 leagues from the presidio of Nacogdoch to Fort Clayborne. Vast steppes, covered with gramma, serve for common boundaries between the American confederation and the Mexican territory. All the country to the w. of the Mississippi, from the Ox River to the Rio Colorado of Texas, is uninhabited. These steppes, partly marshy, present obstacles very easily overcome. We may consider them as an arm of the sea which separates adjoining coasts, but which the industry of new colonists will soon penetrate. In the United States the population of the Atlantic provinces flowed first towards the Ohio and the Tenessee, and then towards Louisiana. A part of this fluctuating population will soon move farther to the westward. The very name of Mexican territory will suggest the idea of proximity of mines ;', and on the banks of the Rio Mermentas the American colonist will already in imagination possess a soil abounding in metallic wealth. This error, diffused among the lower people, will give rise to new emigrations ;  and they will only learn very late that the famous mines of Catorce, which are the nearest to Louisiana, are still more than 300 leagues distant from it. 
The road from New Orleans to the capital of New Spain which has been opened by the inhabitants of Louisiana, coming to purchase horses in the Provincias internas, is more than 540 leagues in length, and is consequently equal to the distance from Madrid to Warsaw. This road is said to be very difficult from the want of water and habitations ; but it presents by no means the same natural difficulties as must be overcome in the tracks along the ridge of the cordilleras from Santa Fe in New Grenada to Quito, or from Quito to Cusco. It was by this road of Texas that an intrepid traveller, M. Pages, captain in the French navy, went in 1767 from Louisiana to Acapulco. The details which he furnishes relative to the intendancy of San Luis Potosi, and the road from Queretaro to Acapulco, which Humboldt travelled thirty years afterwards, display great precision of mind and love of truth ; but, unfortunately, Mr. Pages is so incorrect in the orthography of Mexican and Spanish names that we can with difficulty find out from his descriptions the places through which he passed. The road from Louisiana to Mexico presents very few obstacles until the Rio del Norte, and we only begin from the Saltillo to ascend towards the table land of Anahuac. The declivity of the cordillera is by no means rapid there ; and we can have no doubt, considering the progress of civilization in the new continent, that land communication will be become gradually very frequent between the United States and New Spain. Public coaches will one day roll on from Philadelphia and Washington to Mexico and Acapulco. 
The three counties of the state of Louisiana, or New Orleans, which approach nearest to the desert country, considered as the e. limit of the province of Texas, are, reckoning from s. to n. the counties of the Attacappas, of the Opeloussas, and of the Natchitoches. The latest settlements of Louisiana are on a meridian which is 25 leagues e. from the mouth of the Rio Mermentas. The most n. town is Fort Clayborne of Nachitoches, seven leagues e. from the old situation of the mission of the Adayes. To the n. e. of Clayborne is the Spanish Lake, in the midst of which there is a great rock covered with stalactites. Following this lake to the s. s. e. we meet in the extremities of this fine country, brought into cultivation by colonists of French origin, first, with the small village of St. Landry,]   O S I.  {three leagues to the n. of the sources of the Rio Mermen tas ; then the plantation of S. Martin ; and, lastly, New Iberia, on the river Teche, near the canal of Bontet, which leads to the Lake of Tase. As there is no Mexican settlement beyond the e. bank of the Rio Sabina, it follows that the uninhabited country which separates the villages of Louisiana from the missions of Texas, amounts to more than 1500 square leagues. The most s. part of these savannas, between the Bay of Carcusin and the Bay of La Sabina, presents nothing but impassable marshes. The road from Louisiana to Mexico goes therefore further to the n. and follows the parallel of the 32d degree. From Natchez travellers strike to the n. of the Lake Cataouillou, by Fort Clayborne of Natchitoches ; and from thence they pass by the old situation of the Aadayes to Chichi, and the fountain of Father Gama. An able engineer, M. Lafond, whose map throws much light on these countries, observes, that eight leagues n. from the post of Chichi there are hills abounding in coal, from which a subterraneous noise is heard at a distance like the discharge of artillery. Does this curious phenomenon announce a disengagement of hydrogen produced by a bed of coal in a state of inflammation ? From the Adayes the road of Mexico goes by San Antonio de Bejar, Loredo (on the banks of the Rio Grande del Norte), Saltillo, Charcas, San Luis Potosi, and Queretaro, to the capital of New Spain. Two months and a half are required to travel over this vast extent of country, in which, from the left bank of the Rio Grande del Norte to Natchitoches, we continually sleep sub dio. 
The most remarkable places of the intendancy of San Luis are : the town of this name, Nuevo Santander, Charcas, Catorce, Monterey, Linares, Monclova, San Antonio de Bejar. 
The population of this intendancy, in 1803, amounted to 334,900 souls ; the extent of surface in square leagues was 27,821 ; the number of inhabitants to the square league being 
Potosi, San Luis de, a city and capital of the alcaldia mayor of the province and bishopric of Mechoacan in Nueva Espana ; situate in a level territory. 
It is of a mild temperature and of modern structure. The streets are wide, proportioned, and straight. It has six magnificent temples ; which are, the parish church, the convents of San Francisco, San Augustin, La Merced, San Juan  de Dios, the college which belonged to the Jesuits, and an hospital of the barefooted Carmelites, a late foundation. Its population consists of 16,000 families of Spaniards, Mustees, Mulattoes, and Indians. Its commerce is of the gold and silver extracted from the mountain of San Pedro de Potosi, which is five leagues distant from the city. Hither were brought the metals to be worked ; although this business has greatly fallen off from the bad allay of the silver, and from the want of means in the miners to meet the expenses of the labour. Indeed, although the mines are very numerous, and none of them filled with water, there is no one will venture to risk his fortune in the undertaking ; and save certain portions of gold and silver extracted from the mine of San Antonio, the inhabitants content themselves with the trade of small necessary articles, and by the slaughter of goats, deriving great emolument from the tallow and the skins which they tan in the yards of the wards of the city ; from all of which may be determined the reason of the great decay of the former resources and opulence of this city.

[==[[Princeton|PRINCETON]]==, a township of Massachusetts, in Worcester County, 15 miles n. by w. of Worcester, and 44 w. by n. of Boston. The township contains 19,000 acres of elevated hilly, but strong and rich, land, adapted to grass and grain. Excellent beef, butter, and cheese, are its principal productions. The mansionhouse and farm of his honour Lieutenantgovernor Gill, one of the most elegant situations and finest farms in the commonwealth, is in this town, and adds much to its ornament and wealth. A handsome Congregational church has lately been erected on a high hill, and commands a most extensive and rich prospect of the surrounding country. Wachusett Mountain, the most noted in the state, is in the n. part of the township. Here, as in many other towns, is a valuable social library. Princeton was incorporated in 1759, and contains 1016 inhabitant.] [Princeton, a posttown of New Jersey ; situate partly in Middlesex, and partly in Somerset counties. Nassau Hall College, an institution which has produced a great number of eminent scholars, is very pleasantly situate in the compact part of this town. Here are about 80 dwellinghouses, and a brick Presbyterian church. 
The college edifice is a handsome stone building, of 180 feet by 54, four stories high, and stands on an elevated and healthful spot, and commands an extensive and delightful prospect. The establishment, in 1796, consisted of a president, who is also professor of moral philosophy, theology, natural and revealed ; history, and elo-  
P R i quence ; a professor of mathematics, natural philosophy, and astronomy ; a professor of chymistry, which subject is treated in reference to agriculture and manufactures, as well as medicine : besides these, two tutors have the instruction of the two lowest classes. The choice of the classical books, and the arrangement of the several branches of education, of the lectures, and of other literary exercises, are such, as to give the students the best opportunity for improvement, in the whole encyclopedia of science. The number of students is from 70 to 90, besides the grammar school. The annual income of the college at present, by the fees of the students, and otherwise, is about £ 1000 currency a year. It has, besides, funds in possession, through the extraordinary liberality of Mr. James Leslie of New York, and Mrs. Esther Richards of Railway, to the amount of 10,000 dollars, for the education of poor and pious youth for the ministry of the gospel ; and the reversion of an estate in Philadelphia for the same purpose, of between £200 and £300 per annum, a legacy of the late Mr. Hugh Hodge, a man of eminent piety, which is to come to the college at the death of a very worthy and aged widow. 
The college library was almost wholly destroyed during the late war ; but out of the remains of that, and by the liberal donations of several gentlemen, chiefly in Scotland, it has collected one of about 2300 volumes. There are besides this, in the college, two libraries belonging to the two literary societies, into which the students have arranged themselves, of about 1000 volumes ; and the library of the president, consisting of 1000 volumes more, is always open to the students. Before the war this college was furnished with a philosophical apparatus, worth £500, which (except the elegant orrery constructed by Mr. Rittenhouse) was almost entirely destroyed by the British army in thelate war.

==[[Providence|PROVIDENCE]]==, an island of the N. Sea, one of the Lucayas or Bahamas, and the second after that of Lucayoneca, to the s. of which it lies. It was discovered by Christopher Columbus in his first voyage, in 1494 ; is 25 miles long, and nine wide, and is the residence of the governor of these islands, his abode being in the city of Nassau. The Indians called it Abacoa ; but Mr. Saile, who was twice thrown upon it by stress of weather, changed its name to Providence. It is in the midst of some hundred others, the greater part of which are nothing more than shoals or rocks rising above the surface of the water. This island was at first an asylum for the pirates, who for a long time infested the navigation of those seas ; the which obliged the court of England to appoint a governor and establish a company of commerce for this island, about the middle of the sixteenth century. Its principal branch of trade consists in oranges, with which  2-21  it abounds, and in victuals and provisions for ships, which are frequently wrecked upon its coast, and which, sailing for the continent of America, are forced to touch here for fresh supplies. The provisions are brought hither from Carolina ; and for this purpose it has magazines or storehouses ; since the island of itself produces hardly any thing but oranges, salt, a little brazilwood, maize, and pease, the latter being gathered three months after their sowing, and the former six weeks. The coast abounds in fish of various and exquisite kinds; and in some parts there are many trees and plants. 
The principal port is very dangerous, from a bar which it has at its entrance, and where there is only 16 feet water. The whole coast is indubitably much exposed, and dangerous for vessels, not only from the violence and various direction of the currents, which are such as to confound the most expert pilots, but from the roughness of the sea, and the frequent and terrible tempests of thunder, lightning, and rain, when the whole world seems coming to an end. The multitude of rocks and shoals which surround this island are, some of them, covered with water, others standing out of, and others on a level with it, all of them presenting so many obstacles to vessels desiring to approach the island ; and this therefore is only attempted in cases of great necessity. The Spaniards have, on three occasions, driven out the English from this island : the first time in 1670, eight years after its establishment ; the second time in 1703, and the last in 1781. 
[NewProvidence, soon after it came into the possession of the British government, was made the seat of government in the colony of the Bahamas. This island is situated in lat. 25° 3' n. and between long. 77° 10' and 77° 38" w. It is about 25 miles long and nine miles broad, narrowing towards the e. and w. extremities of the island. It has a good harbour, formed by Hog Island on the n. and by the main land of New Providence on the s. There is an entrance at each end of the harbour. Ships drawing 13 or 14 feet water may go over the bar at the w. entrance. That at the other end can only admit vessels of a shallow draught of water. A small lighthouse was erected in 1804, upon Fort Fincastle (which is situate on an eminence overlooking the town of Nassau), and there is a port of entry at Nassau, with a regular customhouse, which may be clearly discerned from vessels four or five leagues to the n. of New Providence. 
The Island of New Providence diners little in its appearance, soil, productions, &c. from the  PRO  [rest of the Bahamas. In general, the surface of this island is rocky and barren, but along the n. side there are fertile and well cultivated spots. The town of Nassau is situate along the 5. side of the harbour, and is perhaps one of the best laid out, and most picturesque situations, to be met w r ith in the W. Indies. The houses are in general remarkably good, and the streets wide and airy. There are two parish churches, and an old fort near the w. entrance of the harbour. The governmenthouse (built in 1804) is one of the best in the W. Indies, and is finely situate on a hill that commands the town and harbour. The public buildings, courts of justice, &c. are likewise handsome and commodious. The barracks are situate in Fort Charlotte, a little to the Wt of Nassau, and were erected at a great expense by the late Earl of Dunmore, when gover-  nor of the Bahamas. There is a very good road, extending for a consideiable way along the n. coast of New Providence, and there is likewise one across the island from Nassau to the s. Besides the trade with the mother country, a very considerable one has been, of late years, carried on between the Bahama Islands and the United States of America, particularly in the articles of salt, live stock, and provisions; which latter have been chiefly obtained from the more southern of those States. A very considerable intercourse has likewise occasionally taken place between New Providence and the Island of Cuba; particularly to the Havannah, where there was a very considerable market for British manufactures, prize goods, &c. through the facilities rendered by the license trade.

Previous to May 1803, there had been granted in this island, by the crown, no less than 23,079 acres of patented estates, for the purpose of cultivation. In 1801 the population amounted to 1599 whites, 752 free people of colour, and 3861 slaves, making a total of 6212; and, in 1803, to 1758 whites, 817 people of colour, and 2515 slaves, the total being 5090.

[Providence, a county of Rhode Island State, bounded by Massachusetts n. and e. Connecticut w. and Kent County on the s. It contains nine townships, and 24,391 inhabitants, including 82 slaves. Its chief town is Providence, and the town of Scituate is famous for its excellent cannon foundery. This establishment or plantation be-  longing to the Governor of Rhode Island, was founded by Roger Williams, curate of a church of Brownists, in the Bay of Massachusetts, but which was by the justice put down, from the new opinions and doctrines he was broaching. He was followed by a considerable number of people, and he established them here without the knowledge of the government, giving to his new settlement the name of Providence. Here he lived 40 years, with such prudence and able conduct, as to regain the favour of his compatriots, and was recommended to the government of Massachusetts by some Englishmen of the first nobility. He wrote a tieatise upon the doctrine of the Quakers, applied himself with particular zeal  mm  to the conversion of the Indians, and made a very useful regulation for the government of Rhode Island. This plantation occupies a district of 20 square miles, and is separate from Connecticut on the w. by an imaginary line drawn from n. to s. and from Massachusetts by another line from e. to w. See article Rhode Island.] 
[Providence, the chief town of the above county, situate 22 miles n. by w. f w. from Newport, and 24 from the sea ; seated at the head of navigation of Narraganset Bay, on both sides of Providence River, the two parts of the town being connected by a bridge, 160 feet long and 22 wide. It is the oldest town in the State, having been settled by Roger Williams and his company in 1636 ; and lies in lat. 41° 46' n. and long 71° 23' w. 37 miles s. by w. of Boston, and 206 n. e. of Philadelphia. Ships of almost any size sail up and down the channel, which is marked out by stakes, erected at points of shoals and beds lying in the river, so that a stranger may come up to the town without a pilot. A ship of 950 tons, for the E. India trade, was lately built in this town, and fitted for sea. In 1764, there were belonging to the county of Providence 54 sail of vessels, containing 4320 tons. In 1790, there were 129 vessels, containing 11,942 tons. This town suffered much by the Indian war of 1675, when a number of its inhabitants removed to Rhode Island for shelter. In the late war, the case was reversed ; many of the inhabitants of that island removed to Providence. The public buildings are, an elegant meetinghouse for Baptists, 80 feet square, with a lofty and beautiful steeple, and a large bell, cast at the Hope Furnace in Scituate; a meetinghouse for Friends and Quakers ; three for Congregationalists, one of which, lately erected, is the most elegant perhaps in the United States ; an Episcopal church ; a handsome courthouse, 70 feet by 40, in which is deposited a library for the use of the inhabitants of the town and country ; a workhouse ; a markethouse, 80 feet long and 40 wide ; and a brick schoolhouse, in which four schools are kept. Rhode Island college is established at Providence. The elegant building erected for its accommodation, is situate on a hill to the e. of the town; and while its elevated situation renders it delightful, by commanding an extensive variegated prospect, it furnishes it with a pure, salubrious air. The edifice is of brick, four stories high, 150 feet long and 46 wide, with a projection of 10 feet each side. It has 48 rooms for students, and eight larger ones for  

PRO  public uses. The roof is slated. It is a flourishing seminary, and contains upwards of 60 students. It has a library, containing between two and 3000 volumes, and a valuable philosophical apparatus. The houses in this town are generally built of wood, though there are some brick buildings which are large and elegant. At a convenient distance from the town, an hospital for the smallpox and other diseases has been erected. There are two spermaceti works, a number of distilleries, sugarhouses, and other manufactories. Several forts were erected in and near the town during the war, which, however, are not kept in repair. It has an extensive trade with Massachusetts, Connecticut, and part of Vermont; with the W. Indies, with Europe, and lately with the E. Indies and China. A bank has also been established here, and a cotton manufactory, which employs 100 hands ; with which is connected a mill for spinning cotton, on the model of Sir R. Arkwright's mill. It is erected at Pawtucket Falls, in N. Providence, and is the first of the kind built in America. The exports for one year, ending September 30, 1794, amounted to the value of 643,373 dollars. It contains 6380 inhabitants, including 48 slaves.]

Its w. extremity, called the Island of Santa Catalina, is separated from the rest of the island by a narrow channel, over which was thrown a bridge by the said pirates.  P U A    
•  
Notwithstanding it be small, it should be considered as one of the best of the W. India islands, as well from its fertility as from the salubrity of its climate ; to which may be added the facility of its fortification and defence of its coasts, the abundance of its fine water, and the circumstance of there being in it no serpent or venomous insect.

[Province Town is situate on the hook of Cape Cod, in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, three miles n. w. of Race Point. ItsTiarbour, which is one of the best in the State, opens to the s. and has depth of water for any ships. This was the first port entered by the English when they came to settle in New England, in 1620. It has been in a thriving and decaying state many times. It is now rising, and contains 454 inhabitants ; whose sole dependence is upon the codfishery, in which they employ 20 sail, great and small. Ten of their vessels, in 1790, took 11,000  quintals of codfish. They are so expert and successful, that they have not lost a vessel or a man in the business, since the war. The houses, in number about 90, stand on the inner side of the cape, fronting the s. e. They are one story high, and set upon piles, that the driving sands may pass under them ; otherwise they would be buried in sand. They raise nothing from their lands, but are wholly dependent on Boston, and the towns in the vicinity, for every vegetable production. There are but two horses and two yokes of oxen kept in the town. They have about 50 cows, which feed in the spring upon beach grass, which grows at intervals upon the shore ; and in summer they feed in the sunken ponds and marshy places that are found between the sandhills. Here the cows are seen wading, and even swimming, plunging their heads into the water up to their horns, picking a scanty subsistence from the roots and herbs produced in the water. They are fed in the winter on sedge, cut from the flats.]

==[[Pucarani|PUCARANI]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Omasuyos in Peru. In the time of the Indians it was called Quescamarca, which signifies the place of stones, from the abundance of these found in its mountains. Also, the Spaniards, when they peopled it in the time of the Viceroy Don Francisco de Toledo, called it Pucarani, to please the Indians, and in memory of a fortress which they had four leagues from thence, to defend themselves from the Pacajes Indians. It is w. of Tiaguanaco, and three leagues from the great lake Titicaca, from whence the inhabitants supply themselves with plenty of fish. These Gentiles adored a mountain, which rises •conspicuous amidst the others of the corderilla, and which is the one nearest to the settlement called Cacaaca, and always covered with snow. In this mountain the Indians have a figure of an Indian in stone, of half a yard high, and to this they sacrifice, by way of propitiation, human creatures, whenever they think the deity is angry, and at other times sheep, rabbits, and other animals. After the conquest of the kingdom, there entered to preach here the fathers Juan Caldera de Roxas and Pedro Sanchez Bernal, most pious clergy, and zealous in the cause of religion. In 1576, the religious of St. Augustin left this curacy for that of Viacha, which is very near ; and the first Curate of which was Fr. Juan del Canto. It has been rendered celebrated from the devout sanctuary of the miraculous image of Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria, with the dedicatory title of Gracia, and commonly called Pucarani : this image was brought here in 1589, by the fathers Nicolas Ximenez and Geronimo Gamarra, and was made from a model of the image of Copacavana, by Don Francisco Tito Yupanqui, an Indian of the blood royal. This image has performed such repeated miracles, as to have acquired an extraordinary devotion in all these provinces, as is manifested by the concourse of people, of all nations, coming to implore relief in their necessities. This settlement is nine leagues from La Paz, and at a small distance from the Valley of yoL. iv.  Guarina, in which was fought the battle of this name, between Gonzalo Pizarro and Diego Centeno, who commanded the royal army : in lat. 17° \2's.

==[[Puchacay|PUCHACAY]]==, a province and corregimiento of the kingdom of Chile ; bounded on the n. by the province of Itata, on the «. by Huilquilemu, on the s. by the river Biobio, and on the w. by the sea. From n. to s. it is 12 leagues in extent, and 23 from e. to w. It is irrigated by the river Andalien and several other small streams. jjThis province produces gold dust in abundance, and also great quantities of strawberries, both wild and cultivated, which are the largest in Chile. Gualqui, or St. John the Baptist, founded, in the year 1754, upon the n. shore of the river Biobio, is properly the capital, and the residence of the prefect, or corregidor. This province comprehends the prefecturate of Concepcion, which extends a little beyond the city of that name. Of this we shall say a few words, in addition to what we have already stated, under its proper article. It is well known that it was founded by Pedro di Valdivia, in a dell or valley, formed on the seacoast by some beautiful hills, in lat. 36° 47', and long. 73° 9 7 . This city is the second in the kingdom. At its commencement it flourished greatly, from the vast quantities of gold that were dug in its vicinity ; but after the unfortunate battle of Monigueno, in the year 1554, it was abandoned by Viilagran, the governor, and the inhabitants, on the approach of Lautaro, the Araucanian general, and by him taken and burned. It was, however, rebuilt in the month of November of the following year, after a period of six months ; but Lautaro returning again, rendered himself master of it, slew in the assault the greater part of the garrison, and razed it to its foundations. Don Garcia de Mendoza, after his victories over Caupolican, restored it anew, and fortified it strongly. Having successfully resisted the attempt of the Araucanians to take it, who besieged it for fifty days, it continued to flourish in great splendour until the year 1603, when, with the other s. cities of the Spaniards, it was taken and burned by the Toqui Poillamachu. It soon, 
G G  
W^**  PUC  [however, began to rise again from its ashes, and resume its former lustre, in consequence of the great commerce which was carried on there; and becoming more strong and populous than ever, the Araucanians ceased to molest it. But in the year 1730 a calamity of a new kind assailed it. It was almost totally destroyed by an earthquake, attended by an inundation of the sea, which overflowed the greater part, and swept away every thing that it met in its course. Notwithstanding these repeated misfortunes, the inhabitants obstinately resolved to persevere, and built it anew in a handsome manner; but did not enjoy it long, for in the month of May of the year 1751, this devoted city was again destroyed by an earthquake and an influx of the sea, which entirely covered it. They fortunately escaped, and took refuge on the neighbouring hills ; but continued for 13 years in an unsettled state, not being able to agree among themselves in rebuilding the city. At length they resolved to abandon its former site, and founded a new city, at the distance of a league from the sea, in a beautiful plain called Mocha, upon the n. shore of the Biobio. 
The prefect, or corregidor, is at the same time, by the royal decree, commander of the army, this being the principal place for the rendezvous of the militia of the country. It has for many years been the residence of the campmastergeneral, and of late that of the serjeantmajor. The royal treasury in this place, from whence the soldiers of the frontiers, as well as those belonging to the city, are paid, is confided to the care of a treasurer, a cashier, and an inspector. The audienza, or royal council, was first established in Concepcion in the year 1507 ; but was afterwards abolished, and reestablished some years after in the capital of St. Jago. The president is, however, obliged to reside in this city for six months, and has a palace in it built at the expense of the government. After the destruction of the city of Imperial, in the year 1603, it was erected into a bishopric. 
Besides containing convents of all the religious orders established in Chile, it has one of the Sisters of the Trinity, a college which belonged to the Jesuits, with public schools, in which were taught the sciences of humanity, philosophy, and theology ; a college of nobility, which was likewise under the direction of the Jesuits, and a Tridentine seminary. The inhabitants, in consequence of so many misfortunes, scarcely amount, at present, to 13,000. 
The temperature of the air is at all seasons Very mild; the soil fertile, and the seacoast  abounds with every kind of fish of the most delicious kinds, both scaled and testaceous. The harbour, or bay, is spacious, extending full 3\ leagues from n. to s. and as many from e. to w. 
The Quiriguina, a beautiful and fertile island, situated at its mouth, forms two entrances to it, the e. of which, called Boca Grande, is two miles wide, and the w. called Boca Chica, is but a little more than a mile. The harbour affords good and safe anchorage for vessels of any burden, especially in a port called Talcaguano, where ships at present lie, as the new city is not far distant.]

This city has been celebrated for its quantity of gold and riches which it formerly possessed ; but, at present, it is so reduced and poor, as scarcely to count 60 housekeepers. It is of a very hot and unhealthy temperature, and yields the same vegetable productions as the other settlements of this province, and particularly wild cacas, which abounds greatly. Notwithstanding the country be so sickly as we have just mentioned, we should remark that Doctor Pineros lived curate here for 90 years, dying in 1741. It is eight leagues from the city of S. Martin, and 30 from the capital of the kingdom •of Santa F«.

Puerto-Real, one of the three entrances of the lake of Terminos, in the province and alcaldia mayor of Tabasco in Nueva Espana ; formed by the islands of Tris. 

==[[Puerto-Rico|PUERTO-RICO]]==, an island of the N. Sea, one of the Lesser Antilles, discovered by the admiral Don Christopher Columbus, in his second voyage in 1509. It was conquered by the adelantado Juan Ponce de Leon, native of Seville, after many conflicts and fatigues ; since its natives were very valorous, and defended their liberty at the dearest rate, the greater part of them dying with the weapons in their hands. It was then extremely well peopled with Indians ; and some authors exaggerate the number of inhabitants to 600,000. [Be this as it may, it is certain that in 1778 it contained only 80,660 inhabitants, of which, only 6530 were slaves. There were then reckoned upon the island 77,384 head of horned cattle, 23,195 horses, 1515 mules, 49,058 head of small cattle, 5861 plantations, yielding 2737 quintals of sugar ; 1163 quintals of cotton, 19,556 quintals of rice, 15,216 quintals of maize, 7458 quintals of tobacco, and 9860 quintals of molasses. It is 94 miles long, and 35 wide.] The rains, which cause it to be unhealthy, last during the months of July and August ; but without them the heat would be insufferable. In the midsummer, or time of gathering the harvests, the hurricanes are very frequent ; and that experienced in 1742, was so strong as to render the land for a long time barren. In the former sea-  

PUERTO-RICO.  son great mischief is done to the plants and fruits by the n. e. wind. From eight in the morning till four in the evening the briza prevails ; but from six to eight in the morning, and from four to six in the evening, the heat is very intense. 
The territory, which is beautified from the variety of woods, hills, valleys, and meadows, is extremely fertile, and abundant in wild cattle, the same having been first brought hither by the Spaniards. Through the middle of the island passes, from e. to w. a chain or cordillera of mountains, from which descend many rivers and streams which water the llanuras, causing them to be covered with fine pastures. The hills and skirts of the mountains are covered with trees fit for shipbuilding and other useful purposes ; but the principal productions, and which form the commerce of this island, are sugar, ginger, cotton, flax, coffee, cassia, incense, and hides, of which are embarked annually 2000 for Europe ; also mules, which are much esteemed in the islands of St. Domingo, Jamaica, and Santa Cruz. It also abounds in cancifistola, rice, maize, plantains, pines, oranges, citrons, lemons, calabashes, potatoes, melons, and many other productions, not to omit fine salt. Notwithstanding all these advantages the chief use made of it by the Spaniards was as a place for their ships to touch at and take in necessaries on their passage to the kingdoms of Tierra Firme and Nueva Espana, and this from its favourable situation and goodness of its port. It was thus also that there was established here the office of the maritime post, and that it was the place where the letters for the aforesaid kingdoms, and for that of Granada, are put up together. This island has few towns ; but the inhabitants of them should amount to 10,000. 
[According to Humboldt the dollars imported into Puerto-Rico and Cuba in 1803, amounted to 11,000,000; and the exports consisted of produce to the value of 9,000,000 dollars. Puerto-Rico requires annual remittances from Mexico. The population of Cuba in 1804 is stated, by the same author, at 432,000 souls ; and Le Dru makes that of Puerto-Rico, in 1794, 136,000.] 
Puerto-Rico, the capital, is the city of the same name, with the dedicatory title of San Juan ; situate in a small island on the n. side of the island of Puerto-Rico, and united by means of a causeway. The port is very large and convenient, and in it vessels, however large, may lie perfectly safe. This city was founded by Juan Ponce de Leon, in 1510. It is of an hot temperature, but abounding in vegetable productions,  and is much frequented by vessels. It has been the focus of a contraband trade carried on by the English, French, and Dutch, with the Spaniards, in spite of all the laws and provisions made to the contrary. 
It has convents of the religious of San Francisco, and St. Domingo, a monastery of nuns, and two hospitals ; the one with the name of La Concepcion, for the sick of the inhabitants ; and another called San Nicholas, for the troops of the garrison ; also an hermitage, dedicated to Santa Ana. 
In the s. w. part of the city is the fort and citadel, called San Antonio, which at the same time defends and commands the city ; and at the entrance of the fort is another strong large castle. It is the head of a bishopric, suffragan to the archbishopric of St. Domingo, erected in 1511. The Sefior Don Charles III. whom God preserve, made it in 1766 a royal garrison, as a perpetual banishment to criminals, who employ themselves in the labours of the great works and fortifications which are making to render it impregnable. Its population is composed of from 400 to 500 Spaniards, exclusive of the people of colour and the prisoners, who form an immense number. 
This city has been invaded several times. The first by Francis Drake, who burnt all the vessels that were in the port ; but who, not being able to keep it without abandoning his schemes for the plundering of other ports of America, did not attempt to take the place of arms. The second attempt was in 1598, and also by the English, under the Duke of Cumberland, who made himself master of the whole island, and had thoughts of retaining it, as was afterwards the case with the island of Jamaica ; but having lost 400 men in the space of a month by an epidemic disorder, he abandoned it, carrying away 70 pieces of cannon and great wealth. The third attempt was by the Dutch, who sent hither a strong squadron in 1615, which took and sacked the city, but could not reduce the castle ; and it was attacked a fourth time in 1742, by the English, but without their being able to obtain any advantage whatever. 
It is the native place of Miguel Henriquez, a celebrated Mulatto shoemaker, whose honourable conduct and distinguished services done to the crown, and in which he spent the greater part of his fortune, caused great distinctions to be conferred upon him, and the permission to use the title of Don before his name, also that of Captain, with the use of a gold medal with the  rs-

[==[[Puerto|PUERTO]]==, Santo, an island on the coast of Peru, a league w. n. w. of the port and city of Santo or Santa, nearly opposite to the port of Ferrol, a league distant n. and nine n. w. of Guanape Island.] Puerto Seguro. See Porto Seguro. 

PUERTO ==[[Viejo|VIEJO]]==, a district and jurisdiction of the province and government of Guayaquil in the kingdom of Quito ; one of the six which compose it, and of the greatest extent of any, since it is in length 24 leagues, and in breadth 18 : bounded on the side of the coast by the settlement of Canoa, of the province of Esmeraldas, &nd by the inaccessible mountains of Tosagua, the same being covered with the finest and largest trees, such as amarillos, colorados, figueroas, mulberrytrees and laurels, the latter as and of the and not so heavy for timbers of vessels. This district is watered by rivers flowing down from the mountains, and called Grande and Chico. The same fertilize the large gardens found on the shores of each, as also the fruitorchards and plantations of plantains, cocos, and tobacco, this being of the best quality of any in the province, as having been planted from the seed of the island of Trinidad. These estates also abound in yucas, mani, and other productions peculiar to the country. 
This territory yields 70,000 lbs. of wax annually, 80,000 bundles of tobacco, 4000 lbs. of thread of pita, 1000 lbs. of zarzaparilla ; and 4he natives make Bashes, garters, and other manufactures of cotton, cords ofcabuya, which they  large as the trees called de maria same strength,  manufacture of the threads produced from the wild thistle of maguey ; and these threads being prepared by exposure to the sun, rain, and air, they twist and make of as strong contexture as is the thread of hemp. They also weave hammocks and a sort of saddlebags from reeds, which they here call linches. Here also they gather plentiful crops of a fungus of ceibo and quiriqua, two sorts of trees. The fungus of the former is from the flower, which is of great whiteness, and as soft as silk, and so spongy that it serves to fill mattresses without the inconvenience of becoming matted, and so clean is it and open, as not to be affected or rotted by moisture ; although that if it be from time to time exposed to the dry air and sun, it becomes more open, and has a better chance of remaining sweet. The other wool is found in some round knobs, somewhat larger than the young almond, growing upon the tree ; the wood of which tree is as good as ebony, and in the cavities of the trunk of which tree lies the wool, as fine as that of the vicuna, of the same colour, and of greater ductility ; so much so, that a piece contained in one knob may be spread over the whole hand : it is with this valuable material that they stuff pillows, saddles, and, as a branch of trade, it affords a greater profit than any other article sold in these parts. This district contains 4000 inhabitants, namely, 2000 Indians, 500 Spaniards, and 1500 Mustees, divided into the following settlements :

==[[Puna|PUNA]]==, an island of the S. Sea, in the middle of the Gulf of Guayaquil. In the e. part, and at the entrance of the port, its length is from seven to eight leagues from s. w. to n. e. and its width from three to four from s. e. to n. w. It is of a quadrilong figure, and was the head seat of the province in the beginning of its establishment ; and the first Spaniard who entered it was Francisco Pizarro, in 1530. It was then commanded by Tomala, the principal cacique and lord of the natives, with which it was well peopled. Afterwards was added to its jurisdiction the settlement of Tumbez, until the same was assigned by the viceroy Don Francisco de Toledo to the territory of the corregimiento of Piura : Puna was then, from its being in the vicinity of Guayaquil, annexed as to its government with the settlements of Machala and Naranjal ; and through this runs the river Suya, which flows down from the sierra of Atuncanar of the province of Cuenca, and empties itself into the port in sight of the island of which we treat ; and it is by this river thatthe trade of the two provinces is carried on, H H  
|  n   234  and an interchange of their productions easilyeffected even during the winter : for the river is navigable for oaredboats until that it becomes united with the two rivers called Taura and Balao ; from the mouths of which the navigation is performed by sails. They have there also a method of adding to the vessel a false keel, which secures it from what the sailors term capsizing ; and they likewise use an extraordinary kind of helm, which they call guare, not known in any other part, the same being made of a junction of five boards, each of five yards long, and half a yard wide ; and which being introduced into the water at midships, answers the purpose of the regular helm, and is easily governed by a thin cane, thus enabling the vessel to stem without danger the whirlpools of the rivers and the rolling of the sea, although it is not unfrequently that it be loaded with from 200 to 300 arrobas, in sacks of flour, packages of linens and baizes, and chests of conserves and native fruits. 
[The method of adding false keels to vessels has been lately illustrated in this kingdom by the ingenuity of Sir Sydney Smith, as in the cases of the Milbrook and Netley schooners. We are creditably informed, that the Spaniards, who saw these vessels, called them the " Devil with three tails."] 
The island of Puna was peopled with 20,000 Indians, and, in 1734, by the census then taken, there were to be found no more than 96. This fallingoff is generally attributed to the severity ofthe climate, and the prevalence of the smallpox and measles. But these Indians are exempt from personal service, and, therefore, notwithstanding what has been said of the climate, their own account of their decrease is most worthy belief; and that is, that the motive of their extinction arises from the visible chastisement of Divine Justice ; for when that having relapsed into their errors of idolatry, the bishop of Truxillo had come amongst them to call them back to the fold, they put him to an ignominious death by poison; and, after having buried his body, dug it up, purified it from corruption by tobacco, and devoured it according to the barbarous customs which prevailed in the time of their earliest gentilism. 
The productions of this island are now reduced yearly to 6000 strait sticks of mangrovetrees for the manufactories of Peru, 15,000 loads of cacao, 200 arrobas of dried fish, by which the inhabitants maintain themselves ; though not less than by supplying with meat those vessels  which touch at the port of this island, and do not come close up to the city. They also derive some profit by careening large vessels, which lie here for this operation, in preference of hazarding a passage through the shoals to the dock up the river. It has no other settlements than that of its own name, and those of Machala and Naranjal already named. The port is eight leagues from the city, in long. 70° 58' w. lat. 2° 50' s.

==[[Puyzocas|PUYZOCAS]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians of the kingdom of Peru ; bounded by the nation  of the Chiquitos : discovered by Father Lucas Caballero, of the Jesuits, in 1711, who, having entered amongst these Indians to instruct them in the faith, met his death at their hands ; as did all the other unhappy Spaniards and converted Indians, who accompanied him, to the number of 26 persons.  ==[[Puyzocas|QUACHICHILES]]==, a nation of Indians, of the Chichimecas in Nueva Espana. They were most brutal in the time of their gentilism, and lived wandering through the woods and mountains, maintaining themselves by the chase, which they exercised equally against the Christians and the wild beasts ; nor did they show any marks of rationality until the time of the viceroy Don Luis de Velasco, Marquis of Salinas. They were reduced through the medium of a Mustee, called Caldera, son of a Spaniard and a Chichimecan Indian Avoman, and who had lived many years amongst these Indians. Also further to civilise them there were sent some Indians of the province of Tiaxcala, who might settle amongst them, accompanied with Fr. Geronimo de Mendieta, monk of the order of San Francisco ; who, after having catechised and baptised many, founded the settlements of the real of mines of San Luis de Potosi in the province of Zacatecas, San Miguel de Mezquitic, and Colot!an in the province of Guadalaxara ; the king being put to great expense in maintaining these Indians, whilst they were instructed in labour and agriculture.

[QUAMPEAGAN Falls, at the head of the tide on Newichwanock River, which joins Piscataqua River, 10 miles from the sea. The natives give the Falls this name, because fish was there taken with nets. At these Falls are a set of saw and other mills; and a landingplace, where great quantities of lumber is rafted on scows. Here the river has the English name of Salmon Fall* River, from the plenty of salmon there caught. In the memory of people who lived 50 years ago, these fish were so plenty as to be struck with spears on the rocks; but none now alive remember to have seen any there. The saw mills where the dam crosses the stream are the sure destruction of that species of fish. Tomcod or frostfish, smelts, and alewives, abound here. The place called Salmon Falls is covered with useful mills. Above these we meet with the Great Falls, where sawmills are continued to great advantage. On many places from Quampegan to the pond, from whence it issues, are mills for boards and corn.]

These Indians were extremely barbarous, though warlike, and, amongst their other vices, were much addicted to sodomy ; on which account Balboa ordered some of them to be burnt by way of a terror to the rest. Here also the Spaniards discovered the first Negro slaves, without being able to ascertain from whence they came.

The capital of this province is the city of the same name ; situate in a craggy spot, but of a mild temperature, very fertile and pleasant, from the abundance of its waters, which were communicated", in antient times, by several aqueducts, of beautiful architecture. 
The parish church, which is the convent of the religious order of San Franciso, although of ancient fabric, is arched all over, and magnificently adorned with precious silver ornaments. Close to it is the venerable Orden Tercera, composed of the most noble of the population, and consisting of 314 families, the greater part of Indians, and the rest of Mustees and Mulattoes ; also 622 of Indians, who are divided into nine wards, which surround the town, and which are reputed as settlements. In a chapel here, is venerated an image of Nuestra Senora de la Conception ; of the origin of which we have the following account, namely, that in the time of Hernan Cortes, there arrived at a certain estate two strangers, of handsome appearance, at the house of a virtuous woman, called Agustina, who carried with them a closed chest, the which they left in the care of the said woman to keep ; who, with the consent of her guests, tried, but in vain, to open it ; and at last, despairing of so doing, and looking in vain for the return of her guests, moreover, struck with the soft music 

VOL. IV.  which issued as it were from the chest, she gave a full account of all that had happened to the curate and alcaldia mayor ; he accordingly opened the box, in the presence of many of the inhabitants, and found in it the image of Our Lady, of foreign manufacture. 
This city was, in the time of the Indians, very strong, from the works which they had for its defence. It was gained to Hernan Cortes through the valour of a Tlaxcaltecan Indian, one of his allies, who, by virtue of his great strength, forced his way, and was followed by some Spaniards, when the cacique immediately surrendered obedience to Cortes, and aided him in the conquest of the capital ; and on this pretext it was that the Mexicans of the provinces of Maliralco and Cohuixco declared war against this cazique ; but Cortes sending to his succour 80 Spaniards, under the Captain Andres de Tapia, a battle ensued, and the Indians were entirely routed.

==[[Quauhquecholla|QUAUHQUECHOLLA]]==, a large population in the time of the Indians of Nueva Espana in their gentilism ; situate in the Valley of Atrisco, It was peopled by the Teochichimecas, who were governed by Xelhua, eldest son of Ixtac Mixcuatl, Lord of Siete Cuevas, this name having been taken from a very beautiful bird found here, and thus called. It was situate in a llanura, surrounded by a wall of nine yards high and 14 feet wide, with a good parapet, which ended in a sierra, inaccessible from its being so extremely craggy. It had only two gates ; to enter which it was necessary to ascend some steps. It had beautiful edifices, and many gardens, as its territory was very fertile : its market was celebrated, and its inhabitants consisted of 5000. Moctezuma besieged and took it, taking away 3200 prisoners. Here it was that the Mexicans formed a conjunction to carry on war against Tlaxcala. They sought assistance from Hernan Cortes, and became, by this means, victorious over their enemies.

==[[Quauhtitlan|QUAUHTITLAN]]==, a settlement of the province of Mexico in Nueva Espana : conquered and united to the empire by Izcohuatl. It was a large and populous city, and gained by HerT I  mk  ■■  m&mm  QUA  nan Cortes, who found it depopulated, when he besieged Mexico. Its natives had the barbarous custom, in their feasts to their deities, of decapitating the Indian women slaves, and then two Indian men would cover themselves with the skins of these women, performing a thousand ceremonies. They used to fix upon six very lofty stakes, firmly set in the ground so many prisoners, which they had taken in the war, and let them fall to the ground before they were dead, in order to pluck out their hearts, and they would then deliver the heads to the priests, but parted the body amongst themselves to eat. There is in this settlement a great stone causeway, built by the Spaniards, and which reaches as far as Mexico ; from whence the settlement is four leagues distant. 

==[[Quauhtinchan|QUAUHTINCHAN]]==, a settlement of the province and alcaldia mayor of Tepeaca in Nueva Espana. It was at the first a large and numerous population. Its natives put to death two children of Tlaxcala, educated in the catholic religion, who accompanied the monks Fr. Bernardino Minaya and his companion, out of revenge for their having found some idols and burnt them ; but these same executioners were hung at Mexico, together with their cacique, for thisfault. This settlement was a doctrinal establishment of the religious of San Francisco, and these, by a disposition of the Bishop of La Puebla, being changed for the religious of St. Domingo, the former set their face against the resolution, but were appeased when there was built for them a convent and church, the best in all the kingdom. There is by this convent a fountain, which irrigates the garden belonging to it; and the water of this fountain forms a crust of stone in the aqueducts through which it passes. — It is four leagues from the city of La Puebla de los Angeles.

==[[Quautlamayan|QUAUTLAMAYAN]]==, a settlement of the head settlement of the district and alcaldia mayor of Zochicoatlan, in the same kingdom as the former. It is of a cold temperature ; situate amongst mountains and deep glens ; contains 16 families of Indians ; and is the last settlement of  this jurisdiction by that part : two leagues e. of its capital. 
==[[Quautlazinco|QUAUTLAZINCO]]==, San Juan de, a settlement of the head settlement of the district and alcaldia mayor of Cholula, in the same kingdom as the former. It contains 132 families of Indians, and is half a league n. of its capital.

==[[Quazoquitengo|QUAZOQUITENGO]]==, a settlement of the head settlement of the district of San Luis, of the coast and acaldia mayor of Tlapa in the same kingdom as the former. It contains 59 families of Indians, who trade in nothing but maize, the only production of its territory. Seven leagues from its head settlement.

==[[Queaches|QUEACHES]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians of the province of Yucatan. After the conquest made by the Spaniards, they rose, committing great atrocities in some of the settlements in which they resided ; and were suppressed by the entrance of the alcaldia mayor of Chiapa, Don Diego de Vera Ordonez de Villaquiran. In 1684 its reduction was also attempted by the governor Don Juan Bruno Tello de Guzman, who made a road from the province of Yucatan to those of Guatemala, a distance of eight leagues, and a redoubt or fort for its defence : but both the one and the other have fallen to decay ; neither was the reduction of these Indians accomplished. 
==[[Quebec|QUEBEC]]==, a large and handsome city of Canada in N. America : founded in 1608, by Mr. Samuel de Champlain, by order of the court of France, to establish the commerce of skins, which the Company of the Indies carried on with the natives of that country. It is situate on the shore of the river St. Lawrence, and at the mouth where this is entered by that of St. Charles, and where the former river is narrowest, from whence it has the name of Quebec; this, in the Indian Algonquinian language, signifying strait. The city is divided into high and low; the    

QUEBEC.  former being on the top of a mountain, the latter at the foot of the same, in a territory which has been left by the river, which at the founding of the city reached as far as the skirts of the mountain. The buildings are large, and well constructed ; especially the episcopal palace, the cityhouse, that of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, of a square figure, which cost £40,000; and, above all, the palace, the residence of the governor, and where the assembly was held. The cathedral is small, and of bad architecture, and not corresponding with its steeple and belfry, which are lofty, and well designed. It has attached to it a collegial seminary, which has been rebuilt three times, from having been twice consumed by fire ; the first in 1703, and afterwards in 1705. The Recoletan fathers have a beautiful church and convent here ; and there is another of Ursuline Nuns, which, like the seminary, has been twice burnt, and, in consequence, very poor. The Jesuits had here a magnificent college. There is in this city two hospitals : one called of God, in which are two great wards, the one for men and the other for women, assisted by the hospitalmonks of St. Augustin, of the congregation of the Mercy of Jesus, whose founders passed from Dieppe ; and the other a general hospital, situate in the territory formerly occupied by the Recoletan fathers, and which was bought by the bishop, M. de Saint Vallier, who in this work spent immense sums of money. It is defended towards the river by a platform flanked with two bastions, which, at high water and spring tides, are almost level with the surface of the water. A little above the bastion, to the right, is a half bastion cut out of the rock ; a little higher a large battery, and, higher still, a square fort, in which the governor resides. The port is very convenient, and secure, for many vessels, however large they may be, and which may here lie at anchor close to the shore. The inhabitants amount to 8000 souls, amongst these, are many persons enriched by the flourishing commerce continually carried on here. 
The English, commanded by David Kerl, a Frenchman, and native of Dieppe, and a Calvinist,who passed over hither, took it in 1628. In 1690 they returned to besiege it, commanded by General Piphy ; but who was obliged to retire, with the loss of his best troops. Again, in 1759, the English took it under General Wolfe, who gloriously died in that action ; after which these became possessed of the whole of Canada. [In  
December, 1775, it was attacked by the Americans under the command of the brave General Montgomery, who was slain, and his army repulsed. For account of the present misunderstandings between the British Government and United States, see United States.] 
This city was erected into a bishopric in 1670, by his Holiness Clement X. after great solicitation by the court of France ; and, although this court presented M. St. Vallier to be first bishop, then abbot of that church, his holiness reserved the appointment entirely to himself. It is 320 miles from the sea, or entrance of the river St. Lawrence, in long. 71° 12' 6" w. lat. 46° 48' 39" n.

1. Official account of the province of Quebec in 1764. — The first document we discover, of any importance, respecting this province, is the following letter, which was written by General Murray, soon after his arrival in England, in 1766, in which year he left the government of Canada. As it is an official paper, its accuracy, of course, may be depended on. We therefore avail ourselves of the opportunity to lay it before our readers, as it affords a better picture of the situation of affairs in the province at that period, than any other account we have met with. 
" MY ==[[Lords|LORDS]]==, " In Mr. Secretary Conway's letter to me of the 24th October, 1764, I am ordered to prepare for my return to England, in order to give a full and distinct account of the present state of the province of Quebec ; of the nature and account of the disorders which have happened there ; and of my conduct and proceedings in the administration of the government. In obedience to that command, I have the honour to report as follows : — and first, the state of the province : 
" It consists of 1 1.0 parishes, exclusive of. the towns of Quebec and Montreal. These parishes contain 9722 houses, and 54,575 Christian souls ; they occupy, of arable land, 955,754 arpents. They sowed, in the year 1765, 180,300f minots of grain, and that year they possessed 12,546 oxen, 22,724 cows, 15,039 young horned cattle, 27,064 sheep, 28,976 swine, and 13,757 horses, as appears by the annexed recapitulation (recensement) taken by my order, in the year 1765. The towns of Quebec and Montreal contain about 14,700 inhabitants. The Savages, who are called Roman Catholics, living within the limits of the province, consist of 7400 souls : so that the whole, exclusive of the lung's troops, do amount to 76,275 souls ; of which, in the parishes are 19 Protestant families ; the rest of that persuasion (a few halfpay officers excepted) are traders, mechanics, and publicans, who reside in the low towns of Quebec and Montreal. Most of them were followers of the army, of mean education, or soldiers disbanded at the reduction  of the troops. All have their fortunes to make, and, I fear, few are solicitous about the means, when the end can be attained. I report them to be, in general, the most immoral collection of men I ever knew ; of course, little calculated to make the new subjects enamoured with our laws, religion, and customs ; and far less adapted to enforce these laAvs, which are to govern. 
" On the other hand, the Canadians, accustomed to arbitrary, and a sort of military government, are a frugal, industrious, and moral race of men, who, from the just and mild treatment they met with from his majesty's military officers, that ruled the country for four years, until the establishment of civil government, had greatly got the better of the natural antipathy they had to their conquerors. 
" They consist of a noblesse, who are numerous, and who pique themselves much upon the antiquity of their families, their own military glory, and that of their ancestors. These noblesse are seigniors of the whole country, and though not rich, are in a situation in that plentiful part of the world, where money is scarce, and luxury still unknown, to support their dignity. Their tenants, who pay only an annual quitrent of about a dollar for 100 acres, are at their ease, and comfortable. They have been accustomed to respect, and obey their noblesse ; their tenures being military in the feudal manner, they have shared with them the dangers of the field, and natural affection has been increased in proportion to the calamities which have been common to both, from the conquest of the country. As they have been taught to respect their superiors, and are not yet intoxicated with the abuse of liberty, they are shocked at the insults which their noblesse and the king's officers have received from the English traders and lawyers, since the civil government took place. It is natural to suppose they are zealous of their religion. They are very ignorant : it was the policy of the French government to keep them so : few or none can read. Printing was never permitted in Canada till we got possession of it. Their veneration for the priesthood is in proportion to their ignorance : it will probably decrease as they become enlightened, for the clergy there are of mean birth, and very illiterate ; and, as they are now debarred from supplies of ecclesiastics from France, that order of men will become more and more contemptible, provided they are not exposed to persecution. The state of the Roman clergy I have already described, in]   QUEBEC.  f my report to your lordship's office, in the year 1763, it will therefore be superfluous to say more on that subject here, as no alteration has happened since that time. 
" I am really ignorant of any remarkable disorders which have happened in the colony, while I commanded there ; the outrage committed on Mr. Walker, magistrate at Montreal, excepted. A thorough detail of that horrid affair I have already laid before the king's servants, in my letter to the lords of trade, of the 2d March, 1765. I have annexed a copy of that letter, in case it may not have fallen into your lordship's hands. 
" Disorders and divisions, from the nature of things, could not be avoided, in attempting to establish the civil government in Canada, agreeable to my instructions ; while the same troops, who conquered and governed the country for four years, remained in it. They were commanded by an officer, who, by the civil establishment, had been deprived of the government of half the province, and who remained, in every respect, independent of the civil establishment. Magistrates were to be made, and juries to be composed, out of 450 contemptible settlers and traders. It is easy to conceive how the narrow ideas and ignorance of such men, must offend any troops, more especially those who had so long governed them, and knew the means from which they were elevated. It would be very unreasonable to suppose, that such men would not be intoxicated with the unexpected power put into their hands ; and that they would not be eager to shew how amply they' possessed it. As there were no barracks in the country, the quartering of the troops furnished perpetual opportunities of displaying their importance and rancour. The Canadian noblesse were hated, because their birth and behaviour entitled them to respect; and the peasants were abhorred, because they were saved from the oppression they were threatened with. The resentment of the grand jury at Quebec, put % lie truth of these remarks beyond doubt. The silence of the king's servants to the governor's remonstrances in consequence of their presentments, though his secretary was sent to them on purpose to expedite an explanation, contributed to encourage the disturbers of the peace. 
" The improper choice and numbers of the civil officers sent out from England, increased the inquietudes of the colony. Instead of men of genius and untainted morals, the very reverse were appointed to the most important offices; and it was impossible to communicate,  through them, those impressions of the dignity of government, by which alone mankind can be held together in society. The judge fixed upon to conciliate the minds of 75,600 foreigners to the laws and government of Great Britain, was taken from a gaol, entirely ignorant of civil law, and of the language of the people. The attorneygeneral, with regard to the language of the people, was not better qualified. The offices of secretary of the province, register, clerk of the council, commissary of stores and provisions, provost martial, &c. were given by patent to men of interest in England, who let them out to the best bidders ; and so little did they consider the capacity of their representatives, that not one of them understood the language of the natives. As no salary was annexed to these patent places, the value of them depended upon the fees, which by my instructions I was ordered to establish, equal to those of the richest ancient colony. This heavy tax, and the rapacity of the English lawyers, were severely felt by the poor Canadians ; but they patiently submitted, and though stimulated to dispute it by some of the licentious traders from New York, they, cheerfully obeyed the stamp act, in hopes that their good behaviour would recommend them to the favour and protection of their sovereign. 
" As the council books of the province, and likewise my answers to the complaints made against my administration, have been laid before your lordships, it is needless to presume to say anything further on that subject, than that I glory in having been accused of warmth and firmness in protecting the king's Canadian subjects, and of doing the utmost in my power to gain to my royal master, the affections of that brave, hardy people, whose emigration, if ever it should happen, will be an irreparable loss to this empire ; to prevent which, I declare to your lordships, I would cheerfully submit to greater calumnies and indignities (if greater can be devised) than hitherto I have undergone. 
" I have the honour to be, &c." 
From the contents of this letter, it appears evident that much cordiality could not exist between the French inhabitants and the British settlers. The former were a people who prided themselves on their ancestry, and consequently despised the latter, who were of mean birth, and possessed of still meaner abilities. The mutual disgust and jealousy which were thus created, tended very considerably to depreciate the state of the colony for some years : commerce declined rather than increased, nor did she raise her droop-]  r^*-T."

QUEBEC.  
[ing head till order and regularity were introduced. 
2. Further description of the town and environs. — Quebec is most properly denominated the key of the river St. Lawrence, for the river contracts suddenly opposite to the city, being there only about a mile in breadth ; whereas the basin of Quebec, immediately below, is from four to five miles in breadth ; and the river widens immediately above the city. The grand battery of Quebec is opposite to the narrowest part of the river, and is an extensive range of very heavy ordnance, besides some 13-inch mortars, which, if properly served, must destroy any vessels which might attempt to pass, or come near enough to injure the town. 
The river opposite to Quebec is about 100 feet in depth, and affords good anchorage : for a considerable way above Quebec it is navigable for ships of any size. Indeed, large ships go as high up as Montreal, which is near 200 miles above Quebec. 
The site of Quebec seems to have been destined by nature for the capital of an empire. The surrounding country is magnificent; and it is seen to great advantage from Cape Diamond, which overlooks the great river, and is the termination of the Plains of Abraham. 
The general course of the river St. Lawrence is from sJw. ton.e. Above the island of Orleans, the St. Lawrence expands, and a basin is formed by the junction of a river called the St. Charles, which comes from a lake of the same name, situated amongst the mountains towards the n. After passing an Indian village, about 10 miles from Quebec, called Lorette, situated upon elevated ground, the St. Charles takes its course through a plain, which is separated from the great river by a ridge of high land, about nine miles in length, extending from a place called Cape Rouge to Cape Diamond. The general breadth of this ridge is from one to two miles. Cape Diamond is a bold promontory, advancing into the river St. Lawrence, of an elevation of 350 feet above the river, nearly perpendicular ; and the bank, the whole way to Cape Rouge, is nearly of the same elevation, rising from the river almost perpendicular: the ridge slopes towards the n. till it reaches the valley, through which the river St. Charles runs. This ridge of land has every appearance of having been an island, surrounded by the great river. The valley is full of large round stones, and other matter, which indicate the presence of water at no very remote period, and the operation of a strong current.  
On the n. e. or lower end of the peninsula, Quebec is situated; and the line of its fortifications runs from the river St. Charles, across to the top of the bank which overlooks the St. Lawrence ; the distance is about half a mile : and from the line of fortification to the point of Cape Diamond the distance is about a quarter of a mile : within this space stands the city of Quebec. It consists, as Alcedo has observed, of an Upper and Lower Town : the Upper Town may be said to be situated on Cape Diamond, at least upon the side of it which slopes towards the river St. Charles. It is elevated about 15 feet above the Lower Town, and separated from it by a line of steep rocks, which run from the cape towards the river St. Charles. Formerly the river St. Lawrence, at high water, came up close to these rocks ; but as the tide rises and falls here about 15 feet, it gave an opportunity of taking from the river a considerable space ; wharfs were built at low watermark, and even at some places beyond it, and the intermediate ground filled up to such a height that it remained dry at high water. Upon this situation streets were laid out, and houses built. These streets run from the upper side of Cape Diamond down to the river St. Charles, a distance of about half a mile; they are of considerable breadth, and the houses are large and commodious ; those next the river have attached to them very extensive warehouses (called, in the language of Quebec, hangards), and vessels come close to the wharfs to discharge their cargoes ; at some of them the vessels remain afloat at low water, at others, which are not carried so far out, or where the river does not deepen so suddenly, the vessels lie dry at low water. 
The Lower Town is not included in the fortifications, but the passes to it are commanded by the batteries in the line of fortification which surrounds the Upper Town ; so that the approach by land to the Lower Town will hardly be attempted by an enemy. It is true the Americans attempted it in the winter of 1775, but they were repulsed with great slaughter. 
The communication from the Lower Town to the Upper Town is by a winding street, at the top of which is a fortified gate. On entering this gate, you find on the righthand a large area, in which is situated the house (dignified with the title of a palace) in which the bishops of Quebec formerly resided ; at present it is used for public offices, and accommodates the supreme council and house of assembly. Beyond the palace you have the grand battery, on which are mounted J  

QUEBEC.  [many pieces of heavy artillery, besides mortars, which certainly command the channel of the great  river. 
Turningto the left, soon after enteringthe *mte, you find yourself in another area or square ; on the side next the river you see the Chateau de St. Louis, in which the governor resides. It is situated on the brink of a precipice, and you have the Lower Town of Quebec under your feet. The view from the gallery at the back of the chateau is extensive and grand. Opposite to the chateau, on the other side of the square, you have the English church, a very elegant building; and the courthouse, where elegance is not so conspicuous. On the n. side of the square you have a very handsome building, erected for, and used as, a tavern, hotel, and assemblyroom. 
In the neighbourhood of this square you find towards the n. an extensive area, in which is situated the Upper Town markethouse ; a building perfectly unique in its kind. One does not know which to be most astonished at, whether the want of taste in the architect, or that his plans met with approbation : suffice it to say, that on a building one story high, you have a dome as large as that of St. Paul's in London. Never were the rules of architecture and commonsense more outraged. 
From the area of the marketplace different streets diverge, leading to the different gates of the city, viz. Hope Gate, Palace Gate, St. John's Gate, and St. Lewis's Gate, besides the gate what was  how much they formerly have suffered from it, one ceases to be surprised. 
A society has been formed, called the Fire Society : they elect a president and other officebearers annually. The object of this society is to assist in the extinguishing of fire, for which pur pose they have several engines and firemen; indeed, in case of fire, almost every man may be said to be a fireman, for every body lends his assistpoor people who have been very active  ance ; receive pecuniary reward from the society. Their funds are raised by annual voluntary subscription. 
Many of the best houses and most valuable warehouses are covered with tin plates, which make not only a very beautiful and very durable roof, but are also a complete security against fire. The reason that fire has spread so rapidly in Quebec has been, that the shingles, when once inflamed, being extremely light, were blown by the wind to an incredible distance, and operated on other shingle roofs like a shower of fire. Now, the tin plates receive the burning shingles with impunity : it might be imagined that the tin plates would rust, but this is not the case. Some of the roofs are near 40 years old, and they not only remain perfectly bright, but have never required any repairs ; so that although somewhat expensive at first, a tinplate roof will be a saving in the end. 
Quebec, on the n., n. e., and s. sides, is so strongly fortified by the nature of the ground, that little has been left for the engineer to do ; however, has been done :  leading to the Lower Town ; these streets constitute the Upper Town. Outside of St. John's and Palace Gates there are extensive suburbs, which are increasing in size daily. 
There is nothing in the appearance of Quebec itself which strikes one as being very different from an English town, except, perhaps, the roofs of the houses ; they are generally covered with boards or shingles, and you always see on the roofs several ladders, for the sake of easy access in case of fire. 
A shingle roof so much resembles a slate one, that when they are painted a slate colour, you cannot know the one from the other ; the only evil attending them is, that they are liable to catch fire : from this circumstance, Quebec has formerly suffered greatly from fires. A law has been passed, encouraging the covering houses with boards in place of shingles, and, indeed, prohibiting the latter altogether. 
The dread of fire in Quebec is greater than in most other places; but when it is considered  necessary, river  and the river St. Charles  and as the great surround, in a manner, the fortifications in these directions, and in some places come very near the bottom of the rocks, no enemy, if a common  degree of  vigilance  is observed, can hope to  succeed by an attack on these quarters. 
The least defensible part of Quebec is towards the 5. w. y where the line of fortifications extends from one side of the peninsula to the other, enclosing the city and highest part of Cape Diamond. There a cavallier battery has lately been erected, which commands the ground to a considerable distance from the walls. 
The ground, for a great extent to the s.w.. of the city of Quebec, is called the Plains of Abraham, famous for the battle in which General Wolfe beat the French. These plains are nearly on a level with the fortifications, and widen as you retire from them to the extent of from one to two miles, preserving the level nearly throughout, but sloping a little both ways, particularly towards the river St. Charles on the «, On]  
■   QUEBEC.  
[the side towards the St. Lawrence the bank is of great height ; almost pependicular, and generally covered with wood where the slope will admit of it, which is not always the case. Notwithstanding the difficulty of ascent, General Wolfe, with infinite labour, contrived to carry his little army, and a few small fieldpieces, to the top of the bank, and took his stand on the Plains of Abraham. 
The French were astonished, on looking out in the morning, to find him there ; they came out of the city and gave him battle. He beat them, and followed them close up to the walls of the town. 
It was very unaccountable,, that the French should resolve to come out of a strong fortification (where they might long have resisted the assailants), and put themselves on a footing with their enemies. Besides the troops in the city of Quebec, the French had 10,000 men encamped at Beauport, within a few miles of Quebec. If an arrangement had taken place with those troops, that they should attack Wolfe at the moment the garrison sallied forth, his little army must have been cut to pieces. To this error we owe Quebec. 
The French general, Montcalm, as well as the brave Wolte, fell in the engagement ; very different, however, must have been their feelings in their last moments. The conduct of the Frenchman, in rashly sacrificing his troops and the interests of his country, could not bear reflection. Wolfe saw his troops triumphant; they had beaten the enemy : he died in the arms of victory. 
On the spot where Wolfe fell, a stone is shown on which it is said he was laid. It is very much mutilated, from the curiosity of strangers who wish to carry off a bit of it, as a kind of relic. One cannot help feeling a good deal interested in traversing a field of battle ; — the glory which we attach to the death of the hero who falls in his country's cause, sanctifies the ground on which he fell. 
The Upper Town of Quebec being on a great elevation, enjoys fine air, and a commanding view of the surrounding country, which affords the most sublime scenery in nature. Those who have seen most of the fine views in Europe, have said they do not surpass, or even equal, that from the flagstaff of Quebec on Cape Diamond. 
The majestic St. Lawrence under your feet, receives the waters of the river St. Charles, and forms the basin of Quebec, from three to four  miles across ; further on you see the river dividing itself into two branches, forming the beautiful island of Orleans : on the opposite side of the great river, a finely wooded country, terminating at Point Levi, conceals the course and bed of one of the branches of the river ; the island of Orleans, the falls of Montmorency, strike the observer ; and the villages of Beauport, Charlebourg, and Lorrette, appear at a distance, and render the woods in which they are embosomed more interesting. The eye follows the n. branch of the St. Lawrence till it is lost amongst the distant mountains. To the s. you look over a level country for upwards of 60 miles, till the view is bounded by mountains. This extensive tract is still in a great measure in a state of nature ; nothing to be seen but the stately forest in all its majesty. 
In this prospect it is difficult to imagine a more happy blending of art and nature ; villages, country houses, cottages, corn fields, are combined with primeval woods, fine rivers, beautiful islands, magnificent waterfalls, towering hills, and lofty mountains. 
From the scenery which surrounds Cape Diamond let us return to the Cape itself. In the whole extent of the ridge, from Cape Diamond to Cape Rouge, what generally prevails is a coarse incomplete sort of schistus, the lamina? of which, when exposed to the operation of the atmosphere, moulder into a dark browncoloured earth ; it never can be used for building to any advantage, unless it is defended from the action of the air. 
Cape Diamond abounds with very fine specimens of quartz, or rock crystals. They are discovered from the brilliancy of their reflecting surfaces ; they sparkle like the diamond, and hence the place had its name. On examination, they will generally be found to be pentagons, terminating in a point, and possessing naturally much of the brilliancy and polish of a cut diamond; and they are so hard, that, like a diamond, they cut glass. 
But there are some buildings in this city, which it would be improper to pass over without fuller notice. 
The residence of the governor is a large plain stone building, erected, we believe, by General Haldimand, and forming one side of the open place or square called the Parade. Opposite to it stands the English cathedral church and the courthouse, both handsome buildings of modern construction. The other sides of the Parade are formed by the Union Hotel, in a line with some]  

QUEBEC.  [large dwellinghouses, and opposite by a row of buildings which form the commencement of St. Louis Street. 
The old chateau, or castle of St. Louis, is built upon the verge of an inacessible part of the rock, and separated by a courtyard from the new building which fronts the parade. 
It was formerly occupied by the governor for his residence ; but on the erection of the other was converted into public offices. It has lately undergone considerable improvements, for the use of Sir James Craig : it was then raised one story higher, and the expenses* were to be defrayed by the colony, agreeable to an act passed for that purpose by the provincial parliament. It is now finished, and thought to possess every requisite for the abode of the most distinguished person in the colony. Its situation, for fine prospects and extensive views of the river and surrounding country, cannot be surpassed in any part of the Upper Town. Behind the building is a large stone gallery or balcony, even with the lower apartments. This gallery, which serves as a very agreeable promenade, is situated more than 250 feet above the level of the river, and commands a beautiful panorama view of the Lower Town, the shipping in the river, Point Levi, the island of Orleans, shores of Beauport and distant mountains, a scene as grand and extensive as it is possible for the imagination to conceive, or the eye to survey. 
The college of the Jesuits is situated in the market, and now makes very excellent barracks for the soldiers. As the Jesuits in Canada, as well as in different parts of the world, were once a very powerful body of men, and possessed more influence for a time over the people among whom they lived, than even the sovereigns themselves, it may be amusing, and perhaps instructive, to describe them as they existed in that country about 60 years ago, at which period their power, though on the decline, was yet considerable. At this day not an individual of that society is alive in Canada, the British government having prohibited the religious male orders, the priests excepted, from augmenting their numbers. The government faithfully allowed the orders to enjoy the whole of their revenues, as long as there existed a single individual of the body ; but on his death the property reverted to the crown. 
The building in which the Jesuits resided is well laid out ; and when occupied by them, and in good order and repair, must have been the handsomest building in Canada. It consists of stone, and is three stories high, above which are 

VOL. IV.  garrets, with a sloping roof covered with slate, even at this day in a good state of preservation ; a circumstance which it is surprising has not induced the inhabitants to cover their houses with slate, as they could import it from Scotland cheaper than tin. The college is built in a square form, and includes a large courtyard within. In every story there is a long walk, on both sides of which the brethren had their private cells or rooms, exclusive of the public halls, refectory, library, apothecary's shop, and other apartments for general use. A large orchard and kitchen -garden was situated on the s. side of the building. A part of the trees in the former were the remains of the forest which covered the mountain when the French began to build the city, and are in existence at the present day. 
The interior economy of the college was well regulated. The Jesuits used to dine in a great hall, around which were placed long tables with seats between them and the walls, but not on the opposite side. On one side the refectory was a pulpit, in which, during meals, one of the fathers used to read some religious book ; but when visitors dined with them, this practice was omitted: the time being generally employed in conversation. Their dinners were always good; and when company was present, their dishes were as numerous as at a great feast. They never permitted a woman to reside among them. All were fathers or brothers, the latter of whom were young men brought up to be Jesuits ; they used to prepare every thing for dinner in the hall, and bring it on table ; the common servants not being admitted. 
The revenue of the Jesuit Society was very considerable, being upwards of £12,000 per annum at the time it reverted to the crown. It had been for seA r eral years enjoyed solely by an old father, who had survived all the rest. This Jesuit, whose name was Jean Joseph Casot, was a native of Switzerland, and born in 1728. In his youth he was no more than porter to the college ; but having considerable merit, he was promoted, and in the course of time received into the order. He had the character of possessing an amiable and generous disposition, and employed his large income in charitable purposes. He died a few years ago at a very advanced age. For some time previous to his death, he shut himself up in his apartments, and became inaccessible to all but his attendants. The crown, on his demise, came into possession of the property, for the management of which commissioners have been appointed. The lands] 
K K  
--.-  ==[[Quebec|QUEBEC]]==,  [which belonged to that body, as well indeed as to the religious orders in general, are by far the best in the country, and produce the greatest revenues. 
The French seminary, or college, at Quebec, is situated close to the French cathedral, between the marketplace and the ramparts. The building is spacious, and substantially built, though, like most of the public edifices in Quebec, it has suffered much from fire. It was burned down in 1703, and again in 1705, when just rebuilt. At the back of the seminary there is a very extensive garden, well laid out, and possessing every requisite that can contribute to the recreation of the students. It commands a beautiful view of the river, the island of Orleans, and the opposite shores. The seminary was originally instituted to bring up students for the priesthood. No funds were allowed for the education of youth in general ; but since the conquest, it has admitted scholars without limitation of number, for an acknowledgment of 5s. per annum for outpensioners, and ^12 10s. for boarders. The boys educated there at present are numerous, and chiefly the children of the French inhabitants. Those intended for the church remain there till their education is completed, or till a parish can be given them. 
The nunneries have not been restricted by government, consequently they are in general well filled. The Hotel de Dieu is a large building, situate, with its gardens, near Palace Gate. It was founded in 1638 by the Duchess d'Aiguillon, who sent from the hospital at Dieppe three nuns, for the purpose of commencing this charitable institution. It consists of an hospital for the sick, who are received here, and attended by the nuns, without any expense to the patients. The invalids of both sexes are comfortably lodged in wards, and every attention paid to them by the sisters, of whom there are about 27, with a superior. 
The convent of Ursulines was instituted in 1639 by a rich young widow in France, Madame de la Peltrie, for the education of female children. It belongs to a superior and 36 nuns, who instruct the girls in reading, embroidery, and fine work ; no men are allowed to visit this or any of the convents without permission from the bishop. The sisters of St. Ursula are more strict and recluse than those of the other convents. They have a large garden adjoining theirhouse, which supplies them with a variety of fruits, herbs, and vegetables, a portion of which they sell to the inhabitants • for their institution  is not very rich. They also employ themselves with embroidery, pickling, and preserving of fruits and vegetables, which are disposed of for the benefit of the society. This convent, like the rest of the public buildings in Canada, has suffered twice or three times by fire. It is now substantially built of stone, and the roof covered with tin. 
The general hospital, which is situated some distance out of the town, on the banks of the river St. Charles, surrounded by meadow lands, is the third convent belonging to Quebec. It was founded about the year 1693 by M. de St. Vallier, bishop of Quebec, for the purpose of affording support and relief to the infirm, the aged, the sick, and wounded poor, of both sexes, and in this charitable and praiseworthy service it continues to this day. A superior and 37 sisters fulfil the duties of the institution in a manner that does them the highest honour, and entitles them to the gratitude and thanks of the public. Their religious duties are performed without relaxing those of humanity, and their leisure moments are spent in useful and ornamental works, the profits of which assist the revenues of the hospital. 
We cannot quit this cursory notice of the female religious institutions at Quebec, without paying them tribute of applause to which they are justly entitled. Few, it is true, go into those holy receptacles, but such as are tired of the world. They are either satiated with its pleasures, or disgusted with its cares. But the objects for which they leave the world, are not to live in easy idleness, or careless indifference. Two out of three institutions bestow their time, attention, and property, upon the sick and aged poor. The other devotes the services of its sisters to the education and instruction of young females. Such are the charitable offices performed by the Canadian nuns, whose religious duties are equally meritorious. The existence, therefore, of these religious orders, we conceive to be highly advantageous to the people of Canada, and serviceable to the government. In a Catholic country, governed and regulated by the liberal constitution of England, those institutionsare rendered of the utmost public utility. 
To conclude, the Upper Town is certainly the most agreeable part of Quebec, both in summer and winter. In the former season, the heat is not so intense as in many parts of the Lower Town, nor in winter is it so dreary and dull. The cold is, however, severer by several degrees. Even between Cape Diamond and the Upper]  
-.  m%    %  
"*—*  of U E B E a  [Town, there is frequently a difference in the weather of nearly 10 degrees. The thermometer in February 1807 was 20 degrees below 0. in St. Louis Street, and on the Cape SO below 0. The latter being elevated upwards of 70 feet above the former. 
The streets in the Upper Town are not remarkable for width ; but many of them are tolerably paved, yet a considerable part of the town remains without that beneficial iu provement. A fortified town, confined like Quebec to the summit and base of a steep rock, is not very well adapted either for convenient streets or elegant buildings. They must always be regulated by the localities of its situation. But much more might certainly have been effected for general comfort and convenience, had this place fallen into the hands of any other than a Roman Catholic people, whose numerous religious institutions have occupied nearly onehalf the town. Their large buildings and extensive gardens were not of so much consequence in the early settlement of Quebec ; but when population increased, those who would otherwise have lived within the walls, were obliged, for want of room, to reside without ; and have formed what are called the suburbs of St. John, St. Rocque, &c. 
Since the conquest, improvements have gone on but slowly, owing to the fluctuating state of commerce ; from which source alone the means can be provided. 
3. Provisions. — The markets are supplied with beef, mutton, pork, and veal, by the Habitans, as well as the butchers ; though the latter generally feed their own cattle, and kill them for sale as they want. Their meat is frequently better than that of the country people. The fattest pork that can be procured is bought by the lower order of the Canadians, who scarcely eat any other meat. The Habitans, in particular, live for months upon pork ; a small piece of which, boiled down with some peas or beans into a soup, constitutes their chief dish. The veal sold by the Habitans is in general very young, as red as beef, and does not eat well. 
During Lent, the French people live upon fish and vegetables, which they contrive to di'ess in the most palatable manner. The day after Good Friday the butchers make a show of their meat, somewhat similar to our butchers before Christmas. The former decorate their meat with flowers and ribbons in order to tempt their customers, though one would think that but little inducement was necessary to invite them to eat after so  long a fast. The Catholics, at the close of Lent, have a regale, and the butchers do not neglect to take advantage of that propitious moment. The finest quarters and joints are ticketed with the names of those happy people, who are alert enough to rise at three or four o'clock in the morning and get to market before their neighbours. 
The dogs in little carts, which are mentioned by Mr. Weld and former writers, are now not much in use, except by boys ; every thing is brought to market in carts, or sleighs, drawn by horses. The markets of Quebec are well supplied with every thing the country affords. In summer the following articles are brought to market by the Habitans and generally sold at the price affixed to them, in sterling money. 
Meat. Beef per lb. \\d. to 4c?. Mutton per lb. 4c?. to Gd. Lamb per quarter 3s. Gd. to 4s. 6d. Veal 6d. to Id. per lb. Pork 5d. to Gd. per lb. Sausages.

In winter a portion only of the above articles are brought to market. As soon as the river between Quebec and the island of Orleans is frozen over, a large supply of provision is received from that island. The Canadians at the commencement of winter kill the greatest part of their stock, which, as has been before observed, they carry to market in a frozen state. The inhabitants of the towns then supply themselves with a sufficient quantity of poultry and vegetables till spring, and keep them in garrets or cellars. As Ions; as they remain frozen, they preserve their goodness, but they will not keep long after they have thawed. 
Walnuts and filberts are by no means common in Canada, and are procured principally by importation from England. Hickory and hazel nuts are met with in the forests. The English  walnut trees do not thrive well in Canada ; and it has been remarked by naturalists, that the European trees were always more forward in their leaves and flowers, than the native trees of America ; in consequence of which they were very often blighted, by the cold nights, which are frequent in the early part of the spring ; while the American trees, which did not leaf or flower so soon, were generally preserved. 
Cherries are seldom seen in the markets ; they are the production only of gentlemen's gardens. Two sorts of wild cherries are plentifully scattered over the country. They are, probably, mere varieties, though they differ materially in flavour. They are called choke cherries by the inhabitants, and seldom applied to any other purpose than the making of liquor. The berries with their stones are bruised, and put into bottles of rum, brandy, or gin, with sugar ; and, in the course of a fortnight, they make a very agreeable liquor, resembling noyau. 
Melons of various kinds are cultivated in great plenty in Canada. The water and musk melon are most general. They do not thrive so well about Quebec as at Three Rivers and Montreal. They are sown frequently on hotbeds, but oftener in the open fields and gardens, and the summer heat is sufficient to ripen them without the aid of glasses. A species of yellow fly is often very destructive to the early plants, and sometimes totally destroys them. 
4. Navigation of the river St. Lawrence. — Quebec seems admirably situated to become the capital of an empire. The uninterrupted navigable part of the St. Lawrence is of gi'eat extent ; near 500 miles, which is the distance between the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Montreal, where, are found vessels of from 300 to 400 tons burden. In its course it receives a number of fine rivers, Avhich open a communication with the country on both sides. The lake Champlain, 120 miles in length, communicates with the St. Lawrence by means of the river Sorel (or Chambly, as it is sometimes called), and is the natural channel for the produce of the fine country surrounding this lake. 
Although the ship navigation ends at Montreal, another species of navigation commences, suitable to the waters to be navigated, and to the commodities to be transported. Bateaux, and canoes, convey to Upper Canada, and the country round the lakes, and to the n. w. territories, the European commodities they want ; and with the aid of scows, floats, and rafts, carry]  

QUEBEC.  [down to Montreal and Quebec the surplus produce of these immense regions, as yet of trifling amount it is true, compared with the commerce of Europe ; but when one reflects on the variety of climate, of soil, and of productions, which these extensive countries display; and the facility given to the transportation of goods by means of so many fine rivers and large lakes ; one cannot help concluding that it is destined at some future period to be one of the most commercial countries on earth. 
The river St. Lawrence must ever be the grand outlet to the ocean for the productions of all that tract of country between the United States and Hudson's Bay, including the lakes Erie, Ontario, Michigan, and Lake Superior. Although the lakes are not immediately connected with the Atlantic by any other river than the St. Lawrence, yet there are several rivers that fall into the Atlantic, which rise so near the sources of others that run into the lakes, and each navigable for boats so near their sources, that by means of them, and of a very short land carriage, trade may be carried on between the Atlantic and the lakes. There are three channels for this trade which particularly demand attention ; the first by the Mississippi and Ohio, and thence up the Wabash, Miami, and Muskingum, from the heads of which there are portages of from one to 15 miles, to the rivers which fall into the Lake Erie : secondly, along the Patowmack river (which flows past Washington City), and from thence into the Cayahoga, Bigbeaver, and Yahogany, to Presque Isle, on Lake Erie : thirdly, along Hudson's River (which falls into the Atlantic at New York), and the Mohawk River, Wood Creek, Lake Oneida, and Oswego River, which falls into Lake Ontario. In the course of time there will be a competition amongst the settlers on these different routs, which shall have most of the trade of the western territory, but they must all yield to the St. Lawrence, which commands a decided preference, because the distance to a port where vessels from the ocean can load, is shorter than by any of the other routs, and the portages are not so long; and besides, during the summer months, the rivers in the United States have so little water near their sources, that the length of the portages must be greatly increased. In the St. Lawrence they are always the same. 
When we consider the many millions of acres which communicate with this river and surround the lakes, where, at present you have only the stately pine, the hardy oak, and many other te-  nants of the forest ; and where in course of time will be seen the golden harvest, the lowing herd, the bleating flock, and the sons and daughters of industry and innocence : the heart expands with secret pleasure, and tastes in anticipation the happiness in reserve for posterity. 
Man in civilised society is naturally a commer* cial animal; he is seldom satisfied with what he possesses ; he must be changing one thing for another ; he is prompted to it by his wants, and when he can find in any one place such things as he may desire to have, thither he resorts. This formerly gave birth to fairs ; and it has made some cities perpetual fairs. It has made London the first city in the world ; and it will continue Quebec as the first city in the Canadas ; perhaps it may become the first in America, for it has a much more extensive communication with the interior of America than the new city of Washington, or any other city of America. Neither the Patowmac, Chesapeake, Delaware, nor Hudson's River, are at all to be compared to the St. Lawrence, either in magnitude or extent of back country. It is worthy of notice, that a person may go from Quebec to New Orleans, at the mouth of the Mississippi, by water the whole way, except about the space of one mile from the source of the Illinois River, to the source of a river which falls into Lake Michigan. 
Quebec is already considerably extended beyond the walls : there may in time be as much difficulty in finding out the old walls and old city of Quebec, as there is in finding the bounds of the old city of London. The river St. Charles, which at present covers unnecessarily a great deal of ground, may be confined to a narrow channel, and will be a fine situation for extending the Lower Town as far as Beauport. Wharfs and quays will of course arise : the situation is excellent for dry and wet docks ; and warehouses without number may be eligibly situated. It is thought the French had this in contemplation, and even went so far as to make a plan of it. 
5. Mode of travelling in the summer. — Travelling in Canada is certainly not altogether so pleasant as travellingin England. The Canadian calesh is a very sorry vehicle, compared to the English postchaise; nor are the auberges quite so comfortable as English inns. A person who had been accustomed to travel only in England, would say, that a Canadian calesh, with its two wheels and single horse, without springs, and without cushions, was not fit for a Christian to be put into- : and as to the auberges, or inns,]  

JKm*i  
"  QUEBEC  
[that they were such filthy places, that you might lodge in a hogstye without your olfactory nerves being more offended. 
There is certainly great room for improvement, both in the form of the calesh, and the comforts and accommodations of the inns. It adds greatly, however, to the comfort of travelling in Canada, that you are every where treated with the greatest politeness and attention. A Canadian aubergiste (landlady) the moment you stop, receives you at the door with a degree of politeness and urbanity which is as unexpected as it is pleasing. Voulez vous Men, Monsieur, avoir la complaisance aVentrer ; voila une chaise, Monsieur ; asseye% vous s'il vous plait. If they have got any thing you want, it is given at once with a good grace. If they have not, they tell you so in such a tone and manner, as to shew that they are sorry for it. Je n'en ai point, Monsieur ; J' en suis mortip.ee. The Canadian innkeeper is frequently a farmer also, or a shopkeeper. Indeed, you need never be at a loss for a house to stop at. There is not a farmer, shopkeeper, nay nor even a seigneur, or country gentleman, who, on being civilly applied to for accommodation, will not give you the best bed in the house, and every accommodation in his power. The Canadians seem to have brought the old French politeness with them to this country, and to have handed it down to the present generation. One is more surprised to find here courtesy and urbanity, from the little likelihood that such plants would exist, far less flourish, in the wilds of Canada. 
During the months of July and August travelling in Canada is very uncomfortable from the great heat of the weather. The thermometer generally shews near 80° : however, where the occasion is very urgent, the inconvenience is not so great as to prevent you. In September the heat is more moderate, and travelling becomes pleasant. 
From Quebec to Montreal the distance is about 180 miles. You may either hire a calesh to go the whole way, or take a calesh from posthouse to posthouse. If you proceed direct, they generally make 24 posts ; and you get into Montreal on the morning of the third day, without travelling in the night time. The usual charge for posting is Is. 3d. a league, which is much cheaper than posting in England. Indeed, it ought to be so, considering the nature of the vehicle, and your having only one horse ; besides, hay and corn are much cheaper here than in Eng-  land, and there is no posthorse duty. In the course of the journey to Montreal you are now and then tempted to stop, or to go a little out of your way, for the purpose of seeing a few places of note. You behold, every where, fine interesting scenery ; the road runs the whole way along the river St. Lawrence ; its banks and islands vary their appearance every hour, and keep the mind continually occupied and amused. 
The road differs from all others, inasmuch as it may be said to be almost a continued street ; one house succeeding another so quickly, as that there is scarcely a mile without one. Except the town of Trios Rivieres (Three Rivers), you have scarcely any place that deserves the name of a town : but every parish church has a village in its neighbourhood : and of these there are, between Quebec and Montreal, upwards of 20. In these little villages we see the beginnings of, perhaps, large county towns ; for here the parishes contain as much ground as many of the counties do in England. 
6. Nature of the seigneuries, Sec. — The quick succession of houses on this road arose from the manner in which the lands were granted. The whole course of the river on botli sides, from its mouth to within about 30 miles above Montreal, was divided by the French king into a certain number of seigneuries, or lordships, which were given to those who had influence enough to procure them : but they were bound to concede them in certain lots, to such of the inhabitants of tho country as might apply for them ; who were, at the same time, bound to settle upon the lands, and clear them of the woods ; keep open the highways, and perform certain other services. The lots ran along the course of the river, a certain number of yards in front, by so many in depth. In front they were very narrow, generally but three square acres ; however they run back into the country a considerable way, generally about 80 square acres. The side of a square acre is about 70 yards. 
The first thing to be done was to build a house, and open a road to communicate with their next neighbours. They then, by degrees, cleared and cultivated their land. In this way a road was made, and the country cleared by the sides of the river, where even now the great bulk of the population of Canada is found. The first settlers had additional reasons for clearing the lands, and settling along the course of the river. It enabled them to communicate with Quebec easily by means of canoes ; and in winter, when thej  

QUEBEC.  [heavy snows fall, their settling near each other enabled them to keep open the communication, by uniting' their efforts, which is still the case. 
We are told, that, after a fall of snow, one man drives his sledge to his next neighbour (a very difficult matter sometimes), who joins him with his cattle in going to the next, and so on, till a path is trodden sufficiently hard to bear the horses. 
The cultivated land does not extend far back in general. When the seigneurs, or lords of the manor, had granted, or, as it is called here, conceded those lots of their seigneurie, or lordship, which fronted the river, they made fresh concessions (behind the first) of the lands which receded still further. On the first grants, or concessions, there is always left a certain portion of wood for domestic purposes, and for fuel ; this tract of wood forms a boundary between the first and second concession. When the soil happens to be good, or the situation to be attended with very favourable circumstances, four or five concessions have taken place ; and they are now increasing in the ratio of the population. But tracts of primeval wood are still preserved between the different concessions, or grants ; from which circumstance the country retains, and will long retain, a wooded wild appearance. 
When you meet with rivers which run into the St. Lawrence, you see cultivation carried up their banks much further. Indeed, it is on the banks of such rivers where the best land is generally found ; such as the river Quelle, river De Sud, river Chambly or Sorel, river De Loup, &c. 
The Canadians are, on the whole, but poor farmers. It is true the land is the property of those who cultivate it : but their capitals are generally so limited, and, their farms so small, that they cannot afford to make experiments : and when, to this, you add their total want of education, and consequent ignorance of every thing that does not come within the scope of their own limited observation, you cease to be surprised that the country should be so badly cultivated. 
The Canadian farmer is not sufficiently aware of the value of manures, and of artificial grasses: nor does he seem to reflect, that it is more advantageous to have a small farm of good land in high cultivation, than a large farm halflaboured or neglected.— He ploughs the same field, and sows in it the same sort of grain, 20 times over ; he does not think of a routine of crops, nor does he renovate the exhausted soil. by the addition of manures ; the only remedy he knows for land so exhausted as to yield little or no return, is, to  let it lie fallow for some time. It is in vain to endeavour to convince him of his error : nothing but example will produce any good effect. — This they begin to have. Some of the farmers are a little more enlightened than the generality of them : they have ventured to listen to reason, and to reflect upon the comparative value of different modes of treating their lands ; and they begin to make innovations in their ancient systems of farming. 
One of the principal causes of the poverty, not only of the Canadian farmer, but also of all ranks amongst them, is the existence of an old French law, by which the property of either a father or mother is, on the death of either, equally divided amongst their children. Nothing seems more consonant to the clearest principles of justice than such a laW; yet it assuredly is prejudicial to society. 
In this country (or indeed in any other) an estate, with a good house upon it, convenient and appropriate offices, and a good stock of cattle, may be well cultivated, and support, creditably, a numerous family. If the head of the family dies, leaving half a dozen children, the estate and whole property is divided amongst them, which happens here every day. Each of the sons takes possession of his own lot, builds a house, marries, and has a family. The value of the whole property is very much lessened. He who gets the lot, with the dwellinghouse and offices, which served for the whole estate, gets what is out of ail proportion to the means he now has of employing them : he can neither occupy them, nor keep them in repair. The other lots are generally too small to supply the expenses of a family, or enable their owners to support that state of respectability in the country which their father did ; so that, instead of one respectable and wealthy head of a family, who could protect and assist the younger branches, giving them a good education, and putting them forwardin the world, you have half a dozen poor dispirited creatures, who have not energy or power to improve either theii' lands or themselves. Without great industry, and some capital, new lands cannot be brought into cultivation, nor can those already cleared be made very productive. 
The law alluded to might do very well in such a country as Canada for a few generations, while the new grants continued very large : but the divisions and subdivisions must, in time, become too minute, and be a check on the improvement of the country, in an agricultural point of]:  
•  i  
■«»  
-— r  QUEBEC.  
("view; and also, as a natural consequence, retard the increase of population. This division of property isextremely prejudicial to the interest not only of the landholder but also to that of the merchant,, shopkeeper, and mechanic. 
When one of the parents dies, an inventory is made of the property, and each child can immediately insist on the share of the property the law allows. The French law supposes that matrimony is a copartnership ; and that, consequently, on the death of the wife, the children have a right to demand from their father the half of his property, as heirs to their mother. If the wife's relations are not on good terms with the father, a thing that sometimes happens, they find it no difficult matter to induce the children to demand a partage, or division, which often occasions the total ruin of the father, because he loses credit, equal, at least, to his loss of property, and often to a greater extent. His powers are diminished, and his children still have a claim on him for support. One effect of this law, and not one of the least material, is, that the affection between parents and children is likely to be destroyed by it: and, in fact, it is remarked, that in this country the instances of unfeeling conduct between parents and children are extremely frequent, and a spirit of litigation is excited amongst them. One is at a loss to account for such unnatural conduct, until an acquaintance with the laws and customs of the country gives a clue to unravel the mystery. 
The law, making marriage a copartnership, and creating a community de Men, is sanctioned by the code of French law, coutume de Paris, which indeed is the text book of the Canadian lawyer; the wife being by marriage invested with a right to half the husband's property; and, being rendered independent of him, is perhaps the remote cause that the fair sex have such influence in France ; and in Canada, it is well known, that a great deal of consequence, and even an air of superiority to the husband, is assumed by them. 
British subjects coming to this country are liable to the operation of all these Canadian or French laws, in the same manner that the Canadians themselves are. — They are not always aware of this circumstance ; and it has created much disturbance in families. A man who has made a fortune here (a thing by the bye which does not very often happen), conceives that he ought, as in England, to have the disposal of it as he thinks proper. No^says the Canadian law, you have a right to onehalf only ; and if your  wife dies, her children ; or, in case you have no children, her nearest relations may oblige you to make a partage, and give them half your property, were it 100,000 guineas, and they the most worthless wretches in existence. Nothing can prevent this but an antinuptial contract of marriage, barring the communite de Men. 
7. Winter. — A Canadian winter is truly a subject of curiosity to the natives of Britain, or of any of the s. countries of Europe. It presents a view of nature perfectly new, and a variety of phenomena so highly interesting, that they cannot fail to arrest the attention of any one at all conversant in natural philosophy. 
In Canada there cannot well be said to be more than two seasons of the year, summer and winter. The earth hath scarcely laid aside her mantle of snow, when you begin to feel the force of summer heat ; and although the weather in September is mild and pleasant, it partakes more of the summer than of the autumn of temperate climates. The season of vegetation seems kindly prolonged, till surprised in a manner at once by the return of winter, without much of what may be called autumn weather. 
Frost is felt in October, but the sun still retains enough of power to make the weather, during the day, tolerably Avarm. During the month of November the frost becomes daily more severe, and snow begins to fall. Your house is now put upon the winter establishment ; stoves are put up in your rooms, and in your passages ; the windows are well secured and made tight ; and you lay aside your summer dress, and adopt flannels and furs. One snow storm now succeeds another, till the whole face of the country is covered. The eye in vain looks for a bit of ground to rest upon, the trees alone remain visible, the chilling grasp of winter is every where felt, and every precaution is taken to resist its effects. 
There is something very awful and terrific in a Canadian snow storm. A heavy fall of snow is generally accompanied by a violent gale of wind, which driving along the snow with immense velocity, and forming a thousand eddies and turnings, according to the inequalities of the surface, and resistance consequent thereon, you are able to form an idea of the velocity of the Avind : it becomes, as it were, visible. The most severe snow storms they experience in Canada, come from the n. e., the frozen regions of Hudson's Bay and Labrador. 
During summer the woods of Canada abound with birds of a great variety of sorts and sizes ;]  

QUEBEC.  
[partridges, woodcocks, pigeons, and singing birds without number. The lakes and rivers abound with aquatic birds, such as ducks, geese, snipes, &c. Some of these pass the whole summer in Canada ; others, such as the pigeons, are only found at certain seasons, as they pass from the s. to the more n. parts of the American continent, and vice versa. No sooner does the frost set in, than almost all the feathered tribes take the alarm, and leave the country ; even the hardy crow is obliged to take himself off. A species of partridge, called the pine partridge, (from its living on certain parts of the pinetree, of which it tastes very strongly), alone remains ; but it is very rarely seen, few quadrupeds are to be seen ; some hares are found, but to see them is difficult, for they have changed their colour to as pure a white as the snow in which they lie ; a kind precaution in nature to conceal them from their enemies. Many other quadrupeds, no doubt, remain in this country during the winter. Like the bear, they probably do not change their lodgings while the snow is on the ground, but remain stationary, and in a torpid state. 
The Canadians change their appearance as much as a complete change of dress can do. The hat and bonnet rouge are laid aside, and they use fur caps, fur cloaks, fur gloves, and worsted hose, over, as well as under boots. Thus defended, they venture with impunity into the severest frost. 
The snow soon covers the ground to the depth of several feet, and wheel carriages can no longer be used : the wheels would sink so deep, that it would be impossible to advance a step. In place, therefore, of wheel carriages, a sort of sledge is used, which in Canada is called a cariole. It passes over the snow without sinking deep. It is placed oil what they call runners, which resemble in form, the irons of a pair of skaits, and rise up in front in the same manner, and for the same purposes. The cariole is generally from nine to 12 inches above the snow. Some, called high runners, are about 18 inches. The body of the cariole varies in shape, according to the fancy of the owner. It is sometimes like the body of a phaeton, sometimes like a chair or gig, sometimes like a visa-vis, and sometimes like a family coach or chariot. The cariole, in short, is the name for all sorts of vehicles used in winter, from a market cart, up to a state coach. 
The generality of them are light open carriages, drawn by one horse. The snow, after being trodden on for some time, becomes compact enough to _ bear the horse, and gives very vol. iv.  little resistance to the cariole. formed in the snow by the carioles, the Canadians call cahots (from the French word cahoter, to jolt), and they certainly are very well named for you are jolted as if you crossed a field with very deep furrows and high narrow ridges. The motion is not unlike rowing in a boat against a headsea : a thing that requires to be only once tried to be disliked. 
As no other sort of carriage can, however be used in this country, custom and example reconcile one to it : all ranks use them, of one sort or other. Sometimes you see them conveying a dashing buck up one street and down another at a gallop, to the no small annoyance of people who are fond of keeping their bones whole, a thing those gentlemen seem very careless about. Sometimes you see the close covered family ones, conveying an old lady quietly and steadily to church, or to have a little gossipping with a friend ; and sometimes you see them coming in from the country conveying beef and mutton, turkies and geese, for the supply of the market. 
When the navigation of the St. Lawrence becomes impracticable, little business is done by the merchants, who then appropriate a considerable part of their time to amusements. It is necessary to do something to give a little variety to the sameness of a six months' winter. They have parties of pleasure in town, and parties of pleasure in the country, in which you have dancing, music, and the social enjoyments of conviviality. 
There is a public assembly once a fortnight, which is very well attended. If you are fond of dancing, you have an opportunity of indulging in it ; if you like a sober rubber, you find good whist players. The civil and military gentlemen mix very cordially together. Such of the Canadians as can afford it, and have an inclination, join in the amusements that are going forward, particularly the assemblies and dancing parties ; and, indeed, they are an acquisition, as many of the ladies want neither beauty nor the accomplishments necessary for their gracing aa assembly. 
One should naturally suppose that very bad consequences would be likely to arise from beingheated by dancing in so cold a climate. This, however, is not the case : both the ladies and gentlemen in the coldest weather, are dressed in the assemblyroom as thinly as they are in England in summer ; and the rooms are very comfortable, being kept moderately warm by a stove. Immediately after dancing, and while very warm,]

[the company go into the open air in the middle of the night while the cold is extreme (from 20° to SO below the freezing point), without next day feeling the least inconvenience. It is true, they take every precaution necessary, by clothing themselves very warmly. 
People are less liable to suffer from cold in Canada than they are in England, notwithstanding the greater severity of the weather. Many reasons are assigned for this fact. The Canadians take care not to expose themselves to the external air without being warmly clothed ; particular attention is paid to keeping the feet, the hands, and the head warm. 
The air is extremely dry in winter, being deprived of its moisture by congelation ; the intense frost causes naturally a deposition of the aqueous particles, in the shape of hoar frost. Now, it has been accurately ascertained and proved by experiments, that cold dry air is not so good a conductor of heat from our bodies as cold moist air; it follows, therefore, that the thermometer may shew a very low temperature in cold dry air, such as we have here, without our being sensible of a great degree of cold ; and, that in cold moist air, such as you have in England, the thermometer may not be under the freezing point, and yet the quantity of caloric or heat carried off from your body, be greater than if the thermometer shewed a temperature many degrees below freezing. Were the effect of the Cold here on one's feelings, to increase in proportion as the thermometer falls, and go as far beyond what it is in England, as the real quantum of caloric in the atmosphere is more there than here, it would be impossible to exist in this country ; but the evil carries its cure along with it, the frost deprives the air of its moisture, and consequently decreases its power of carrying off from our body the heat it contains. If we wish to know how the weather is to affect us, we should consult a hygrometer as well as a thermometer. 
When the cold dry air of this country enters your apartment, and is warmed by the heat of the stove, its drying power becomes very great. To be convinced that this is the case, it is only necessary to observe how much the furniture of the house suffers from it. The very pannels of the doors shrink so much as almost to fall out of the frame, and the frame itself shrinks to such a degree that the bolt loses its hold. 
An Englishman can with difficulty form an idea of the cold of Canada, or of its effects, till he feels and sees them. The coldest weather is  generally during the month of January. The" medium temperature in December and January is about 22 degrees below freezing. About the beginning of December all the small rivers are frozen so completely, and covered with snow, that bridges for passing them are no longer necessary, and very little attention is paid to keeping in the summer roads. Where they are hollow, or where there are fences, the roads are so completely filled up with snow, that they are on a level with the fields on each side. 
The country people, who first form the winter roads on the snow, direct their carioles by the nearest course where the snow is most level ; and they go in as straight a line as possible, to the place to which they are destined. They put up branches of trees on each side the new track, as a direction to others who wish to go that way. These they call des balises, or beacons. When they can conveniently follow the course or bed of a river, it is generally done, because the surface is evener than over the fields, and there is less on them, as they do not freeze till after a considerable quantity of snow has fallen on the fields. 
Even the great river St. Lawrence is arrested in its course. It freezes completely over a few leagues above Quebec, and serves occasionally as a road to Montreal. It seldom freezes over, opposite to Quebec, or in the bason. As the river narrows here, the current is increased, and the tide sets up and down with such force, that it generally keeps the floating masses of ice in motion. When the river freezes over opposite to Quebec, it is called, in the language of the country, a pont, because it answers the B purposeofabridge to the people who live below Quebec, and who then bring up provisions and firewood in great quantities. 
A variety of circumstances must combine to form a pont: when many very large masses oi ice happen to come in contact, and fill the whole space between one side of the river and the other, they become stationary. If this happens at neap tides, and in calm weather, the frosl fixes the whole, and it becomes a solid mass before the rising tides derange it ; when it has stood a few days, it generally acquires strength enougr to resist every impulse it may receive, till the Warmth of the April sun affects it. All these circumstances so seldom happen at the sametim* that it is about once in 10 years that the rivei takes opposite to Quebec. When such, however is the Case, you see, for the distance of eighi miles, an immense sheet of ice, as smooth as a_  

QUEBEC.  
[mirror. Thousands of people crowd upon it every day, and booths are erected for their entertainment. In one quarter, you see numbers of people enjoying the amusement of skaiting ; in another, you see carioles driving in different directions ; for the ice is so strong, that horses go on it with the greatest safety. Sometimes you see cariole races : they go over the ice with great swiftness. In short, when the pont takes (as they term it), it occasions a kind of jubilee in Quebec. 
In one point of view, it is a subject of real rejoicing to the city ; it is accompanied with substantial advantages. Provisions of all kinds, and firewood, a no less necessary article in this country, fall in price, from an increase in quantity, as soon as the pont enables the people in the country, below Quebec, to bring their surplus stock to market, in their carioles, without the expense and risk of passing the river in canoes. These canoes are not such as are used in the n. w. trade. They are one solid piece of wood, the trunk of a large tree scooped out, and formed in the outside something like a boat; some of them are very large, carrying easily 15 or 20 people. 
The passing of the St. Lawrence in canoes, in the middle of winter, is a very extraordinary operation. The time of high water is chosen, when the large masses of ice are almost stationary. The canoe is launched into the water, where there is an opening : the people are provided with ropes, boathooks, and paddles. When they come to a sheet of ice, they jump out of the canoe upon it ; draw the canoe up after them ; push it to the other side of the sheet of ice ; launch it into the water ; paddle till they come to another sheet of ice ; again haul up the canoe, cross the ice, and again launch— and so on till they reach the other side. You see 20 to 30 canoes crossing in this way at the same time ; and you cannot help trembling for them, when you see two immense masses of ice coming together, and they between, apparently in the greatest danger of being crushed to pieces ; but the people extricate themselves with great dexterity. Custom has taught them to avoid the danger which seems to threaten them with destruction : they dexterously jump upon the first piece of ice with which they come in contact, and haul the canoe after them. 
8. Travelling in that season.— In travelling in Canada during the winter, you must wrap yourself up in various vestments. In addition to the usual number of coats and waistcoats, it is neces-  sary to have a very large double cloak, a large fur cap, and fur tippet; and, what will add greatly to your comfort and defence against the cold wind, a very large muff, in which you will be often obliged to bury your face when the wind blows keen ; for you will recollect, that as the cariole is an open carriage, it affords no defence from the cold. With all the clothing and coverings you can put on, still you can with difficulty keep yourself warm. 
When a journey of any extent is to be made, a cariole must be used : but if you wish to deviate from the public beaten track, or to go into the woods, or cross fields, either from necessity or for amusement, you must use what are called snowshoes. They are made of a kind of network, fixed on a frame, shaped like a boy's paper kite ; they are about two feet long, and 18 inches broad, and therefore take in so much of the surface of the snow, that you sink but a very few inches. The military, in Canada, are all provided with snow shoes, and are out on them, that it may be no novelty in case of their taking the field in winter. For the same reason they are sometimes encamped amongst the snow. 
You can take a great deal of exercise in winter, without being fatigued, and can walk with ease and agility under a load of waistcoats and coats, under which you would sink in summer. The winter travelling in Canada is sometimes very expeditious. It is surprising with what speed a good Canadian horse will travel, drawing a cariole over the ice. There have been instances of a single horse having drawn a cariole, 'with two people in it, no less than 90 miles in 12 hours; which is more than the English mailcoach rate, with all their changes. When this happens, the roads must be very smooth and hard, which is generally the case when a severe frost has succeeded a thaw. 
The Canadian horse is a remarkably hardy animal : his best pace is a trot. He is accustomed to a great deal of bad usage and hard work, and he is the most willing creature in the world (as the jockeys term it), for he never refuses the draught. You will see them brought from the country into Quebec, in the coldest  weather, and left standing in the open air without covering, for hours together, owners are transacting their business,  while their or drinking in a publichouse ; and they seem not to be the worse for it. In the winter time the Canadian horse, like all the other quadrupeds of the country, acquires an increased quantity of fur] k l 2  v-»- ■

[to protect him from the cold ; and the Canadians never use the currying comb. 
The great difference, in point of beauty, between the winter and summer scenery is most striking. Instead of the fine variety, which, in summer, presented itself, in tracing the course of the river, — the gaiety, the liveliness of the moving waters, and passing vessels — the fine tints of the forest, and of the cornfield — the labourer employed in the business of the farm — every surrounding object reflected from the surface of the river ; nothing now is to be seen but one continued solid plain — one indiscriminate field of snow; — no rivers — no waters — no ships — not an animal in view, man nor beast, except now and then a muffledup traveller, hurrying along, as if anxious to get to a place of shelter. Which way soever you direct your attention, nothing presents itself to your observation but ice and snow ; so that you may suppose there can be very little variety in a winter journey. After the first day, your curiosity is perfectly satisfied. 
The country people pass their time in winter very idly. Their only care seems to be to keep themselves warm ; and their principal occupation is cutting and bringing home firewood. They make a journey to Quebec or Montreal occasionally, to dispose of any surplus provisions they may have, and procure some of the comforts of life ; such as replenishing their rum bottle, and renewing their stock of snuff, pipes, and tobacco. Those who live on the banks of the St. Lawrence, where the tide ebbs and flows, occupy themselves occasionally in fishing, or catching a species of fish, which come up the river in the winter time in great abundance, and form a seasonable supply for those who will take the trouble to attend to it. These fish are from four to nine inches long, and resemble a cod in every respect, except size. The Canadians call them petite morue; the English call them Tommycod. Some people think that it is a different fish from the cod, since they are found full of spawn ; which, it is alleged, could not be the case with cod at so early an age, and so small a size. It is not, we believe, ascertained at what age or size the codfish begins to propagate ; and we have yet to learn why this may not take place when the fish is six inches long, as well as when it is a foot, or two or three feet, long. If size were the criterion, is it not as extraordinary that a fish, which grows to the length of three or four feet, should propagate when at the length of one foot, as that it should do so at the length of six inches.  
The manner of catching these fish is to cut holes in the ice, and put down either nets or lines. Between Quebec and Three Rivers im* mense quantities are taken. They are easily preserved without salt ; the frost answers the purpose ; and you may see them piled upon the ice in large quantities, all frozen. It is a remarkable thing, that the Canadian horses eat them. One can scarcely help smiling at the idea of a horse eating fish, but such, we are assured by travellers, is indisputably the fact. 
Great quantities of these fish are caught at Quebec, with lines. The manner of doing so is odd enough : a hole is dug in the ice, and a temporary house is built over it, large enough to hold half a dozen people, and a stove to keep them warm. Those who cannot afford to purchase deals to make a house, substitute large pieces of ice, with which they form a kind of defence from the weather. The middle of the night is the best time for fishing. They place a strong light near the hole, which attracts the attention of the fish, and brings them round the hole in large quantities ; so that they are caught as fast as they can be pulled in. These houses are erected on the river St. Charles, in great numbers, and have a curious appearance in a dark night, particularly those made of ice, the transparency of which gives them the effect of so many lanterns. 
It is a singular fact, that these fish, if not bruised, will, when put into cold water, several days after they are caught, return to life, and swim about as well as ever. At the time they are caught they are thrown into a basket, and in the course of a minute or two they become frozen stiff. When carried home, and put into cold water, they become thawed, and begin to swim. How long they would continue out of the water in the frozen state, and afterwards shew signs of life, we cannot determine ; but some that have been taken, and been in a frozen state for eight days, when put into water, have not been found to recover, or shew any signs of life. 
In all countries, people pass their leisure hours pretty much alike ; that is, they dedicate them to amusement. In Canada, as most of their winter hours are leisure hours, there is, of course, some ingenuity necessary to give such variety to their amusements as may prevent them from becoming insipid by frequent repetition. Hence, in Quebec and Montreal, to the regular town parties, are added, irregular country parties. Picnic feasts, where every one carries with him a readydressed dish, are very common ;]  

==[[Ouebeg|OUEBEG]]==,  [and as the place of rendezvous is generally a few miles out of town, the ladies and gentlemen have the pleasure of a little carioling before dinner; the roads, it is true, are often abominably bad, being a constant succession of cahots, in which you are jolted most unmercifully ; not to say any thing of carioles being very frequently upset, and their contents, ladies, gentlemen, soup, poultry, or roast beef, tumbled into the snow, to the no small amusement of the rest of the party. It is also any thing but excessively pleasant ; after having dined, danced, supped, and passed the evening in festive glee, enlivened by the song and the catch, to drive home in the middle of the night, let the wind blow, and the snow drift, as much as they please. Besides, there sometimes come on such dreadful storms, that neither man nor horse can shew their face to them. The consequence is, the party remain all night ; the fiddlers again strike up the merry dance, and the whist players again cut for partners. Daylight comes at last, and enables the party to take the road homeward without the danger of losing their way, which most probably would have been the case with some of them, had they attempted it in the course of the night. The little hardships, disasters, or inconveniences of these country parties, give a zest, however, to the more elegant amusements of the town. 
A stranger in Canada, who has had a respectable introduction, is well received. 
The difficulties attending a winter's journey from Quebec to the United States, are most striking. Mr. Gray, (to whom we are indebted for most of the information contained in this article), thus describes it : 
" I procured one of the Yankie sleighs, as they are usually termed, and left Montreal in a very cold, hazy morning. Our first stage was from Montreal cross the St. Lawrence to Laprairie, a distance of about nine miles. After travelling about two hours on the river, we began to think it was more than time to reach the other side. We continued our course for half an hour more ; still no appearance of the place of our destination. In fact, we had lost our way. The weather was so thick and hazy, we could see but a very short space, and our driver had struck into a wrong track. There were a variety of tracks on the river, formed by the people coming from different parts of the opposite side, with firewood, &c. for Montreal. Indeed, I reckoned from two to 300 sleighs on that part of the river alone, all directing their course to Montreal.  
" On inquiring of some of these people, we found that instead of crossing the river we had taken a direction upwards, and were very near the rapids, a little below a part of the country inhabited by a tribe called the Caghnawaga Indians, at a considerable distance from Montreal. We had to retrace our steps ; and, in about two hours more, we arrived at Laprairie. 
" This circumstance is trifling in itself; I mention it merely to shew you the liability to go astray, when travelling over a level surface of snow. You can hardly imagine any thing more easy than to cross from one side of a river to another, over a track which we had been accustomed to look at every day, and yet, we went a considerable way out of our road, in a very short space of time. It was a good lesson for us, as we had to go on Lake Champlain ; where once lost ourselves, it might be long enough be fore we again found out the right road. 
" After leaving Laprairie, we very soon got into a primeval forest, through which a road has been cut as far as the American boundary line ; and it is continued onwards to Lake Champlain. This is the principal communication in" this dis  trict, between Canada and  
United  
For many miles the country is very level, and completely covered with large timber, principally pines. I saw no cross roads, so that it is a kind of pass, that might be defended with very few men. 
" The vicinity of Montreal to the United States, encourages the soldiers occasionally to desert, by the road we passed ; to prevent which, a few invalids are stationed in the wood ; they live in loghouses, not the most comfortably in the world. There is another road by way of St. John's, but the deserters avoid it, on account of the garrison or fort. As we approached the American boundary, we found a few settlements, what the Americans call a pitch. They cut down some trees, make a loghouse, sow some corn ; next year they cut down more trees, and sow more corn, and so on, till they produce something in the style of a farm. Instead of cutting down the trees, the Americans very frequently ring them, as they term it, which is cutting a section of the bark quite round : soon after which the tree decays. We saw several potash manufactories as we approached the lake, and the woods are continued close to the water. We found near the lake a kind of publichoUse, where we stopped during the night. 
" Next morning we could not proceed, because, during the whole night it had blown very]   2«2  

QUEBEC.  
[fresh, accompanied with a heavy fill of snow, which continued till near midday ; and as every track on the lake was covered, we could not venture to go upon it, our conductor not being well acquainted with the different bearings of the land marks.  
« The lake,  though 120 miles  
Ions  ,is not broad, seldom, above 10 or 15 miles ; and there are a great many islands and headlands, which direct the course of the pilot in summer, and the cariole or sleigh driver in winter. . " So soon as the weather moderated, we set out on the lake; and took a guide for some time, till we should fall in with some one going our way, or discover a track in the snow to direct us. 
" Travelling on Lake Champlain, is, at all times, really dangerous ; and I would not advise any one to attempt it, if it can be avoided ; which may generally be done by lengthening the route. Instead of going on the lake to Burlington, or Skeensboro, you may go by way of St. John's, Windmillpoint, and Sandbar, to Burlington, and from thence to Skeensboro. 
" It is very common, for sleigh, horses, and men, to fall through the ice, where the water is some hundred feet deep ; and you have no warning of your danger till the horses drop in, pulling the sleigh after them ; luckily, the weak places are of no great extent; you extricate yourself from the sleigh as quickly as possible, and you find the ice generally strong enough to support you, though it would not bear the weight of the horses. You instantly lend your aid in pulling out the horses, and in endeavouring to save them, which is done in a manner perfectly unique, and which will require the greatest stretch of your faith in my veracity, to believe — the horses are strangled, to save their lives. 
" When the horses fall through the ice (there are almost always two in an American sleigh), the struggles and exertions they make, serve only to injure and sink them ; for, that they should get out of themselves, is, from the nature of the thing, perfectly impossible. When horses go on the lake, they always have round their necks a rope, with a running noose. I observed that our horses had each of them such a rope ; and, on inquiry, found out for what purpose it was intended. The moment the ice breaks, and the horses sink into the water, the driver, and those in the sleigh, get out, and catching hold of the ropes, pull them with all their force, which, in a very few seconds, strangles the horses » and no sooner does this happen, than they rise in the  water, float on one side, are drawn out on strong ice, the noose of the rope is loosened, and respiration recommences ; in a few minutes the horses are on their feet, as much alive as ever. This operation has been known to be performed two or three times a day, on the same horses ; for, when the spring advances, the weak places in the lake become very numerous, and the people, whose business leads them often on it, frequently meet with accidents. They tell you, that horses which are often on the lake, get so accustomed to being hanged, that they think nothing at all of it. 
" Though this manner of saving horses, and getting them out of the water, appears extraordinary, yet the thing is very common, and known to every one who has been accustomed to travel on the lakes and rivers of this country, during winter. The attempt, however, does not always succeed. It sometimes happens, that both sleigh and horses go the bottom ; and the men too, if they cannot extricate themselves in time. There was an instance of it on Lake Champlain, a few days before I crossed it. u These weak places of the ice, which prove so treacherous, have been later in freezing than the surrounding ice. In all lakes, and large bodies of fresh water, there are some places which never freeze ; and some which freeze much later than others. It is to be accounted for, probably, in this way : the great body of the water is of a higher temperature than the atmosphere, although the surface has been cooled down below the freezing point, and become ice. The water is constantly giving out its heat to the atmosphere, at some particular place, which thereby is kept from freezing for a considerable time ; by and by, when the frost becomes very intense, that place at length freezes, but does not acquire the strength necessary to support the horses. 
3 There is another source of danger to the traveller on the lakes, which it is difficult to account for : viz. large cracks or openings, which run from one side of the lake to the other ; some of them six feet broad at least. I had not proceeded many miles on the lake before I met with a crack ; but, instead of an opening, I found that at this place the ice had shelved up to the height of several feet ; and I learned that this was an indication of there being an opening further on. At the distance of eight or 10 miles from this place, I was surprised to observe the driver put his horses to their full speed: I could see no cause for it. In a few minutes, however, I saw]  i*m  m  

QUEBEC.  
[the crack, of opening, about five feet broad: we were at it in a moment ; it was impossible to check the horses, or to stop and consider of the practicability of passing, or of the consequences; the driver, without consulting any one, had made up his mind on the subject, — the horses took the leap, and cleared the opening, carrying the sleigh and its contents with them. The concussion on the opposite side was so great, however, that the runners of the sleigh were broken, and there was a great chance of our being thrown, by the violence of the concussion, out of the sleigh, into the gulf we had crossed : this had very nearly taken place ; but I was fortunate enough to regain my seat. By the help of some cords we repaired our damage, and proceeded on our journey. We met with several other cracks, but as they were not in general above a foot or two in breadth, we passed them, without fear or accident. When the ice is cleared of snow, which was frequently the case, I could see that it was about a foot in thickness ; yet it made a crackling noise as we went along, and seemed to give to the weight of the sleigh and horses, as we advanced, which produced sensations not very pleasant. 
" There are a great many islands in Lake Champlain, which are generally inhabited ; you find inns on them, too, where you can get provisions and beds, if necessary." 
9. Provisions not dearer during that season. — The severity of the cold, in this country, has its advantages as well as disadvantages. The quantity of snow with which the ground is covered, renders it necessary for the farmer to house all his cattle and sheep, and to put his hay, straw, and corn, under cover. So soon as the ground is covered, and the frost completely set in, the cattle and sheep, which are destined for winter use, are killed ; and also poultry of all kinds, before they have lost any of the fat they had acquired during the summer and autumn. Little or no salt is necessary to preserve them : they only require to be exposed to the frost for a short time, and they become as hard as ice. When in this state, the poultry, and indeed the beef and mutton too, are packed in casks or boxes amongst snow, and at the end of four or five months are still perfectly sound and good. Frozen meat is thawed by keeping it in cold water about twelve hours — warm water would render it useless. After the meat is hard frozen, the principal thing to be attended to, is to preserve it from the external air, when the temperature is above the freezing point, which is fre-  quently the case in March and April. Snow being a good nonconductor of heat, answers this purpose : blankets, too, are frequently used. The frost not only preserves beef, mutton, and poultry, but also fish, so long as you ean keep it in a temperature below freezing. The fish market, during winter, is pretty well supplied, owing, not a little, to the great industry of the people of the United States, who come even from Boston to Montreal, a distance of 420 miles. 
Provisions of all kinds are more plentiful, and consequently cheaper, in winter than in summer. The market is supplied from a greater extent of country. The lakes and rivers being frozen, and the people without work, they bring to market all sorts of meat and poultry, from a great distance. Being hard frozen, it can be stowed in their carioles without receiving the least injury from the great length of carriage. 
Good beef and mutton are then sold at from 3d. to4d. per lb.; good fat fowls at 20d. to 2s. per couple ; turkeys 2s. to 2s. 6d. each ; geese and ducks in proportion : so that the expense of housekeeping, in these articles, is not great in winter. In summer, as meat is supplied in the towns by the town butchers alone, the price advances considerably. The great heat of summer renders it impossible to bring meat from any considerable distance. 
It is a fortunate thing for the people in the towns of Canada, that provisions are cheaper in winter than in summer ; for the winter subjects them to a heavy expense for firewood, which is as you may well believe, a sine qua non in this climate. 
The expense of fuel to a family in Quebec or Montreal, is fully equal to what the same family would require in London ; and it is to be regretted, that there is no prospect of its becoming cheaper. On the contrary, in proportion as the woods are cut, and the distance of carriage increased, the price is augmented ; so that in time it will be cheaper to import coals than purchase wood. Firewood is generally laid in during the summer. It is brought to Quebec and Montreal on the river, in immense rafts. The wood is cut into junks, and piled upon a float subdivided into compartments of a certain size, containing so many cords. In winter, it is brought from the country in sleighs, and sold at so much per cord, or per sleigh load. No coal has yet been found in Canada ; probably, because it has never been thought worth searching after. It is supposed that coal exists in the neighbourhood]   QUEBEC.  
[of Quebec ; at any rate, there can be no doubt that it exists in great abundance in the island of Cape Breton, which may one day become the Newcastle of Canada. 
At present, coals are to be purchased very cheap in Quebec. Many of the vessels from Scotland, and from the north of England, take in coals as ballast, and sell them very cheap, sometimes as low as 17s. per chaldron. Even the kennel coal, which is difficult to be be met with in many parts of England, is sold at 36s. per chaldron, which is not above half the price of Newcastle coal, in winter, in the neighbourhood of London. People who have been accustomed to burn wood, do not like to burn coal. They tell you that the smell is extremely disagreeable to them, and, besides, that coal does not answer for stoves so well as wood. This prepossession against coals, accounts for their being proportionably cheaper than wood. 
It is well, however, that they have either wood or coal, for the effects of frost in this country are with difficulty guarded against, and are often in themselves very curious. 
10. A sudden thaw. — In thus having endeavoured to afford some of the striking features of the Canadian winter, we ought not to have omitted that, during the most severe cold in January, a great and very sudden change takes place almost every year, and continues for a day or two. From a most severe frost, when the thermometer shews 60 degrees below the freezing point, it suddenly becomes so warm, that the thermometer shews three degrees above freezing. In short, the weather will sometimes change in a few hours, from nearly the greatest degree of cold that ever was known here, to a complete thaw. Such a great and sudden change is productive of very unpleasant sensations. The stoves and winter clothing are quite oppressive ; and yet, it is dangerous to dispense with either, for you, every hour, look for a return of the cold weather. Fortunately, it does not in general continue many days ; sometimes, however, it has been known to last 10 or 14 days ; and, when this is the case, it is of very serious injury to the country, in a variety of ways. It is extremely prejudicial to the health of the people. The streets are so inundated with water, from the melting of the snow, that you cannot walk out ; and the roads become so soft, and the rivers so full of water, that you cannot use a cariole, or travel, indeed, in any mode. But, what is a much more serious evil than all these things, the provisions which were destined to  serve through the winter, become thawed, and are either destroyed altogether, or greatly injured. 
It is surprising, that although this circumstance has occurred frecpjently, and the people are subject to it every year, yet there is not much attention paid to putting the provisions in such a situation, and packing them up in such a manner, as to effectually prevent their being accessible to the warm air, during the thaw. It might be done very easily : let them be packed in a tight box or cask, after being completely frozen, and this box or cask put into another, large enough to admit of its being surrounded with pounded ice and snow, which woidd act as a perfect nonconductor of heat, and preserve the contents of the inner box in their frozen state for a great length of time. The outer box should have holes in its bottom, to allow any water to run out, which might arise from the melting of the snow. This method has, we believe, been tried with success ; but it is by no means in general use. 
During the thaw, a very extraordinary effect is produced, sometimes, on the trees. The Canadians call it a verglass. The tree, from the trunk to the point of the smallest branch, becomes incrusted with pure ice. There may be a small degree of frost during the night, which will freeze the moisture that covered the trees during the day ; and, it is probable, that the external parts of the trees themselves, being cooled down below the freezing point, by the extreme cold of the previous weather, freeze the vapour the moment it comes in contact with them ; in the same way that the glass of a window in winter becomes incrusted with ice, by the freezingof the moisture in the air of a room. The branches become at last so loaded with ice, that they can with difficulty support the weight of it ; and if there happens to come a storm of wind, which is not unfrequent, the branches infallibly break off, and the destruction amongst trees of all sorts is immense. Through the effects of some of the verglass, branches of trees, from six to 12 inches in diameter, are seen every where hanging from the trees, completely broken down. We are told, that there can be nothing more curious or beautiful than one of those iceincrusted trees, when the sun shines upon it. Indeed, one can easily conceive that it must have the appearance of fairy work, or enchantment. 
1 1 . Method of warming the houses. — In Quebec the rooms are heated by stoves. The principal advantage arising from this practice, is the urn-]  

QUEBEC.  
[form heat which is kept up, so that the walls of the room become warmed, and communicate their warmth to the air which comes into the room, and gets in contact with them. In a room, the walls of which are cold, if the air is heated and rarefied, it will be cooled and condensed the moment it comes in contact with the cold walls ; and as by condensation it becomes heavier, it it will rush downwards, producing a current of air towards the floor, which will be felt by those sitting close to the wall. 
The Canadians keep their houses very hot; and they themselves, while excessively warm, go immediately into the cold air, without seeming to feel any inconvenience from it ; which would induce one to believe, that the sudden transition From a hot room into the cold air, if the person be properly clothed, were not so dangerous as is generally imagined. This is further illustrated by the instances we have already mentioned, of ladies and gentlemen going into the cold night lir, out of a warm ballroom, without suffering »ny inconvenience from it. 
We are disposed to join in the opinion of those yho think that the living in a warm room, so ar from weakening and making you delicate, as t is termed, and rendering you unfit to bear :old, is the best preservative against the bad jffects of cold, when you may be under the ne- :essity of exposing yourself to it. 
It has been observed by an eminent philosother, that if, during the time we are sitting still, lie circulation of the blood is gradually and inensibly diminished by the cold which surrounds is, it is not possible that we should be able to upport a great additional degree of cold, without inking under it. We should be like water, fhich, by exposure to moderate cold in a state >f rest, has been slowly cooled down below the reezing point ; the smallest additional cold, or a mall degree of agitation, changes it to ice in an nstant ; but water, at a high temperature, will upport the same degree of frost, for a consilerable time, without appearing to be at all affected by it. 
In Canada, the walls of the houses are usually Mastered on the outside, to preserve the stone rom moisture, and the consequent destructive (fleets of the frost. They find it, however, a very lifficult matter to get plaster to adhere ; partiularly if exposed to the c. wind, which, in •ne winter^ destroys almost any plaster they an use. A composition has lately been tried, vhich promises to answer better. About a couple »f pounds of Muscovado sugar are mixed with 

XO-L. IV„    i-.^m  a bushel of lime ; and it makes a very hard and durable mixture for rough casting. In places the most exposed to the e. wind, it has remained hard and fast, after a fair trial. 
12. Breakingup of the winter. — No part of the Canadian winter is more interesting than the conclusion of it, when the snow begins to disappear, and the ice in the rivers to break up, which is the case in the end of April. One would naturally suppose, that six months frost and snow would have become insufferably tiresome t&*3, stranger ; but this is not the case. The wthter' may be divided into three seasons as it were : for two months at the beginning the snow is falling, and the frost becoming daily more severe. The middle two months of severe frost is not without interest ; for then is to be seen winter in all his majesty, after he has bound up the lakes and rivers in fetters of ice, and covered the earth as with a mantle. The last two months are interesting, because there is then an anxiety to see by what means, and in what manner, such an immensity of snow and ice is to be got rid of. 
The influence of the sun is little felt in February. In March, however, you are sensible of its power ; and, during this month, the weather in general is very beautiful ; the frost is still sufficiently severe to keep the roads hard and good ; the sky is clear, the sun shines bright ; it is pleasant to get into a cariole, and drive a few miles into the country. During the month of April the influence of the sun has been so great, as powerfully to affect all nature. The snow has nearly disappeared about the first week in May ; the ice in the lakes and rivers is broken up by the increase of water from the melting of snow,, and it is floated down to the great river St. Lawrence, where it accumulates in immense quantities, and is carried up and down with the tide. 
At this time the St. Lawrence presents one of the most extraordinary scenes in nature. It is impossible to form an adequate idea of it without being a spectator. From bank to bank it is quite choked up with immense masses and sheets of ke ;• some of them from 400 to 500 yards in diameter. The tide forces them on one another, breaks them into smaller pieces, and raises them in shelving and fantastic forms considerably above the surface. This mass of moving ice fills the whole basin, and is seen as far up the river as your eye can reach, a distance altogether of 12 to 15 miles. 
In the fall of the year the risk of shipwreck is greatly increased, from the snowstorms, prevalent at that time. These storms not only pre-]

[vent the sailors" from seeing the coast and the landmarks, and consequently from directing their course properly ; but the cold is then so severe, that the men cannot remain exposed to it. The cordage becomes incrusted with ice, so that it cannot run through the blocks, and the sails become frozen in such a manner, that there is no possibility of working the ship; besides, so much ice gets about the rudder that it becomes immoveable. Many vessels have been lost from these circumstances, and almost every winter, some vessels sail in expectation of getting out of the river; but, being caught in a snow storm, are very fortunate if they escape destruction, by getting into some bay or place of shelter, where they remain fixed for the winter. 
No sooner is the influence of the April sun felt, than you see birds of various kinds returning to their summer quarters ; and vegetation, about the 10th of May, is very strong. The snow is nearly gone, and the frost is sufficiently out of the ground to allow the farmer to commence his operations. This takes place after the snow is gone, sooner than one would imagine. The frost does not penetrate so deep into the ground, as from the intenseness and long continuance of the cold might be expected. 
In countries where you have six months frost, were the soil exposed to its influence all the while it would have penetrated so deep, that it is a question if the heat of a whole summer would eradicate it. But Providence has here furnished a remedy : it has kindly decreed, that when water is cooled down to 32° it shall freeze, and be converted into ice and snow. The rivers become covered with ice, the surface of the earth becomes hardened, snow falls to a considerable thickness, and by these means the water and the land are protected from the influence of that immense volume of cold, dense atmosphere, which presses on from the polar regions towards the s. when the sun retreats after the solstice. The natural heat of the earth is about 42° ; the thermometer stands at this point in the deepest mines that have been sunk. This natural heat, as well as the heat accumulated in the earth and water during summer, is prevented, by the ice and snow, from making its escape ; and as soon as the return of the sun has brought warmth enough to banish the frost from the atmosphere, the latent heat of the earth and water lends its aid in dissolving the snow and ice, and forwarding vegetation. Snow is peculiarly well calculated for preserving warmth in the earth ; because it is full of air, which is known to be a very bad con-  ductor of heat, and will of course the more effectually prevent its escaping from the surface. It is a thing very well ascertained here, that vegetation has made some progress under the snow, before it has deserted the ground. 
The long continuance of winter in Canada is certainly a circumstance which must retard its progress in improvement, and the increase of its trade. Some people pretend to say, that it must ever prevent its becoming a great, populous, and trading nation. We cannot go so far. We have seen Russia in the course of a century, become a great, populous, and trading nation. We have seen a splendid capital city, and many respectable towns, raised by the magical powers of commerce and domestic industry ; and yet the Russian winter is as long as the Canadian winter. The communication of the Russians, by water, with the rest of the world is cut off, and that element confounded, as it were, with the land, from the 27th of November to the 19th of April (upon an average calculation of 15 years), which is nearly five months. Now vessels sometimes leave Quebec as late as the beginning of December, and arrive sometimes in the end of April, so that the Neva is as long shut up as the St. Lawrence; yet nobody ever doubts that Russia is a rising country, and may become the most powerful in Europe. 
It is worthy of remark, and not a little surprising, that so large a river as the St. Lawrence, in lat. 47°, should be shut up with ice as soon, and continue as long shut up, as the comparatively small river, the Neva, in lat. 60°.

1. Description of the inhabitants. — The population of Quebec, according to the census of 1784, amounted to 6472 souls. The towns of Quebec and Montreal, including their suburbs, are said to contain at present about 12,000 inhabitants each, nearly threefourths of whom are French, In speaking of the society of Lower Canada, wc shall confine our remarks chiefly to the city oi Quebec, which as it is the capital, and the manners of its inhabitants are in every respect similai to those of Montreal, will serve as a general view of society among the higher orders throughoui the country. 
The British inhabitants of Quebec consist o the government people ; the military ; a few per sons belonging to the church, the law, and medi cine ; the merchants, and shopkeepers. 
The French comprise the old noblesse anc seigniors, most of whom are members of the go-  
*mm  

QUEBEC.  [vemment ; the clergy ; the advocates and notaries ; the storekeepers. 
These different classes form three distinct divisions of society, which contrive to keep at a respectable distance from each other. The first is composed of the highest orders next to the governor, comprehending the members of the government ; the honourable professions ; and a few of the principal merchants. These are admitted to the chateau. 
The second division is composed of the inferior merchants, the shopkeepers and traders ; together with the subordinate officers of the government, the army, the law, and the church ; the practitioners in medicine, and other British inhabitants. 
The third division consists of the French inhabitants, most of whom, except the few who are members of the government, associate almost entirely together, unless that a public entertainment, or the annual assemblies, bring some of them into company with the British. A very small proportion of the British Canadians were horn in the colony, and consequently very little difference in person, dress, or manners, is discernible between them and the inhabitants of the mother country. The French have also assimilated themselves so nearly to the British in dress, manners, and amusements, especially the younger branches, that if it was not for their language, there would be little to distinguish their respective coteries. 
The Creoles of Canada (or the descendants of Europeans born in Canada), both French and  
English, who inhabit the towns, are generally of a middle stature, rather slender than robust, and very rarely possess the blooming and ruddy complexion of the British ; a pale, sallow, or swarthy countenance, characterises the natives of Canada, and with few exceptions, the whole of the American continent. It is rather singular, that a foggy atmosphere should be conducive to that bloom of health which glows on the cheek of a British islander ; yet the fact is corroborated by the appearance of the inhabitants of Newfoundland, of the shores of Nova Scotia and the New  
England states  who, enveloped in fogs more  than onehalf the year, enjoy the same ruddy complexion as the English ; while those who livein the interior, under a clear sky, are universally distinguished by sallow or swarthy complexions. Lower Canada cannot boast of much superlative beauty among its females ; but there are many who possess very pleasing and interesting countenances. Montreal is allowed to have the advantage over the other towns for female beauty. The country girls, who are nearly all French (with the exception of those who reside in the back townships), are pretty when very young, but from hard work and exposure to the sun, they grow up coarse featured and swarthy, and have all the sturdiness but none of the beauty of our Welch girls. Upon the whole, if the generality of the Canadian females are not remarkable for beautiful faces or elegant figures, there is nothing in either that can offend, and both are certainly as much as the men are entitled to,, — See Canada.]  a* m 2

■  ,Souchong tea, so much used in England, is scarcely known at Quebec ; execrable bohea sells from 2s. to 3s. 6d. Teas are brought in large quantities from the United States. In 1807 the importation of that article was 42,000 lbs. ; while the importation from England was only 4500 lbs. This is occasioned by their procuring teas cheaper from the United States than from England, though they are greatly inferior in quality. 
Coffee and chocolate are drank principally by the French inhabitants. The quantity imported in 1807 was 19,598 lbs. of coffee from Great Britain and her colonies, and 8070 lbs. chocolate from the United States, where manufactories of it are established. Both these articles are of inferior quality, and are retailed upon an average at 2s. per lb. 
Manufactories of soap and candles are established at Quebec, and those articles are sold nearly at the same price as in London ; if any thing, rather higher. The countrypeople make their own soap and candles. 
Tobacco, notwithstanding it is cultivated by almost every farmer in Canada, yet is imported in large quantities both from England and the  
United States. In 1807, the following quantity was imported from those countries : 
From Great Britain and her colonies, 
Leaf Tobacco - - 151,578 lbs. 
Manufactured do. -  
1,145  
From the United States, Leaf Tobacco - - 120,747 lbs. Manufactured do. - 51,082 Snuff ..... 16,058  
152,725  
187,887  
Difference in favour of the United States 35,164  
Thus it appears, that the United States have had the advantage of Great Britain in the exportation of manufactured tobacco and snuff, to the amount of 65,995 lbs., and upon the whole article of tobacco to the amouut of 35,164 lbs. Leal tobacco sells from 9d. to Is., and the manufactured from Is. 6d. to 2s. 
Salt is procured chiefly from Liverpool. In 1807, upwards of 220,000 bushels were imported, The preceding winter there was a great scarcity of that article ; and the last ship whicharrived]  
**m  

QUEBEC.  [with it, sold her cargo at 7*. 6d. per bushel. At one time during the winter it was as high as 12s. and 14s. ; but the next spring it fell to 3s. 6d. which is generally the price at which it is retailed. Ships from Liverpool are most commonly balasted with salt ; and during the season of their arrival at Quebec, some of the merchants purchase it from Is. 3d. to Is. 8c?. per bushel, and monopolize it until the season is over, when no more supplies can be procured till the following spring.  
A considerable quantity is annually exported to the United States. The Vermontese, on the confines of Canada, depend wholly on that country for their supply of salt, as they procure it much cheaper than from the seaport towns in the New England states. These people salt large quantities of beef, pork, and butter ; a great part of which they export to Canada. More than 250,000 lbs. were received in 1807 from the United States.

The whole of the island, with the exception of one small part, is of a moderate height, and consists entirely of a wood, which is continually green. Amongst the trees which form this wood are many chesnuts : here are also abundance of birds, and particularly of parrots, parroquets ; also of stags, tigers, monkies, and alligators; and of a species of snake of a very singular kind, which they call the sierpe violante; the which darts itself down with violence from the branches of the trees upon men or animals, who may pass beneath : their bite produces instant   death ; nor has there to this time been found any antidote whatever against their poison. The sea likewise is infested with alligators, and with a very large flat fish, called manta or cloak, which envelopes and suffocates those who are diving for pearls, although some have a knack of defending and liberating themselves, by a doubleedged and sharp pointed knife. The port of this island is called Canal Bueno, and is six miles long, and 30 feet deep. 
The territory is very fertile, and would, if cultivated, produce abundantly; as it is well irrigated by streams and rivulets. In the part looking to the n. e. is a natural cascade, superior to any thing that could be formed by art. It is a river of excellent water, of about 40 feet wide, which rushes down a declivity of 150 feet. The channel into which it falls is very irregular ; as being composed of rocks and large stones, both as to its sides and bottom. These afford frequent interruptions to the course of the water, so that this is seen in many parts to move in a serpentine course, though nevertheless with great impetuosity and smoothly ; and in other parts to precipitate itself over rocks in a perpendicular fall. 
This current is surrounded by a beautiful wood, and even upon the rocks which form the channel are to be seen large trees ; so that the. winding of the water, and the varied succession of the foliage, form a prospect enchanting in itself; but rendered still more so by a variety of birds, whose plumage could vie with the colours of the rainbow. It is really to be regretted that no one has ever thought to settle in this beautiful island, with the great advantage it has of being so near to the continent. Its port, which is on the <?. side, is in long. 71° 33' 30" w. and in lat. 70° 27' 30" n.

It is a little more than a league long from n. to s., and is a quarter of a league distant from the continent : in lat. 36° 38' s. [The coast of this island is famous from the abundance of large and welltasted muscles found upon it.] 
==[[Quiriquiripas|QUIRIQUIRIPAS]]==, a barbarous and Caribee nation of Indians, who dwell s. s. e. of the river Orinoco, near the mountains to the n. w. of the province of Dorado ; bounded by the Mapoyos, the Arvacas, and Mediterranean Caribees, who keep them as it were besieged in the serranias^ and without permitting them to sally forth from their retreats, or even entering amongst them to make them prisoners, as is customary among the other nations, from the interest they have acquired from the industry of these poor miserable people, who weave hammocks from cotton, and make fine blankets. 
==[[Quiros|QUIROS]]==, a river of the province and corregimiento of Piura in Peru. It is large and abundant, rises in the mountains of Ayavaca in the e. of the province of Jaen, runs w., and, uniting itself with others, enters the Catamayu or Colan : its mouth is in lat. 4° 33' 21" 5. 
==[[Quirotoa|QUIROTOA]]==, a large lake of the kingdom of Quito ; in the middle of which burst forth a volcano in 1739, and again in 1743. Its waters are sulphureous and bituminous. 
==[[Quirpon|QUIRPON]]==, an island of the N. Sea, near the e. coast of Newfoundland ; at the entrance of the strait of Belle-Isle. 
==[[Quirrulas|QUIRRULAS]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada : they dwell to the s. of the capital of Santa Fe in the vicinity of the river Orinoco : bounded e. by the country of the Maipures ; and live scattered amongst those woods like wild beasts, maintaining themselves by the chace and fishing. They go entirely naked, and paint their bodies of different colours. 
==[[Quirue|QUIRUE]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Porco in Peru; distant 18 leagues from the town of Potosi. 
==[[Quisahuara|QUISAHUARA]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Castro- Virreyna in Peru, annexed to the curacy of the settlement of Cordoba. 
==[[Quisapincha|QUISAPINCHA]]==, a settlement of the asiento and jurisdiction of Ambato and corregimiento of Riobamba in the kingdom of Quito. In its district is a large estate called Chulapu. 
==[[Quiseo|QUISEO]]==, a settlement of the head settlement of the district and alcaldia mayor of La Barca in   the kingdom of Nueva Galicia : it is close to its capital to the w. 
==[[Quishuares|QUISHUARES]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Quispicanchi in Peru, called thus from the abundance of some shrubs of this name found in its district. 
==[[Quismes|QUISMES]]==, a settlement of the province and government of Buenos Ayres ; situate e. of the capital, and on the shore of the river Plata. 
==[[Quisopango|QUISOPANGO]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Caxamarquilla in Peru. 
==[[Quispicanchi|QUISPICANCHI]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru : bounded n. e. by the province of Paucartambo ; e. by the Cordillera of Vilcanota and province of Carabaya, s. w. by the province of Canes and Canches, and s., in some degree, by that of Chumbivilcas, and that of Chilques and Masques ; by the which it is also bounded on the w. Its length is 35 leagues from n. to s., and its width more than SO. Its temperature is various, and that of the valley of Oropesa, which is the most immediate to Cuzco, very mild and pleasant ; so that it has many inhabitants of distinction residing in its city. Also, its religious communities have various estates of maize, wheat, and other seeds, fruits and garden herbs, as also beautiful houses for recreation, and orchards and gardens in the said valley. Nearly all the rest of the province is cold ; but in many parts they gather wheat, maize, and other seeds ; and in the heights are various herds of large and small cattle for the supply of Cuzco, especially towards the e. part of the province, through which runs the cordillera of Vilcanota ; a terminary which divides the jurisdiction of the two audiences of Lima and Charcas. 
In the lastmentioned part of the cordillera stands the mountain called Andes de Cuchoa, from which runs a large river named Araza, which, growing larger afterwards, penetrates the mountains of the infidel Indians, and, joining others, empties itself, after running more than 150 leagues, into the Maranon. 
In a mountain called Camanti, near this river, is a gold mine, and in those precints are various estates of cocoa, where they gather also plantains, pine?, papajas, lemons, pomegranates, and various other wild fruits ; and in the mountains are found many venomous reptiles. As a defence against the irruption of the barbarian Indians, those interested in the mine keep an armed force. 
They fabricate in this province much cloth of the country, such as broad cloths, baizes, and *erges. Here are baths of warm water, which were used by the Indians, and some mines of  

QUI  gold and silver, which, although abundant formerly, are not now worked, owing to the poverty of the inhabitants. 
This province is watered by two considerable rivers, which yield some fish ; as also by some streams ; the one of these rivers is the Huatavay, which passes through Cuzco, and from thence proceeds in a very large body, and empties itself into the Vilcamayo, which runs by the n. to the province of Calca and Lares, and enters that of Canes and Canches : the other river is called Rimac, and passes through the extremity of the province by the s. w. There is another, also, formed of two lakes which are in Vilcanota, and which enters the province of Caxatambo. 
At half a league from the settlement of Oropesa, in the n. part, is a lake, which they call Mohima, of more than half a league long, and a quarter wide, in which grows quantities of t ushes, and in which are some fish and water fowl. A point of this lake is just at the foot of a mountain called Rumicolca ; where there are to be seen the ruins of the palace of the Inca Huascar. There is a tradition that, in the centre of this mountain are hidden the immense riches of the eleven Emperors ; and in the endeavour to find the same, very large fortunes have been spent in vain ; nothing having been discovered but some caves and holes, called chinganas, in the interior of the mountains, and certain channels for conveying the water. 
From the year 1715 till 1718, many shocks of earthquakes were felt, and continued to be felt till 1723 in Quiquijana and Urcos. Close to the settlement of Urcos is the lake into which has been said to be thrown that great chain of gold made at the birth of Huascar, and which so many have with useless diligence searched for. It is presumed that this lake is formed artificially by aqueducts, by which it is regularly emptied and filled ; since, subsequent to the conquest, it has always maintained itself at one particular height. It is not more than 500 yards in length, and 300 in width, and its depth in the centre is 56. There are in this province, besides this, some other small lakes, and a large one called Pomacanchi, of three leagues long and more than one wide. 
In the s. part are some saline earths, by which a commerce is carried on with the other provinces; also here is a mountain of loadstone. The rivers, which intersect the high road to Potosi, Chuquisaca, and other settlements of the sierra, are passed by bridges of hurdles. The capital is the settlement of Urcos, and the inhabitants of the  
~-~*  Q U I    province amount to 7200 ; and before the plague of 1720, amounted to 30,000 ; this dimininution having also equally prevailed in the other provinces of the sierra. The corregidor had a repartimiento of 146,350 dollars ; and it paid an alcavala of 1170 annually. The other settlements are,

It is 45 miles long, in lat. 14° 20' n. Long. 81° w. Quita-Sueno, another shoal of isles and rocks, near the e. coast of the province and government of Yucatan ; opposite the Bay of Espiritu Santo.

Hernan Cortes tarried here the night before he, for the first time, entered into Mexico ; and here he was, together with his army, most hospitably entertained by the cazique of the place. 
==[[Quitlaguze|QUITLAGUZE]]==, a settlement of the alcaldia mayor and jurisdiction of Chalco in Nueva Espana, where there is a floodgate and wall, which divides the lake. 
==[[Quito|QUITO]]==, a kingdom of S. America, subject to the jurisdiction of the viceroy of Santa Fe, by which it is bounded on the n. on the shores of the river Negro ; bounded also s. by the province and corregimiento of Piura and Chachapoyas of Peru ; w. by the strands of Machala of the S. Sea, and e. by the river Maranon, until it touches the line or meridian of demarcation of the Portuguese dominions. It is in length 400 leagues from n. to s., and 600 in width from e. to w. This kingdom was conquered by Inca Tupac Yupanqui, the army being commanded by Prince Huaynacapac, with whose consent that emperor ceded it to his own son Atahualpa, on condition that he married one of the daughters of the last king of Quito ; in whose time it was discovered by Pizarro, and was ultimately conquered by Sebastian de Belalcazar. 
It enjoys different climates, although for the most part of a mild and benign temperature. But in the deserts and mountains of the cordillera, which are the loftiest in the whole world, and which are continually covered with snow, the cold is most intense. It is situate below the equinoctial line ; and for this reason, the days are equal with the nights the whole year round, the season being that of a constant summer, as the trees are always covered with leaves and fruits, and it thus being known through the whole of Peru by the name of siempre verde Quito (ever green Quito.) 
It is fertile and abundant in every kind of vegetable production, as well those known in both the Americas as those of Europe, and to such a degree that, as we are informed by a celebrated author, they never need cultivation. Here are infinite breeds of cattle of all classes, and of their    

QUITO.  wools are made, in many workshops, large quantities of natives clothes, such as cloths, baizes, and serges, by which formerly were supplied all the provinces of Peru, and a great traffic was carried on, not to mention the trade in the linen and cotton fabrics, so fine and beautiful as to vie with the most excellent of England. It has mines of gold, silver, copper, and other metals, but these are not worked ; and the same is the case with some mines of quicksilver, rubies, amathists, emeralds, rockcrystal, and some marbles of the finest quality. 
This province is watered and fertilized by innumerable rivers, some of them extremely large, and which have neither bark nor bridge, but are passed en taravita, or by slings. All these rivers run to encrease the stream of the Maranon, and swell it to a monstrous size. 
This kingdom is governed by a president, who is governor and commandantgeneral of it, and by a tribunal of royal audience, and comprehends the provinces of Pasto, Jaen de Bracamoros, Esmeraldas, Quixos and Macas, Maihas, Mocoa, Sucumbios, Xibaros, Ibarra, Tacunga, Ambato, Riobamba, Cuenca, Loxa, Zamora, Chimbo, Alausi, and Guayaquil ; some of which are governments, and others corregimientos ; and it formerly included the provinces of Popayan, Choco, and Raposo, which were afterwards separated from it : but of all these a proper account will be found under their proper articles. In these provinces are 16 cities, four towns, two asientos, Or large populations, without this title, and 260 settlements, which include 552,800 Catholic inhabitants, not to mention an incredible multitude of barbarian Indians composed of infinite nations. It is very subject to eruptions of its volcanoes, and to frequent earthquakes,which have destroyed some cities and settlements. The natives of the country are industrious, addicted to labour, and much given to mechanical arts, in which they labour with extraordinary ingenuity. They are docile, affable, liberal, charitable, and of very acute genius. The principal trait in the character of the nobility is a love of luxury and ease, and of the Indians and Mexicans habits of inebriety.

Quito, the province and corregimiento of this name, is a part of the same kingdom, which, although it be confounded with the district of Las Cinco Leguas de la Capital, is in some degree of greater extent, and is bounded s. by the province of Tacunga. The whole of it is covered with estates, some situate in plains, others in the spacious windings of the ravines, and others in the paramos. The vegetable productions are according to the disposition of its territory. The estates in the llanos produce maize, the crops of which are very abundant, and those of the quebradas or deep ravines, where the temperature is hot, produce sugarcane, of which they make much sugar, the hard scrapings of which serve as sweetmeats for the common people ; also honey and brandy. With the fruits peculiar to this climate they make here a variety of sweetmeats, which they call rallados, and of which the consumption is very great. This cane is of very slow growth in the temperate parts of this corre-  gimiento, since,  although  there be some places  rather hot, yet they are not sufficiently so for the ripening of this fruit ; and it is, consequently, not fit to cut till three years after its plantation, nor does it even then produce more than once, and one shoot is sufficient for its regeneration. 
The estates of the paramos, or deserts, which enjoy a variety of temperatures, some colder than others, produce corn, barley, papas, and all kinds of necessary grain. In its mountain plains feed very large flocks of sheep, which with their wool furnish materials for the manufactures of this province. Others of these plains serve as pastures, wherein neat cattle breed, principally used for their milk, of which are made butter and cheese : again, other estates are com-  

QUIT O.  posed of manufacturing places, where, besides the culture of cattle and seeds, the natives attend to the making of native cloths, baizes, and serges. from what has been said, it must be clear that the temperature of this province is undeterminable, since in proportion to its height it is more or less cold, as also more or less hot ; and it is by this variety of climate that it produces a corresponding proportion of different kinds of fruits and seeds ; and thus it is, that by half a day's journey, you may leave a country, where, from the heat, you might perceive yourself to be under the torrid zone, and may enter another country where all is frost and snow : but what, in all this, is most to be wondered at, is, that no alteration, with respect to the several parts, takes place the whole year round : but that the place which is cold is always cold, and that which is hot is always hot. In the paramos alone •some change is to be perceived ; for the coldness which generally reigns there is increased by the winds, although the manner in which these paramos are affected, and what be considered the peculiar characteristic of their climate, is a dense cloud ; which almost constantly envelopes them, and which, when it happens to fall in the shape of small hail, snow, or mist, makes them so insufferably cold, as to render life precarious. With all this, however, in the parts in which there are no paramos, and where the wind is moderate, and the rays of the sun can penetrate the earth, the climate is very supportable. 
The greater part of the settlements of this corregimiento, which are in number 25, have little formality in their disposition. The church and house of the curate, which, although he be a clergyman, they call a convent, from having been at its origin under the charge of some religious, is the principal building here ; and all those of the othel* settlements are reduced to hovels of mud, covered with straw, and scattered amongst the fields, where every native has his chacarita, or piece of land, which he cultivates himself. The inhabitants of this province are, for the most part, composed of Indians, who dwell in many of the settlements, when they are not tributary ; but there are also here some Mustee inhabitants, in some parts even exceeding the former ; nor are there wanting amongst both some families of poor Spaniards, although these are very few. t— The whole of the regular troops intheNuevo eyno de Granada (as appears by the Foreigner's Guide, published in Spain, in 1802) amounted to 3290, in which number is comprehended the  garrison of the province of Quito, together with those of Panama, Cartagena, Popayan, &c] 
The settlements of this province are the following : 
San Juan Evangelista, Yaruqui, 
Santa Maria Magda- El Quinche, i lena, Guaillabamba, 
Chillogalle, Machache, 
Conocoto, Aloasi,

The capital is of the same name, with the dedicatory title of San Francisco ; founded by the Indians and the court of their kings, and rebuilt by Sebastian de Belalcazar in 1534, and in 1541 endowed by the Emperor Charles V. with the title of very noble and very loyal city, and for arms, with a castle upon two mountains, and above the same a cross, with two eagles, each holding the cross with one claw. It is situate at the skirt of the mountain and volcano of Pichincho, and has on the e. part the cordillera of the Andes. It is large and well built, though irregular from the inequality of the territory, well peopled, and one of the best cities of S. America. On its entrance to the s. is a spacious llanura, called De Turubamba; but which rightly should be Turupampa, meaning the plain of mud ; and to the n. is another, with the name of Inaquito, celebrated for the battle which was fought there by Gonzalo Pizarro, against the royal troops commanded by Blasco Nunez Vela, first viceroy of Peru, and who lost his life there. 
To the e. of Turubamba and the right of Chimbacalle, and to the left of the settlement of Santa Maria Magdalena, is a small mountain called El Panecillo, from its figure being that of a truncated cone, resembling a sugarloaf, of 100 toises high, and having at its foot on the w. side some small streams of delicate water; which, united to others which flow down from Pichinche, form the river Machangara, which laves the city on the s. 
The principal square is large ; and in one of its fronts is the palace of the president, just opposite to the city -house, in the third the cathedral, and in the fourth the bishop's palace, and Q Q 2    ■ -<rm   QUITO.  in the middle is a beautiful fountain. The houses are lofty, and of handsome appearance, and the churches and convents the best in America; especially the front of the convent of San Francisco, which is of excellent architecture ; and not less so is the college which belonged to the Jesuits. It has six parishes of so many wards into which the city is divided, which are called El Sagrario, Santa Barbara, San Bias, San Sebastian, San Roque, San Marcos, and Santa Prisca. It has also two convents of the religious of St. Domingo, three of San Franciso, with the college of San Buenaventura, two of La Merced, one of San Agustin, another of the Bethlemite Fathers, and a college and novitiate of the Jesuits ; five monasteries of nuns, two of Carmelites, one of La Concepcion, another of Santa Clara, another of Santa Catalina de Sena, ana house for retired women, called the Beaterio, with the title of Santa Marta, under the direction of the fathers of La Merced. This capital is adorned by two universities ; the one of San Gregorio Magno, which was of the Jesuits, and the most illustrious, founded by Don Felipe II. in 1586, and enriched with the same privileges as that of Salamanca in 1621; the other of St. Tomas de Aquino, of the Dominican fathers : also two royal colleges, the one of San Luis Rey de Francia, with the title of Colegio Mayor, granted by Don Felipe V. ; likewise a seminary, which was founded by the Bishop Don Luis Lopez de Solis, of the order of San Agustin, in 1594, and consigned to the Jesuits, who governed it till their expulsion. This college has produced many archbishops, bishops, and men renowned for their literature. It is now governed by an ecclesiastic, and its rector is a canon of that holy cathedral church. The other college is of San Fernando, King of Spain, under the direction of the religious of St. Domingo. The Capuchin Fathers have the college abovenamed of San Buenaventura, and the Augustins the academy of San Fulgencio, wherein they confer the degree of doctor. Here are two hospitals, the one for men, and the other for women ; the latter having been built by Senor Ochoa, and both being under the care of the Bethlehemite fathers. The tribunal of the Royal Audience was erected in 1563, extinguished in 1718, and reestablished in 1739; and, besides this tribunal, here are those of the Royal Rents of Crusade, and of the Holy Inquisition, dependent upon Lima. 
Besides the above temples are two chapels ; one within the town, under a large arch of stone,  of fine architecture, dedicated to the Reyna de los Angeles, with this title ; and the other with the title of Vera Cruz, in the llano of Anaquito the place wherein is interred the Viceroy Blasco Nunez Vela. 
In one of the suburbs is a fort, and a narrow bridge, by which to pass the river Machangera, of fine construction, although the builders of the same are not known. It is a head settlement of a bishopric, erected in 1545, suffragan to the archbishopric of Santa Fe. In 1736 were sent to this city, by the Academy of the Sciences of Paris, in order to make astronomical and physical observations, Luis Godin, Peter Bouguer, Charles Condamine, and others; the same ha vinoheen accompanied by the naval officers Don Jorge Juan and Don Antonio de Ulloa; and these, having finished their labours, perpetuated the memory of them by an inscription, which was engraved in alabaster, and fixed on a wall of the church of the Jesuits, and which is as follows :

Don Carlos de la Condamine discovered also the meridian in the terrace of the college of the Jesuits, but, having made it upon brick, it was lost by time ; and in 1766 another meridian was established upon stone, in the same spot as before, the following inscription being affixed on a piece of marble, on a wall close by.

This same Pichinchensan academy projected and built the beautiful pass without the city, at  the entrance of the Santa Prisia, in the llanura of Anaquito, putting in the inner front of the gate, or entrance, the following inscription, on a marble slab.

The population of Quito is composed of 58,000 inhabitants, Spaniards, Creoles, people of colour, and Indians. Amongst the former are six titles of marquises, one of count, and many knights of military orders, and several illustrious families. The Creoles are docile, humane, courteous, liberal, attached to foreigners, inclined to piety, and of an acute genius and capacity. The Indians are the most civilized of the kingdom, extremely dexterous in all arts and offices, and particularly in painting and sculpture. [The population, in 1802, had increased to 70,000 souls — the greater part of them are Indians, and it has been suggested, by persons well acquainted with the country, and disposed to favour the new order of things establishing there, that the town should be called "the capital ofthe Indians."] 
The temperature is so benign, that the common clothing, the whole year round, is nothing but a mixture of silk and wool. It abounds in all kinds of the most exquisite vegetable productions, with which it furnishes the settlements and cities of its jurisdiction ; so that its marketplace affords an immense collection of fruits, flowers, birds, garden herbs, and whatever the imagination may solicit, for the luxury of life ; and all being very cheap. It formerly had a lucrative commerce, but which has fallen off considerably. With all the above advantages, it has always been much afflicted with earthquakes, which have caused the greatest mischief; as was most particularly the case in that of 1755. It has a body of militia, which was established after the insurrection of the people in 1765. It is the native place of many persons illustrious for their virtues, military and literary talents; and such are,

==[[Quiva|QUIVA]]==, a province of California in N. America, very thinly peopled with barbarian Indians, and consequently but little known : between lat. 30° and 35° n. 
==[[Quivio|QUIVIO]]==, a settlement and asiento of silver mines, of the province and corregimiento of Chumbivilcas in Peru. 
==[[Quiviquinta|QUIVIQUINTA]]==, a settlement of the head settlement of the district and alcaldia mayor of Acaponeta in Nueva Espana. Eight leagues n. of its capital. 
==[[Quivira|QUIVIRA]]==, a province of New Mexico in N. America, discovered by Francisco Vazquez Coronado, native of Salamanca, through the order of the viceroy of Nueva Espana, Don Antonio de Mendosa, in 1542. It is a plain country, without trees, stones, or any thing whatever. It was very thinly peopled, and its natives go naked, covering only the parts of shame with leather ; of which substance they also make shoes. The Women have the vanity of wearing their hair very long. They have no bread of any sort, and their principal aliment is flesh, which they most frequently eat raw, as they have no fuel or any thing to make fire, save cowdung; the fat of Which animal they eat immediately from the beast, and the blood of which they drink whilst warm. They wander about in great tribes, and often change their abode, like the Moors, being directed in this by the pastures which they may find for their cattle, their only source of wealth. These oxen are as large as those of Europe, although their horns are shorter ; they have a large lump on the front of the head, and on their foreparts is a very long wool ; so that in front the hair hanging in knots, has the appearance of a long beard. The neck is long and hairy in the extreme. They are nimble but ugly to behold ; and from them the Indians provide themselves with food, drink, clothing, shoes, &c. Of their  skins also they make ropes ; of their bones, bodkins ; of the muscles and hair, thread ; of the horns, stomach, and bladder, vessels for drinking- ; of the dung, fire and candle ; of. the calves, vessels for holding' water ; and, in short, from them altogether they derive every thingnecessary to their mode of life. There are also in this province other animals as large as horses, but which, from havinghorns and wool, they call sheep ; also dogs of an immense size and fierceness, which vie with a bull, and carry loads of two arrobas weight when the Indians go out to the chase, or proceed to change their residence. This country produces many fruits ; such as cherries, mulberries, nuts, melons, and grapes. When the Spaniards arrived here the governor was the cacique, called Tatarras ; and the names of the chief persons who arrived were, Andres Decampo, a Portuguese ; Fr. Juan Padilla, of the order of S. Francisco, and another religious; also 12 converted Indians of Mechoacan. But the Quivirenses having put to death some of these, the rest escaped ; the Portuguese, however, remaining prisoner and not effecting his escape till 10 months afterwards, by the protection of two dogs ; arriving at Mexico with his hair and nails excessively grown : and from this time it has never been attempted to reduce the natives of this province. In lat. 42° n. ; of a mild climate, and abounding in water. 

==[[Quixe|QUIXE]]==, a settlement of the province and ' corregimiento of Lucanas in Peru ; annexed to the curacy of the settlement of Querobamba. 
QUIXOS Y ==[[Macas|MACAS]]==, a province and government of the kingdom of Quito ; bounded n. by the province of Pastos, s. by that of Cuenca, w. by those of Tacunga and Ambaro, from the which it is divided by the Cordillera of mountains of Cotopaxi and Cayamburu, and e. by the government and missions of Mainas. It is a country extremely mountainous, full of ravines, and abounding in rivers, some of which are very large, and all running into the Maranon. This territory is impassable, except on foot; and thus it was traversed by the missionaries, who at the expense of great labours and fatigues entered Mainas. Its temperature is cold, and it produces much cotton and tobacco, which is particularly esteemed in Peru, whither it is carried by Guayaquil and Piura. The cultivation of these fruits is the cause why little attention is paid to wheat, maize, and barley, of these only as much being sown as are barely sufficient for the wants of the inhabitants ; not but that the llanuras and ravines are extremely fertile. Here 
VOL. IV.  

QUI  are minerals of gold and of blue dust, and a resin which they call here estoraque, and which is, in fact, very fine. Cinnamon is produced here in abundance, and would, if properly cultivated, be as good as that of Ceylon, although what there is, is in great estimation and of great consumption in the provinces of Peru. 
This country was discovered by Gonzalo Diaz de Pinada, in 1536, who was sent by Sebastian de Belalcazar, from Popayan, to investigate the embouchure of the grand river Magdalena, and to acquire information respecting the countries bordering upon it : and with advices thus received Gonzalo Pizarro, governor of Quito, in 1539 ; but the bad success and perils of this journey did not suffer their views to be realized; and, accordingly, the territory remained uncultivated until 1559, when Don Andres Hurtado, Marquis of Canete, Viceroy of Peru, sent Gil Ramirez Davalos to conquer and settle it ; as he really effected, reducing the natives. This province is at present divided into two districts ; which are those of Quito and Macas. It is bounded e. by that of Mainas, s. by the government of Bracamoros and Yaguarsongo, and w. by the cordillera of the Andes. In both these districts the inhabitants are continually infested with incursions from the infidel Indians, who surround the said districts on all sides ; and thus each settlement has a certain set of savages to molest it continually ; and should the inhabitants of the said settlements issue out against these troublesome invaders, the only advantage they obtain is putting them to flight for a time and taking a few prisoners, whilst the rest return, after a certain period, with fresh vigour ; although they never form any thing like a regular settlement, but merely wait about the regular settlements for a convenient opportunity for plunder, the sole object of their lives. This harassing state to which the settlements have constantly been exposed, is the principal cause, not to mention the climate, why the population is in such a state of decrease. 
The cities and settlements of this province are the following :

It is of a moderately hot temperature, and abounding in vegetable productions and delicate fruits ; as also in cattle, birds, and game, and most particularly in sugar canes. Inasmuch as it is scantily supplied with wheat, the natives are accustomed to bread of maize, since this is brought with great ease in two days from Suchitepeque, where it abounds. The fertility and umbrageous nature of this settlement made it formerly a curacy in great request by the religious of the order of St. Domingo, to whom it belonged, until that the king commanded that the clergy should prevail throughout all America. Its population consists  of 18,000 Indians, and to it are annexed the settlements of Salania and of Choi. Rabinal, a mountain near the former settlement, from whence it is named.

It passes by Brunswick and Amboy, and mingling with the waters of the Arthur Kull Sound, helps to form the fine harbour of Amboy. At Rariton Hills, through which this river passes, is a small cascade, where the water falls 15 or 20 feet, very romantically between two rocks. Opposite to Brunswick the river is so shallow, that it is fordable at low water for horses and carriages ; but a little below it deepens so fast, that a 20 gun ship may ride securely at any time of tide. The tide rises so high, that large shallops used to pass a mile above the ford ; so that it was no uncommon thing to see vessels of considerable burden riding at anchor, and a number of large river craft lying above, some dry, and others on their beamends, for want of water, within gun-  .312  RAY  shot of each other. Copper ore has been found on the upper part of this river ; and in the year 1754, the ore of this mine sold for £62 sterling per ton, being of inferior quality to that on Passaik river.

[==[[Raynham|RAYNHAM]]==, a townhip of Massachusets, in Bristol County, taken from Taunton, and incorporated in 1731. It contains 1094 inhabitants. A considerable part of the town lies upon a circular bend of Taunton River, which is between seven and eight rods wide, and affords great plenty of herrings and other fish, but so unfavourable is it, in this place, to seining or fishing, that the exclusive privilege of fishing is annually sold for less than 12 shillings, while the same privilege in Bridgewater and Middleborough, (towns which bound this ; the former on the e. the latter on the n.) is annually sold for £250. Besides the great river there are several useful streams, upon which are six sawmills, three gristmills, one furnace, a forge, and fullingmill. There are numerous ponds in this township, of which Nippaniquit or Nippahonset, is two miles long and one in breadth. Here alewives, in millions, annually resort and leave their spawns. An excellent kind of iron ore, and various kind of fish, are found here. Besides the usual business of husbandry and mechanics, numbers are here employed in the manufactories of bariron, hollow ware, nails, iron for Vessels, iron shovels, potash, shingles, &c. The first forge set up in America was introduced into this town by James and Henry Leonard, natives of England, 1652. This forge was situate on the great road, and is still in employ by the family of Leonards of the sixth generation ; a family remarkable for longevity, promotion to public office, and a kind of hereditary attach-   nient to the iron manufacture. King Philip's huntinghouse stood on the n. side of Fowling Pond, which is If miles from the forge. In the winter season the Indian monarch resided at Mount Hope, probably for the benefit of fish. Philip and the Leonards lived on such good terms, and such was Philip's friendship and generosity, that as soon as the war broke out in 1675, which ended in the death of the king and the ruin of his tribe, he gave out strict orders to all his Indians, never to hurt the Leonards. Before Philip's war, Fowling Pond was two miles long and threefourths of a mile wide. Now the water is almost gone, and the large tract it once covered, is grown up to a thick set swamp of cedar and pine. The soil of this pond has also a prolific virtue in generating ore. Copious beds of ore, in this part of the country, are usually found in the neighbourhood of pine swamps, or near to soils natural to the growth of pine or cedar. In this place there has been almost an inexhaustible fund of excellent ore, from which the forge has been supplied and kept going for more than 80 years, besides great quantities carried to other works, and yet here is ore still ; but this, like other things in a state of youth, is weak, and incapable of being wrought into iron of the best quality.]

It was founded by Luis Diaz de Melgarejo in 1543, near the river Parana, on the e. bank. [Near this place the River Parana is divided into two channels, forming the Island of Salto, which is about 44 miles long and five or six wide. This city is on the small stream of Tambo.] Its situation was fertile, delightful and healthy, and it had in its vicinity some mines of excellent copper. It was 225 miles from Asuncion to the n. e. in lat. 23° 35 / s. See Ontiveros. 
Real, an island of the river St. Lawrence in Canada, 60 miles from the Lake Ontario. It is extremely fertile, and produces many kinds of grain, and has a good fort, built by the French, which was taken by the English under General Amherst in 1760, after a bombardment of two days. 
Real, a bay on the coast of the Straits of Magellan, between the great bay of S. Bartolome and the Ancon de los Paxaros. 
Real, a river of the province and captainship  
Its principal commerce consists in pitch, tar, and cordage, in which it is extremely abundant. Its territory is well irrigated by different rivers ; of the which, that which enters the sea in the port has eight arms, the same being so many other canals, by which are brought to the city, from the settlements of its jurisdiction, and from the estates and mills, the sugar and other productions. 
William Dampierre, in his voyage round the world, asserts that this place is more notable than any on that coast, as having a mountain which is always burning, known by the name of the Old Volcano, seven leagues from the coast, and which is seen at 20 leagues at sea. The river, which flows down from the capital, Leon, is s. <?. of the port, but the territory on either shore is so low as to be inundated by the tides ; and so thickly covered is it with mangroves, that it is impossible to penetrate through them. 
The port is much frequented by vessels from Acapulco, Panama, and other parts of the S. Sea ; and at the entrance of it is an island, where the sea breaks its force, and by which two channels are formed, the best of which is on the n. w. side. This city has suffered many invasions by pirates, in the last (16th) century; and is in long. 87° 5' w. lat. 12° 30' n.

It is called De la Concepcion and De la Posesion, and is one of those which, in Nueva Espaila, is termed De la Otra Costa; and it is capable of containing 200 vessels. The city, which is small, is surrounded with trenches, for its defence. It is of an hot temperature, and unhealthy, owing to the stagnant waters. It has three churches and an hospital, many orchards and gardens, and a dock, in which have been built many vessels.  joins the Mexical and Alcabon to enter the great river Jacques or Santiago.

[==[[Receiffe|RECEIFFE]]==, a harbour on the coast of Brazil; it is a very strong place, and near the city of Olinda, in lat. 8° 10' s. The whole coast of Brazil is bordered by a thick and flat ridge of rocks, which is in some places 20, and in others 30 yards broad; and were it not for several breaks and chasms in this rocky inclosure, it would be altogether impracticable to approach the shore. That part which is here denominated Reciffe, is a very large passage towards the n. of  red Olinda, but the ridge of rocks again appears almost before the city, and the inhabitants enter it in boats at high water. This part of the ridge is termed by the Portugese Reciffo, and by the Dutch the Receif. On the n. point is a very narrow open passage, through which ships approach the shore, and between this ridge of rocks and the main land, is a sandy island, about one league in length, called the Sandy Receif. On this island the Portuguese had constructed a strong fort, well provided with artillery, and which by them was deemed impregnable. Of this the Dutch Admiral Sonk, in about the year 1630, made himself master, and having strengthened the Stony Receif, he rendered it the chief seat of commerce, and it became afterwards one of the most considerable places in Brazil.]

[Red River, a large river which rises in the province of New Mexico, about 100 miles to the n.e. of Santa Fe, the capital of the above province. It pursues a very serpentine direction to the s. e. through the immense province of Louisiana, and enters the Mississippi on its w. bank, in lat. 31° 3' n. The length of this river in a direct line (exclusive of its windings, which considerably add to its length), from its source to its  

RED  junction with the Mississippi, is 735 geographical miles. Innumerable are the rivers which enter the above in its course. 
Mr. Pike has investigated, (in 1807), very particularly the courses of three prodigious rivers : first, that called Platte, by the French fur hunters, a corruption of the Spanish Plata, or Silver River, perhaps from its transparency near its source ; and which our fur hunters have again corrupted into Plat River, from the French Plata. This is the furthest to the n. 2. The Arkansa, a stream of about 2000 miles in length. And, 3. The Red River, of nearly an equal extent. These vast rivers are now clearly discerned, rolling their majestic waters from a chain of mountains on the n. of New Mexico (some of which equal Mount Blanc in height), through the vast w. extent of Louisiana, till they join the Mississippi, or more properly the Missouri ; thus opening a prodigious navigation to the United States of America, and leading to important settlements in that direction. It is delightful to contemplate the first accounts of these extensive regions, the climate and natural advantages of many parts of which may one day contribute to render them the seats of learning and civilization, and which are now peopled by a race, that offers the most tempting subject to the exertions of the philanthropist. 
Before this country was explored by our author, the amazing length of these rivers was far from being accurately known, and it was supposed that the chief streams directed their course to the Gulf of Mexico, so that the navigation and commerce would have been subject to impediments from a foreign power. The most fertile portion of the territory appears to be that in the neighbourhood of the United States ; while to the w. and*, there occur great deserts, sometimes of sand like those of Africa, and sometimes resembling the steppes of Siberia. The sight of such vast plains void of trees, in the midst of the American forests, has suggested to travellers an idea that the trees have been destroyed by some accidental cause. 
But our author has shown that the cause is in the soil itself, which is either moveable sand wafted by every wind, or too thin to bear trees. Nor does petrified timber appear to be found, as in several pasts of the deserts of Africa. The datetree might perhaps be cultivated on the skirts of these American deserts. But our author regards them as advantageous, in an enlarged view of policy, as by preventing the progress of] s s 2  fm    - mm  RED  [population towards the s. w. they confine the United States within such boundaries, as may afford to the people of that extensive country a fair prospect of maintaining the present form of government, instead of undergoing the political changes incident to an empire stretching over too wide a surface. 
The regions of Louisiana may be said to have been first dimly descried by Father Hennepin, a religious missionary, whose voyage down the Mississippi is now chiefly remarkable, as giving an account of the numerous peachtrees which he observed in every direction, and which seem to have been indigenous} though the Americans continue to regard the peach as a foreign fruit. The unfortunate adventure of M. de la Salle, at the same period, 1680-1690, is well known; but after the assassination of their chief, some of his men penetrated to the river Arkansa, where they formed a little post ; and it is remarkable that this river, as well as the Red River, are tolerably well delineated, as arising in the mountains of New Mexico, by M. du Pratz, in the map which he constructed for his valuable history of Louisiana, published in three volumes, Paris, 1758 ; though the indications are so vague that he was not followed by succeeding geographers. It is also not a little remarkable, that he represents the rivers, which fall into the Gulf of Mexico, as of a short and confined course, being divided from the Red River by a broad level of high land. His goldmine on the Arkansa, about 40 miles below a fall or rapid of that river, has also escaped recent attention. M. St. Denis, and other French settlers, repeatedly passed from Mobile to the s. of New Mexico, and even to the capital city of Mexico ; and it is probable that, from their memorials, Du Pratz formed his map, which was, however, clouded with so much doubt and uncertainty, that no dependance could be placed upon it. But by Major Pike's exertions and perseverance, through the greatest difficulties and dangers, the geography of this interesting country assumes, for the first time, a clear and authentic form, the rivers being laid down, with all their surprising meanders, from actual and careful surveys, executed with the accuracy of modern science, and the precision of modern instruments.

==[[Remedios|REMEDIOS]]==, Nuestra Senora de Los, a city, the capital of the province and government of the Rio del Hacha in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada : founded on the shores of this river by Nicholas Federman, with the title of Nuestra Senora de las Nieves, which it afterwards changed to that which it now holds. It is of an hot temperature, and has been rich and commercial through its fisheries of pearl, which, although not large, were of very fine orient, and highly esteemed. But this lucrative trade has now entirely fallen off, or is practised only by a few Guajiros Indians ; and the city is reduced to a miserable state, through the invasions it has experienced. It has a very good parish church, in which is venerated a miraculous image of Nuestra Senora ; which image, whenever the city was invaded, used to turn its back upon it, and its face towards the mountain ; the truth of which miracle is justly authenticated, through the precautions taken by the bishop of Santa Marta, to whose diocese it belonged. It has also convents of religious : the one of S. Francisco, the other of S. Domingo. This city is defended by a castle, of very regular construction, called San Jorge. It was taken and sacked by Francis Drake in 1596, who set fire to it, and retired with a considerable number of pearls which he found in it.

It is of a hot and sickly temperature, of a craggy territory, mountainous, and full of swamps, but abounding in washingplaces of gold,in which the inhabitants are employed. It produces also much cacao, sugarcane, and cotton, of which they make many woven stuffs; also abundance of swine, on the flesh of which the natives all subsist, and which they carry for sale to Mompox. Here are also found in profusion plantains, yucas, and other productions of a warm climate ; also fish, which is a common food. Besides the great heat, it is afflicted with mosquitoes, snakes, and several other venomous reptiles. It is inhabited by 500 housekeepers, and is 89 miles n. w. of Santa Fe, and 35 n. by w. from Honda, in lat. 5° 42' n. and long. 75° W w. 
Remedios, a celebrated sanctuary of Nuestra  Senora (Our Lady), situate in a dry mountain 
Elain, in the alcaldia mayor of Coyoacan and ingdom of Nueva Espaiia. This image, which is about a third of a yard high, was carried to that kingdom by one of the captains who assisted the celebrated Hernan Cortes in its conquest ; and who, in the night that he was retiring from Mexico, having left it wrapped up in a mat made of pita, was prevented, through his death, which took place the same night, from taking it up again ; so that it was not discovered till some years after by a newly converted Indian. He took it to his house and shut it up in a case, putting with it, through his ignorance, some maize, and other food, for its nourishment ; but returning to look at it, was astonished to find that both the food and the image had disappeared; and the latter was discovered, shortly after, in the exact place from whence it had been taken. This account of the Indian so astonished the city of Mexico, it determined to raise for it, in that spot, a sumptuous temple, to which it was made the patron ; and now, by the order of the king, a solemn feast is observed yearly on the first of September, at which assist the tribunals and the nobility. The same solemnity takes place when the image is carried to the cathedral for supplication, whenever its protection may be thought necessary, in cases of necessity, sickness, drought, and war, and at the dispatch of the fleets.

They are five, and called by the French Malingre, Le Pere, La Mere, and Les Deux Filles, these being barren and dry rocks ; called also by some The Breasts. They are nearly joined, and lie at a quarter of a league to e.s.e. of that of La Mere. The greater of them is Le Pere, which is situate e. n.e. of Mont Joly, at the distance of 1^ league, and is about an eighth of a league long. La Malingre is very small, and lies one league e.n.e. of the mountain of Remontabo, and l£ league from that of Le Pere. All these isles are of a very healthy climate, and vessels may pass very near to them without the least danger ; since at the lowest tides there is five or six fathoms depth, save on  

REM  the n. side of the island of Le Pere, where there is a sandbank extending a quarter of a league. The launches and barks may pass between the continent and these islands, where, at low water, there remain 15 feet of water. But this pass is dangerous for large vessels, on account of a chain of rocks, some above, and others below the sea, in the middle of the channel, between the coast of Cayenne and the islands of Pere and Malingre. 
This shoal is found n.n.w. of Mont Joly, at the distance of threefourths of a league, and 5° to the $, e. of the mountain of Remontabo, at somewhat more than a league's distance, and was discovered by a skilful French pilot in 1701. 
The island of Malingre is elevated a little above the water, and on the w. side of it is another rock, which extends nearly 300 toises to n.n.w, and the which at ebb tide stands more than half out of water; it being necessary always strictly to avoid the same. Round this island, at the distance of 100 toises, are 15 to 16 feet of water in ebb tide ; which, joined to eight or nine when the tide is up, make 24 or 25 feet. The isle of l'Enfant is to the n. e. one quarter to the e. of that of Malingre, at threefourths of a league's distance, and 2£ to the n. one quarter to n. w. of Cayenne. In coming to this island it is usual to anchor between La Malingre and l'Enfant, to wait for the proper tides. The anchorage here is very good, in 25 feet of water at ebb tide, with a muddy bottom. Vessels also come to anchor to e. n. e. and n. e. of l'Enfant, at one half or threequarters of a league's distance, in 25 feet water, with the same bottom as above. But to the e. and s. e. of this island there are only from 10 to 16 feet of water, To the w. of the same island, and at threequarters of a league's distance, are found from 10 to 29 feet of water, but, approaching two or three cables length into shore, there are not more than eight, although at the foot of the land and all round the island there are 25 feet water, as was proved by the soundings made by the French frigate of war, La Charente, by order of the court, in 1736, with a view of discovering a passage for vessels under the necessity of proceeding when the wind might be to n. e. one quarter to e., it being impossible for them to make any way with a n. e. wind. It did not however succeed in finding sufficient depth, for, although there was as much water as a ship might draw within a stone's throw of the land, yet it is thought too hazardous an attempt where the currents are so rapid as they are here. ==[[Remolino|REMOLINO]]==, a settlement of the province   REN and government of Santa Marta in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada ; on the shore of the grand river Magdalena.

It abounds equally in mines of silver, copper, and lead, and has a good parishchurch, and a convent of religious of St. Domingo ; but is very much reduced and poor, although not without some families of distinction. In the mountains of its vicinity, to the n. and to the e. dwell some barbarian and ferocious Indian nations.

"RHODE ==[[Island|ISLAND]]==, is one of the smallest of the United States ; its greatest length being 43 miles, and its greatest breadth 39 ; or about 1300 square miles. It is bounded n. and e. by the commonwealth of Massachusetts, 5. by the Atlantic Ocean, and w. by Connecticut. These limits comprehend what is called Rhode Island and Providence Plantations ; divided into five counties, viz. Newport, Providence, Washington, Bristol, and Kent, which are subdivided into 30 townships ; the number of inhabitants of which, viz. in Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, was in the year 1730,-15,352 whites, 1748,-29,755 do. do. do. do. do. And by the census of 1810, the total population of this state amounted to 76,931 souls. 
Narraganset Bay makes up from 5. to n. between the main land on the e. and w. and embosoms many fertile islands, the principal of which are Rhode Island, Canonnieut, Prudence, Patience, Hope, Dyer's, and Hog Islands. Block Island is the southernmost land belonging to the state. The harbours are, Newport, Providence, Wickford, Patuxet, Warren, and Bristol. 
Rhode Island, from which the state takes half its name, lies between lat. 41° 22', and 41° 35' n. and between long. 71° 8' and 71° 20" w. from Greenwich ; being about 13 miles long from n. e. to s. w., and about S\ broad, on an average. It is divided into three townships, Newport, Portsmouth, and Middletown. Perhaps no island in the world exceeds this in point of soil, climate, and situation. In its most flourishing state it was called by travellers, the Eden of America. But the change which the ravages of war, and a decrease of business, have effected, is great. Between 30,000 and 40,000 sheep are fed on this island, besides neat cattle and horses. The state is intersected in all directions by rivers ; the chief of which are Providence and Taunton rivers, which fall into Narraganset Bay ; the former on the m the latter on the e. side of Rhode Island. Rhode Island is as healthy a country as any in America. The winters in the maritime parts of the state are milder than in the inland country; the air being softened by a seavapour, Avhich also enriches the soil. The summers are delightful, especially on Rhode Island, where the extreme heats which prevail in other parts of America,  
•  

RHODE ISLAND.  are allayed by cool and refreshingbreezes from the sea. The rivers and bays swarm with fish, to the amount of more than 70 different kinds ; the markets are alive with them. Oysters, lobsters, and other shellfish, abound in Narraganset Bay. Travellers are generally agreed, that Newport is the best fishmarket in the world. This state produces corn, rye, barley, oats, and in some parts wheats, sufficient for home consumption ; and the various kinds of grasses, fruits, and culinary roots and plants in great abundance, and in perfection ; cider is made for exportation. 
The n. no. parts of the state are but thinly inhabited, and are more rocky and barren than the other parts. The tract of land lying between N. and S. Kingston on the e. and Connecticut on the no. called Shannock Country, or Purchase, is excellent grazing land, and is inhabited by a number of wealthy farmers, who raise some of the finest neat cattle in New England, weighing from 1600 to 1800 weight. They keep large dairies, and make butter and cheese of the best quality, and in large quantities for exportation. Iron ore is found in great plenty in several parts of the state. The iron works on Patuxent River, 12 miles from Providence, are supplied with ore from a bed 4-f miles distant, which lies in a valley, through which runs a brook. The brook is turned into a new channel, and the ore pits are cleared of water by a steam engine. At this orebed are a variety of ores, curious stones, and ochres. 
In the township of Cumberland is a coppermine mixed with iron, strongly impregnated with loadstone, of which some large pieces have been found in the neighbourhood. No method has yet been discovered to work it to advantage. Abundance of limestone is found in this state, particularly in the county of Providence ; of which large quantities of lime are made and exported. This limestone is of different colours, and is the true marble of the white, plain, and variegated kind. It takes as fine a polish as any stone in America. There are several mineral springs in this state ; to one of which, near Providence, many people resort to bathe and drink the water. 
Newport and Providence are the chief towns of this state. The town of Bristol carries on a considerable trade to Africa, the W. Indies, and to different parts of the United States. But by far the greatest part of the commerce of Rhode Island, is at present carried on by the inhabitants of the flourishing town of Providence, which had,  in 1791, 129 sail of vessels, containing 11,942 tons. 
The exports from the state are flaxseed, lumber, horses, cattle, beef, pork, fish, poultry, onions, butter, cheese, barley, grain, spirits, cotton and linen goods. The imports consist of European and W. India goods, and logwood from the Bay of Honduras. Upwards of 600 vessels enter and clear annually at the different ports in the state. The amount of exports from this state to foreign countries, for one year, ending September SO, 1791, was 407,131 dollars, 9 cents ; in 1792, 698,084; in 1793, 616,416; and in 1794, 954,573 dollars. The inhabitants of this state are progressing rapidly in manufactures. A cotton manufactory has been erected at Providence. Jeans, fustians, denims, thicksetts, velvets, &c. &c. are here manufactured and sent to the S. States. Large quantities of linen and tow cloth are made in different parts of this state for exportation. But the most considerable manufactures in this state are those of iron ; such as bar and sheet iron, steel, nailrods, and nails, implements of husbandry, stoves, pots, and other household utensils, the ironwork of shipping, anchors, bells, &c. 
The constitution of this state is founded on the charter granted by Charles II. in 1663 ; and the frame of government was not essentially altered by the revolution. The legislature of the state consists of two branches; a senate or upper house, composed of 10 members, besides the governor and deputygovernor, called in the charter, assistants; and a house of representatives, composed of deputies from the several towns. The members of the legislature are chosen twice a year ; and there are two sessions of this body annually, viz. on the first Wednesday in May, and the last Wednesday in October. 
This state was first settled from Massachusetts. Mr. Roger Williams, a minister, who came over to New England in 1631, was charged with holding a variety of errors, and was on that account forced to leave his house, land, wife, and children, at Salem, in the dead of winter, and to seek a residence without the limits of Massachusetts. Governor Winthrop advised him to pursue his course to Nehiganset, or Narraganset Bay, which he did, and fixed himself at Secunk, or Seekhonk, now Rehoboth. But that place being within the bounds of Plymouth Colony, Governor Winslow, in a friendly manner, advised him to remove to the other side of the river, where the lands were not covered by anypatent. Accordingly, in 1636, Mr. Williams and 
T T 2  K 1 A  four others, crossed Seekhonk River, and landed among the Indians, by whom they were hospitably received, and thus laid the foundation of a town, which, from a sense of God's merciful providence to him, he called Providence. Here he was soon after joined by a number of others, and though they were secured from the Indians by the terror of the English, yet they, for a considerable time, suffered much from fatigue and want ; but they enjoyed liberty of conscience, which has ever since been inviolably maintained in this state. So little has the civil authority to do with religion here, that no contract between a minister and a society (unless incorporated for that purpose) is of any force. It is probably for these reasons, that so many different sects have ever been found here ; and that the Sabbath and all religious institutions, have been more neglected in this, than in any other of the New England states.]

The ground the lighthouse stands upon is about 12 feet above the surface of the sea at high water. From the ground to the top of the cornice is 58 feet, round which is a gallery, and within that stands the lantern, which is about 11 feet high, and eight feet diameter.

[==[[Ricaras|RICARAS]]==, Indians of N. America, the remains of 10 large tribes of the Panias, who have been reduced by the smallpox, and the Sioux, to the present number. They live in fortified villages, and hunt immediately in their neighbourhood. The country around them, in every direction, for several hundred miles, is entirely   bare of timber, except on the water courses and steep declivities of hills, where it is sheltered from the ravages of fire. The land is tolerably well watered, and lies well for cultivation. The remains of the villages of these people are to be seen on many parts of the Missouri, from the mouth of Tetone River to the Mandans. They claim no land except that on which their villages stand, and the fields which they cultivate. The Tetons claim the country around them. Though they are the oldest inhabitants, they may properly be considered the farmers or tenants at will of that lawless, savage, and rapacious race, the Sioux Teton, who rob them of their horses, plunder their gardens and fields, and sometimes murder them, without opposition. If these people were freed from the oppression of the Tetons, their trade would increase rapidly, and might be extended to a considerable amount. They maintain a partial trade with their oppressors, the Tetons, to whom they barter horses, mules, corn, beans, and a species of tobacco which they cultivate ; and receive in return gums, ammunition, kettles, axes, and other articles which the Tetons obtained from the Yanktons of the n. and Sissatones, who trade with Mr. Cammeron, on the river St. Peters.

[Richmond, the present seat of government of the state of Virginia, is situate in Henrico County, on the n. side of James's River, just at the foot of the falls, and contains between 400 and 500 houses, and nearly 4000 inhabitants. Part of the houses are built on the margin of the river, convenient for business ; the rest are upon a hill which overlooks the lower part of the town, and commands an extensive prospect of the river and adjacent country. The new houses are well built. A large statehouse, or capitol, has lately been erected on the hill. This city likewise boasts of an elegant statue of the illustrious Washington, which was formed at Paris. The lower part of the town is divided by a creek, over which is a convenient bridge. A bridge between 300 and 400 yards in length has been thrown across James's River, at the foot of the fall, by Colonel Mayo. That part from Manchester to the island is built on 15 boats. From the island to the rocks was formerly a floating bridge of rafts ; but the enterprising proprietor has now built it of framed log piers, filled with stones. From the rocks to the landing at Richmond, the bridge is continued on framed piers filled with stones. The bridge connects the city with Manchester; and as the passengers pay toll, it produces a handsome revenue to Colonel Mayo, who is the sole proprietor. The public buildings,  besides the statehouse, are an episcopal church, a courthouse, gaol, a theatre, and three tobacco warehouses. The falls above the bridge are seven miles in length. A noble canal is cutting, and nearly completed, on the n. side of the river, which is to terminate in a basin of about two acres, in the town of Richmond. From this basin to the wharfs in the river will be a land carriage of about a mile. The expense is estimated at £30,000 Virginia currency. The opening of this canal promises the addition of much wealth to Richmond. Vessels of burden lie at City Point, 20 miles below, to which the goods from Richmond are sent down in boats. It is 626 miles from Boston, 374 from New York, 176 from Baltimore, 278 from Philadelphia, 247 from Fayetteville, 497 from Charleston, and 662 from Savannah.

It is in extent 30 leagues from e. to w. and 16 in width from n. to s. It is of a cold temperature, as well from the loftiness of its territory, as because it is in the vicinity of the mountain or paramo 'Chimborzu ; although it does not want some settlements enjoying a moderate climate. This jurisdiction is divided into two parts; and in the second is a lieutenant of the corregidor  who resides at Ambato, the capital. It is very abundant in cattle ; of the wools of which the natives fabricate annually upwards of 1000 pieces of cloth, as also stockings and other manufactures, by which they maintain a good trade ; and the wool they collect annually is reckoned at 14,000 arrobas. It also yields much sugarcane, of which a considerable portion of sugar is made, as also brandy ; wheat of the best quality ever known, maize, barley, and all kinds of fruit. Some few years since have been discovered some silver mines, which promise great riches, although they are not worked for want of proper energy. It may be said, in a few words, that nothing in this province is wanting that can conduce either to the comfort or necessaries of life. It is of an extremely fertile and delightful territory. It Avas well peopled by the Curuayes Indians, a very valorous race, and who fought a battle in the plain of Trocajas with Sebastian de Belalcazar, to defend the entrance into their territory against him : and it was a long time before the dispute was finished. But after they were reduced to the dominion of the Spaniards they became a diligent and laborious people.

Pelileo, The capital is the town of the same name ; founded at the extremity of an extensive valley at the foot of the sierra, and opposite the snowy paramo or mountain of Chimborazo, which makes it of a cold but healthy temperature. It was a town of the Puruayes Indians, and conquered by the Adelantado Sebastian de Belalcazar in 1533 ; and in the following year it was begun to be settled by the Marshal Diego de Almagro. It abounds greatly in pastures and choice produc-    R 1 O tions ; has many workshops, wherein they make cloths, baizes, and other woollen articles, and particularly stockings, which are of great estimation throughout the kingdom. 
The town is large and handsome, the streets wide and straight, the buildings of stone and mortar, though the greater part low, for fear of earthquakes. It has, besides a parish church, which is magnificent, another parish, with the name of San Sebastian, four convents of religious of the orders of San Francisco, S.Domingo, San Agustin, and La Merced, and a college which belonged to the Jesuits ; also two monasteries of nuns; the one of Carmelites, with the dedicatory title of Santa Teresa, and the other of La Conception, and an hospital of San Juan de Dios, now nearly abandoned. This town has been almost ruined twice by the irruptions of the volcano of Cotopaxi in the years 1698 and 1746. It is watered by a rivulet which rises from a lake called Colta, which is in a llanura in the s. part, of a league long and \ wide, and where waterfowl is found ; moreover, its shores are covered with large estates, amongst which there is one very large, called Sisapongo. The population is composed of nearly 20,000 souls, with many families of distinction ; and, indeed, the greater part of those established in Quito derive their origin from this town, or are related with one another ; inasmuch as, from the times of the conquest, the most noble families of Spain settled at Quito, and still remain there as it were in one general stock, taking the most rigid precautions not to stain their nobility. And thus it is that the intermarriages are confined amongst the illustrious titles of Villarvel, Velasco, Zambrano, Villagomez, Flores, Vallejo, Davalos, Villavicensio, &c. [By the census of 1802, the population was found to amount to exactly 20,000.] The natives are of a docile and acute genius, courteous and affable. 
This town was the native place of Fr. Gaspar de Villaroel, of the order of S. Agustin, archbishop of Chuquisaca, and a celebrated writer ; and of Don Gaspar de Escalona y Aguero, oidor of the audience of Chile, and author of the work entitled " Gazophylacio Regio Peruvico." In lat. 1° 42' s. 
Riobamba, an abundant river of the same province and kingdom, which rises from the paramo or mountain desert of Sisapongo, and at the distance of one league from the settlement of Puni, enters the Cevados.

RIO ==[[Blanco|BLANCO]]==, a province and akaldia mayor of the Nuevo Reyno de Leon in N. America : bounded s. by the real of mines of Charcas in Nueva Galicia, and e. by the Infidel Indians. Its jurisdiction comprehends the province of the Valle de San Antonio de los Llanos ; which was formerly separate from, and afterwards added to this. In each is a religious of the order for the spiritual culture of the Indians. This province produces some seeds, and great quantities of large cattle, from the abundance of its pastures. For its security has been built a garrison, called De Santa Engracia. Fiftyseven miles s. s. e. of Monterrey, its capital. Rio Blanco; San Antonio de, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Chichas and Tarija in Peru ; of the district and jurisdiction of the formeramnd annexed to the curacy of the capital.

See Velhas.] Rio Cabnebo, a settlement of the province and government of Tucuman, in the district and jurisdiction of the city of Cordoba, to the n. of the same, and on the shore of the river. 
Rio Chico, a settlement and real of silvermines ; the capital of the province and akaldia mayor of Ostimuri in Nueva Espana, on the shore of a moderately sized river. Its population is reduced and poor, through the failing of the working of the mines. 
Rio de Cobdoba, a settlement of the province and government of Tucuman in the district and jurisdiction of the city of Cordoba. 
Rio Gbande, a province and captainship of the kingdom of Brazil, taking its name from the river Grande, by which it is irrigated : bounded by the Brasilian sea, n. by the province and captainship of Seara, zv. by the countrv of the Patagueyes and Tobaxares Indians, and s. by the province and captainship of Paraiba; and not by that of Itamaraca, as is erroneously asserted by M. la Martiniere. 
It was conquered hy the Portuguese, at the expense of infinite combats and labours, from the Tapuyas Indians, the natives ; and was erected u u  RIO  
It I O  by the King of Portugal into a county, for Don Lope Hurtado, in the possession of whose house it at present remains. Its natives retired to the w. from whence they have not failed to make constant incursions ; so that the population of the province has been much lessened, and many of the sugarengines destroyed. Nicolas Rosende, who was shipwrecked on its coast, and was saved, with 30 other Portuguese, penetrated the interior of this province ; searching for a rout by land to the other provinces. In his travels he came to the borders of a lake, so large, that, after many days successive travelling along its shore, he could not arrive at the end of it. From some Indians on the side of this lake he procured some extraordinary fine pearls, which they told him they found in the lake ; and he afterwards printed at Lisbon an account of his travels. Besides the above lake, known only by his relation, is another, from whiuh rises the river Grande, and which is 20 leagues in circumference ; from which also most beautiful pearls are extracted. 
The French gained possession of this province in 1601 ; but, in the following year, it was retaken by the Portuguese. Besides the river Grande, it is watered by the Cunhau, which is navigable. The settlements of consideration in it are reduced to the city of Natal, which is the capital, and the towns of Parandibe and Cunhau. 
Rio Grande, San Juan Baptista de, a settlement and garrison of the province and government of Coaguila in Nue va Espana ; on the w. shore of the river Grande delMorte, from whence it takes its title. It was founded to restrain the repeated insults offered by the Infidel Indians ; contains 55 families of Spaniards, including 33 soldiers and corporals, and at a small distance from it are the missions of the religious of S. Francisco. Twentythree miles e. of S. Fernando, and 180 n. of Monastery. 
[The latest accounts respecting this captainship are to be found in the work of Mr. Mawe, from which We shall subjoin the following extracts. The best port (he observes) of this captainship, is situated about 32° s. ; it is dangerous to enter, first, from its being shoal water ; and next, from a violent sea always running, and from the shifting of the sands. Notwithstanding these inconveniences, there is a great trade carried on from this place to all the ports of Brazil, in brigs and small vessels, that do not draw above 10 feet water. After passing the bar, which is long, they enter into an inland sea or lagoon, of deep water,  and navigate to the n. and w. to its head, where the principal river runs into it. To the s. is the lagoon Meni and the neutral ground, a little to the s. of which is the Spanish fortress of Santa Teresa, lately put in repair. 
The principal town is defended by many forts, some of which are upon islets. Since it was taken from the Spaniards by General Coimbra, the Portugueze have much strengthened it, and now there is a very considerable force of cavalry, horseartillery, and foot soldiers ; so that at a short notice, with the addition of the militia, a body of five or 7000 men might be calculated upon. 
The climate is considered very fine, and the soil so productive, that this district may be called the granary of Brazil : the wheat grown here is shipped to all the ports on the coast where bread is used. Farming, however, is carried on in so slovenly ar manner, that the grain is always rough, bad skinned, and extremely foul. It is packed in raw hides, which are sewed up like sacks : it swells, and heats frequently on the passage from Rio Grande to the more northerly ports ; and often, after landing in Rio de Janeiro, it is left on the quay exposed for days to the rain. 
The vicinity of Rio Grande is extremely populous : in a circuit of 20 leagues, the inhabitants, including the troops, are estimated at 100,000. Their principal occupations are, the breeding of cattle, for which the immense tract of pasture land is so well calculated ; the drying and preparing of hides, and the making of charque, or what is called, in the river Plata, jugbeef. It is prepared in the following manner : — After the ox is skinned, the flesh is stripped from the bones in as large flakes as possible, in some degree resembling sides of bacon ; it is put into hot brine, where it remains from 12 to 40 hours, according to the thickness. It is then taken out, drained, and dried in the sun, afterwards made up into packages that weigh about 1501bs. and shipped from this port to all parts of Brazil. It is a general article of consumption among the lower classes and Negroes, and is not unfrequently seen at respectable tables, being in taste somewhat similar to hung beef. It constitutes the general food for the sailors, and forms part of almost every cargo sent out from this port. It has found its way to the W. Indies, where it is in great request, and has been frequently sold, during the war, at 9d. or a Is. per pound. The charque prepared at Rio Grande is much superior to that brought from the river Plata. During the time that the English troops were in possession of]  
It I o 
[Monte Video, in consequence of an apprehension that the cattle might be driven away, and they be in want of supplies, large quantities were contracted for at St. Pedro, which arrived at Monte Video, though not wanted. They were afterwards shipped for the W. India market. 
The quantity of hides exported from hence is almost incredible ; they furnish many vessels with entire cargoes, which are carried to the northern ports, and from thence embarked for Europe. The annual average may be estimated at not less than 300,000. 
Tallow forms another considerable article of commerce, which in general is shipped in the crude state, and not refined, as in the river Plata. The greater part is consumed in Brazil, and the dealers find it preferable to refine the article on the spot, where they manufacture it into candles. It is packed in waste rawhide packages. Some English settlers, disappointed in the river Plata, went to Rio Grande, to establish concerns for curing beef, refining tallow, &c. which they soon found it necessary to abandon. 
Horns and horsehair form an inferior branch of the commerce, and are shipped from this port in great quantities. 
The above are the staple productions of Rio Grande, which give employment to perhaps 100 sail of coasters, some of which make two or three voyages in a year, carrying thither rum, sugar, tobacco, cotton, rice, mandioca, sweetmeats, &c. Almost every vessel brings a greater or smaller number of Negroes, it being the practice at Rio de Janeiro to ship off all those who are illdisposed and troublesome for Rio Grande, whence, if they continue refractory, they are frequently sold into the neighbouring colony. 
Of European merchandise, they bring wine, oil, olives, glass, and a great variety of English commodities, particularly iron (though they much prefer the Swedish), baizes, coatings, stout woollen cloths, Manchester velverets of various qualities and colours, printed cottons, calicoes, muslins, handkerchiefs, silk, cotton, and worsted hosiery, hats, flannels, &c. 
Sailcloth, cordage, anchors, tar, paints, fowlingpieces, ammunition of all sorts, hardware of every description, particularly slaughterknives, some plated ware, and fancy articles. A great part of the goods are conveyed upon horses into the interior, where they are carried from house to house for sale or exchange. 
During the old system, so lately as within these four years, a most lucrative trade was here carried on with the Spaniards, who came in num-    bers, and most eagerly bought up the tobacco^ and such of the English manufactures as could be transported on horseback, at great prices. Thus Rio Grande and its vicinity became very enviable situations, where considerable fortunes were made in a little time, as the goods bought were much in request, though contraband, and were paid for in specie. This trade, so advantageous to each party, is now entirely ruined through the eagerness of our speculators, in overstocking the markets, and selling for two what would have been eagerly bought for six. 
The neighbourhood of the capital is an unpleasant place, being surrouuded with sand and sandhills of no inconsiderable size, formed by the wind blowing the sand in heaps in various directions, which become half indurated, and appear stratified. The excessively high winds, which frequently prevail, blow the sand so as to be very disagreeable, as it enters every part of the house. 
The cattle bred in this captainship are very numerous, and large herds are brought hither from the Spanish frontiers. 
The large river Uruguay rises in this captainship, and empties itself into the river Plata, a little above Buenos Ayres : there are numerous others of less consquence, the banks of which are well stored with wood. Some attempts were lately made, by miners sent from Villa Rica, to work goldwashings. In the neighbourhood of the capital they have some coal. A substance from the same district was shown to Mr. Mawe, which he decided to be wolfram ; and stated that this metal strongly indicated tin, of which it is frequently an attendant in Europe, though probably it may not be so in America or Asia. It was amorphous, not rounded by friction, and weighed at least a pound . Of the geology of this captainship very little is known. 
In various parts jaguars, and other beasts of prey, are very common. Among the granivorous animals are capivaras of great size, deer in great numbers, and armadillos, which afford excellent eating when roasted. Of birds, there are ostriches of the dark coloured species, which go about in flocks in great numbers. There are eagles, hawks, and other birds of prey ; particularly a species of crow of the vulture kind. Cranes, storks, wild turkeys, ducks, partridges, horned plovers, goatsuckers, horned owls, small parrots, cardinals, humming birds, &c. are found in great numbers. 
The inhabitants are, generally speaking, athletic and robust, and so extremely fond of riding,] 
U U 2    R I O  [as not to go the smallest distance on foot. They are esteemed excellent horsemen, and greatly surpass their neighbours in dexterity and agility, particularly in catching cattle with the balls and the lazo. But it ought to be understood, that the Spaniards have Peons on their farms, who are more nearly allied to the Indians than to them ; whereas the Portuguese have Creolians, bred up to the business, or expert Negroes, who are inferior to none in this labour. 
It is singular to Europeans, that in this fine climate, where the thermometer is frequently below 40° Fahrenheit, and where are bred as fine cows as any in the world, and every convenience is at hand for dairies, neither butter nor cheese is made, except on particular occasions ; nor is milk even for coffee to be procured at all times. It may probably be urged, that the production of these articles would not answer the purpose of the farmers : but certainly it might be made to do so ; and Mr. Mawe hesitates not to say, that 100 cows, kept for dairy purposes, would yield to any man capable of rearing, training, and managing them, a greater profit than any other part of husbandry. This colony might easily be made to supply the neighbouring districts, and even the whole of Brazil, with these articles. 
A number of years ago some hemp was grown here, by order of government : it proved excellent, but was abandoned because it was troublesome to dress, and probably did not yield sufficient profit. 
In some places grapes are very good, and probably wine will soon be made from them, as the restraint laid by the mothercountry upon her colonies is now removed. 
For the last two or three years, troops have been continually sent to Rio Grande, where they soon become disciplined, and are ready for any expedition, should hostilities commence with their neighbours. Perhaps in no place could an army be maintained at less expense; their cavalry stands in the highest reputation, and their flyingartilley is said to be equal to any in Europe ; nor is this improbable, when we consider the excellence of their horses, and the increasing discipline with which they are governed.] 
Rio Grande, a large and abundant river, from which the province and captainship thus called in the kingdom of Brazil, are named. It rises in the immense plain of Pernambuco, and has its mouth of difficult entrance for vessels ; and on the s. side of the same is the castle of Tres Reyes, which was built by Feliciano Coello de Carvallo in 1601.

It is of a very poor soil, but has, besides the parish church, some convents of the religious orders of St. Francisco, St. Domingo, La Merced, and a college, which belonged to the Jesuits. It had formerly some olive groves, and the natives, findthe great profit to be derived from the oil, economise the use of it amongst themselves, to such a degree, as even to use candles instead of lamps  R 1 O    in their church ; but, since this practice, whether it may have been through the displeasure of heaven, or other reason, we know not, not a vestige of an olivetree remains.

==[[Roatan|ROATAN|Rattan]]==, an island of the N.

Notwithstanding this, the port is the best that is known, capable of containing 500 vessels, which may lie in it with perfect security. This island is covered with woods, enjoys a very healthy climate, and is not so warm as that of Jamaica, as it is refreshed by a pleasing cool air when the wind is in the e. It abounds in excellent water, in wild boars, dainos, ducks, pigeons, and parrots; and on its coast are found tortoises, and all kinds of fish. Here are also cocoanuts, wild figs, and excellent grapes; but it is infested with a species of snakes, which are here called contravandistas, as thick as a man's body, from 12 to 14 foot long, with an immense mouth, and which, when extended along the ground, have the appearance of the trunk of a large tree which may have lain some time on the ground and become covered with mire. This island was desert and uninhabited until 1742, when the English, commanded by Major Crawford, established themselves in it to protect the hewers of Campechewood, and to ensure the commerce of indigo and cochineal with the Spaniards of Guatemala. In the s. part are some ports, amongst the which is Port Royal, the larger, and that called Del Norte, defended by a coast of rocks, and, besides these, some little channels fit for small vessels. This island may be considered the key of the Bay of Honduras, and the focus of the commerce of the neighbouring provinces. In the w. part of it are some meadows in which breed mules, and of these meadows consists the greater part of its territory. In lat. 16° 23' n. long. 86° 45' w.

ROC  on the coast of the province and government of Venezuela in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada: they are about 90 miles n. w. from the island of Tortuga, stretching about 23 miles from the e. to the w. and 10 from n. to s. 
The most northern of these islands is the most worthy of note, from a lofty mountain of white stone which it has at the w. extremity, and is discovered at a great distance. On the s. side is a fountain of fresh water, but with a sulphureous taste, which makes it disagreeable to the palate. The centre of this island is low, and covered with a long grass, in which are found to breed many small birds, but which lay very large eggs. The e. extremity is full of trees, and the territory covered with a minute sand, the same being inundated at the high sea tides. The port is in the centre, in the s. part. 
The other islands are low, and that which is closest to the one above spoken of, is very small, a flat, without trees, and producing nothing but grass. At one league from this are two other, at 200 yards distant from each other, and the canal dividing them being of sufficient depth for large vessels. Both these islands are full of mangles, since the soil is very low, and constantly swamped. 
The navigation amongst these islands is made easily, though from w. to s. as the winds constantly blow from e. and n. raising a high sea. Towards the s. the waters are more quiet, and here, close to the shore, there is no bottom to be found, save at 100 feet deep. The mangroves which grow in these islands are of three different kinds, black, red, and white. The first is the largest sort, nearly as big as the European oak, and of 20 feet in height. Its wood is in great request, but of little use for building. The second grows ordinarily on the coast, and on the shore of the rivers, is not so thick as the other, but has many roots, which rise out of the ground to the height of six, eight, or 10 feet, terminating in one trunk or body, so that it is impossible to walk where these trees are ; as their branches are so thick and intertwined. The wood of the last mentioned is strong, and useful for many purposes ; and in the inner part of its core it is red. The third sort does not grow so high as the others, and its wood is of little use. These islands are situate in long. 66° 45' w. lat. 11° 55' n.

These habiliments are put on, however, as fancy or convenience suggests, and they will sometimes proceed to the chase in the severest frost, covered only with the slightest of them. Their headdresses are composed of the feathers of the swan, the eagle, and other birds: the teeth, horns, and claws, of different animals, are also the occasional ornaments of the head and neck. Their hair, however arranged, is always besmeared with grease. The making of every article of dress is a female occupation ; and the women, though by no means inattentive td the decoration of their own persons, appear to have a still greater degree of pride in attending to the appearances of the men, whose faces are painted with more care than those of the women. 
The female dress is formed of the same materials as those of the other sex, but of a different make and arrangement : their shoes are commonly plain, and their leggins gartered beneath the knees ; the coat or body covering falls down to the middle of the leg, and is fastened over the shoulders with cords, a flap or cape turningdown about eight inches, both before and behind, and agreeably ornamented with quillwork and fringe ; the bottom is also fringed, and fancifully painted as high as the knee ; as it is very loose, it is enclosed round the waist with a stiff belt  decorated with tassels, and fastened behind ; the arms are covered to the wrist, with detached sleeves, which are sewed as far as the bend of the arm ; from thence they are drawn up to the neck, and the corners of them fall down behind, as low as the waist. The cap, when they wear one, consists of a certain quantity of leather or cloth, sewed at one end, by which means it is kept on the head, and, hanging down the back, is fastened to the belt as well as under the chin. The upper garment is a robe like that worn by the men. Their hair is divided on the crown, and tied behind, or sometimes fastened in large knots over the ears. They are fond of European articles, and prefer them to their own native commodities. Their ornaments consist, in common with all savages, in bracelets, rings, and similar baubles. Some of the women tattoo three perpendicular lines, which are sometimes double ; one from the centre of the chin to that of the under lip, and one parallel on either side to the corner of the mouth. 
Of all the nations which I have seen on this continent, the Knisteneaux women (says Mr. Mackenzie) are the most comely. Their figure is generally well proportioned, and the regularity of their features would be acknowledged by the more civilized people of Europe : their complexion has less of that dark tinge which is common to those savages who have less cleanly habits. 
These people are, in general, subject to few disorders ; the lues venerea, however, is a common complaint, but cured by the application of simples, with whose virtues they appear to be well acquainted : they are also subject to fluxes and pains in the breast, which some have attributed to the very cold and keen air which they inhale ; but these complaints must frequently proceed from their immoderate indulgence in fat meat at their feasts, particularly when they have been preceded by long fasting. 
They are naturally mild and affable, as well as just in their dealings, not only among themselves but with strangers : they are also generous and hospitable, and goodnatured in the extreme, except when their nature is perverted by the inflammatory influence of spirituous liquors. To their children they are indulgent to a fault ; the father, though he assumes no command over them, is ever anxious to instruct them in all the preparatory qualifications for war and hunting ; while the mother is equally attentive to her daughters, in teaching them every thing that is considered as necessary to their character and]  

ROCKY MOUNTAINS.  [situation. It does not appear that the husband makes any distinction between the children of his wife, though they may be the offspringof different fathers. Illegitimacy is only attached to those who are born before their mothers have cohabited with any man by the title of husband. 
It does not appear that chastity is considered by them as a virtue ; or that fidelity is believed to be essential to the happiness of a wedded life : though it sometimes happens, that the infidelity of the wife is punished by the husband with the loss of her hair, nose, and perhaps life : such severity proceeds from its having been practised without his permission ; for a temporary interchange of wives is not uncommon, and the offer of their persons is considered as a necessary part of the hospitality due to strangers. 
When a man loses his wife, it is considered as a duty to marry her sister, if she has one ; or he may, if he pleases, have them both at the same time. 
It will appear from the fatal consequences we have repeatedly imputed to the use of spirituous liquors, that we more particularly considered these people as having been, morally speaking, great sufferers from their communication with the subjects of civilized nations ; at the same time they were not, in a state of nature, without their vices, and some of them of a kind which is the most abhorrent to cultivated and reflecting man. We shall only observe, that incest and bestiality are among them. 
When a young man marries, he immediately goes to live with the father and mother of his wife, who treat him, nevertheless, as a perfect stranger, until after the birth of his first child ; he then attaches himself more to them than his own parents, and his wife no longer gives him any other denomination than that of the father of her child. 
The profession of the men is war and hunting, and the more active scenes of their duty are the field of battle, and the chase in the woods : they also spear fish ; but the management of the nets is left to the women. The females of this nation are in the same subordinate state with those of all other savage tribes ; but the severity of their labour is much diminished by their situation on the banks of lakes and rivers, where they employ canoes. In the winter, when the waters are frozen, they make their journeys, which are never of any great length, with sledges drawn by dogs. They are, at the same time, subject to every kind of domestic drudgery; they dress the leather, make the clothes and shoes, weave the nets, col-  lect wood, erect the tents, fetch water, and perform every culinary service ; so that when the duties of maternal care are added, it will appear that the life of these women is an uninterrupted succession of toil and pain. This, indeed, is the sense they entertain of their own situation ; and, under the influence of that sentiment, they are sometimes known to destroy their female children, to save them from the miseries which they themselves have suffered : they also have a ready way, by the use of certain simples, of procuring abortion, which they sometimes practise, from their hatred of the father, or to save themselves the trouble which children occasion ; and it has been credibly asserted, that this unnatural act is repeated without any injury to the health of the women who perpetrate it. 
The funeral rites begin, like all other solemn ceremonials, with smoking, and are concluded by a feast. The body is dressed in the best habiliments possessed by the deceased, or his relations^ and is then deposited in a grave lined with branches ; some domestic utensils are placed on it, and a kind of canopy erected over it. During this ceremony great lamentations are made, and if the departed person is very much regretted, the near relations cut off their hair, pierce the fleshy part of their thighs and arms with arrows, knives, &c. and blacken their faces with charcoal. If they have distinguished themselves in war, they are sometimes placed upon scaffolding; and we have been informed that women, as in the East, have been known to sacrifice themselves to the manes of their husbands. The whole of the property belonging to the departed person is destroyed, and the relations take in exchange for the wearing apparel any rags that will cover their nakedness. The feast bestowed on the occasion, which is, or at least used to be, repeated annually, is accompanied with eulogiums on the deceased, and without any acts of ferocity. On the tomb are carved, or painted, the symbols of his tribe, which are taken from the different animals of the country. 
Many and various are the motives which induce a savage to engage in war. To prove his courage, or to revenge the death of his relations, or some of his tribe, by the massacre of an enemy. If the tribe feel themselves called upon to go to war, the elders convene the people, in order to know the general opinion. If" it be for war, the chief publishes his intention to smoke in the sacred stem at a certain period, to which solemnity meditation and fasting are required as preparatory ceremonials. When the people are thus] x x 2   ROCKY MOUNTAINS.  
[assembled, and the meeting sanctified by the custom of smoking-, the chief enlarges on the causes which have called them together, and the necessity of the measures proposed on the occasion. 
He then invites those who are willing to follow him, to smoke out of the sacred stem, which is considered as the token of enrolment ; and if it should be the general opinion, that assistance is necessary, others are invited, with great formality, to join them. Every individual who attends these meetings brings something with him as a token of his warlike intentions, or as an object of sacrifice, which, when the assembly dissolves, is suspended from poles near the place of council. 
They have frequent feasts, and particular circumstances never fail to produce them ; such as a tedious illness, long fasting, &c. On these occasions it is usual for the person who means to give the entertainment to announce his design, on a certain day, of opening the medicine bag, and smoking out of his sacred stem. This declaration is considered as a sacred vow that cannot be broken. There are also stated periods, such as the spring and autumn, when they engage in very long and solemn ceremonies. On these occasions dogs are offered as sacrifices, and those which are very fat and milkwhite are preferred. They also make large offerings of their property, whatever it may be. The scene of these ceremonies is in an open enclosure on the bank of a river or lake, and in the most conspicuous situation, in order that such as are passing along, or travelling, may be induced to make their offerings. There is also a particular custom among them, that, on these occasions, if any of the tribe, or even a stranger, should be passing by, and be in real want of any thing that is displayed as an offering, he has a right to take it, so that he replaces it with some article he can spare, though it be of far inferior value ; but to take or touch any thing wantonly is considered as a sacrilegious act, and highly insulting to the great Master of Life, to use their own expression, who is the sacred object of their devotion. 
The scene of private sacrifice is the lodge of the person who performs it, which is prepared for that purpose by removing every thing out of it, and spreading green branches in every part. The fire and ashes are also taken away. A new hearth is made of fresh earth, and another fire is lighted. The owner of the dwelling remains alone in it; and he begins the ceremony by spreading a piece of new cloth, or a welldressed mooseskin neatly painted, on which he opens  his medicinebag and exposes its contents, consisting of various articles. The principal of them is a kind of household god, which is a small carved image about eight inches long. Its first covering is of down, over which a piece of birch bark is closely tied, and the whole is enveloped in several folds of red and blue cloth. This little figure is an object of the most pious regard. The next article is his warcap, which is decorated with the feathers and plumes of scarce birds, beavers, and eagles' claws, &c. There is also suspended from it a quill or feather for every enemy whom the owner of it has slain in battle. The remaining contents of the bag are, a piece of Brazil tobacco, several roots and simples, which are in great estimation for their medicinal qualities, and a pipe. These articles being all exposed, and the stem resting upon two forks, as it must not touch the ground, the master of the lodge sends for the person he most esteems, who sits down opposite to him ; the pipe is then filled and fixed to the stem. A pair of wooden pincers is provided to put the fire in the pipe, and a doublepointed pin, to empty it of the remnant of tobacco which is not consumed. This arrangement being made, the men assemble, and sometimes the women are allowed to be humble spectators, while the most religious awe and solemnity pervade the whole. The Michiniwais, or assistant, takes up the pipe, lights it, and presents it to the officiating person, who receives it standing, and holds it between both his hands. He then turns himself to the East, and draws a few whiffs, which he blows to that point. The same ceremony he observes to the other three quarters, with his eyes directed upwards during the whole of it. He holds the stem about the middle between the three first fingers of both hands, and raising them upon a line with his forehead, he swings it three times round from the East, with the sun, when, after pointing and balancing it in various directions, he reposes it on the forks : he then makes a speech to explain the design of their being called together, which concludes with an acknowledgment of past mercies, and a prayer for the continuance of them, from the Master of Life. He then sits down^ and the whole company declare their approbation and thanks by uttering the word ho! with an emphatic prolongation of the last letter. The Michiniwais then takes up the pipe, and holds it to the mouth of the officiating person, who, after smoking three whiffs out of it, utters a short prayer, and then goes round with it, taking his course from e. to w., to every person present, who indivi-J

[dually says something to him on the occasion ; and thus the pipe is generally smoked out : when, after turning it three or four times round his head, he drops it downwards, and replaces it in its original situation. He then thanks the company for their attendance, and wishes them, as well as the whole tribe, health and long life. 
These smoking rites precede every matter of great importance, with more or less ceremony, but always with equal solemnity. The utility of them will appear from the following relation : 
If a chief is anxious to know the disposition of his people towards him, or if he wishes to settle any difference between them, he announces his intention of opening his medicinebag, and smoking in his sacred stem ; and no man who entertains a grudge against any of the party thus assembled can smoke with the sacred stem ; as that ceremony dissipates all differences, and is never violated. 
No one can avoid attending on these occasions : but a person may attend and be excused from assisting at the ceremonies, by acknowledging that he has not undergone the necessary purification. The having cohabited with his wife, or any other woman, within 24 hours preceding the ceremony, renders him unclean, and consequently disqualifies him from performing any part of it. If a contract is entered into and solemnized by the ceremony of smoking, it never fails of being faithfully fulfilled. If a person, previous to his going on a journey, leaves the sacred stem as a pledge of his return, no consideration whatever will prevent him from executing his engagement. It is however to be lamented, that of late there is a relaxation of the duties originally attached to these festivals. 
The chief, when he proposes to make a feast, sends quills, or small pieces of wood, as tokens ' of invitation to such as he wishes to partake of it. At the appointed time the guests arrive, each bringing a dish or platter, and a knife, and take their seats on each side of the chief, who receives them sitting, according to their respective ages. The pipe is then lighted, and he makes an equal division of every thing that is provided. While the company are enjoying their meal, the chief sings, and accompanies his song with the tambourine, or shishiquoi, or rattle. The guest who has first eaten his portion is considered as the most distinguished person : if there should be any who cannot finish the whole of their mess, they endeavour to prevail on some of their friends to eat it for them, who are rewarded for their assistance with ammunition and tobacco. It is  proper also to remark, that at these feasts a small quantity of meat or drink is sacrificed before they begin to eat, by throwing it into the fire, or on the earth. 
These feasts differ according to circumstances; sometimes each man's allowance is no more than he can dispatch in a couple of hours : at other times the quantity is sufficient to supply each of them with food for a week, though it must be devoured in a day. On these occasions it is very difficultto procure substitutes, and the whole must be eaten whatever time it may require. At some of these entertainments there is a more rational arrangement, when the guests are allowed to carry home with them the superfluous part of their portions. Great care is always taken that the bones may be burned, as it would be considered a profanation were the dogs permitted to touch them. 
The public feasts are conducted in the same manner, but with some additional ceremony. Several chiefs officiate at them, and procure the necessary provisions, as well as prepare a proper 
Elace of reception for the numerous company, [ere the guests discourse upon public topics, repeat the heroic deeds of their forefathers, and excite the rising generation to follow their example. The entertainments on these occasions consist of dried meats, as it would not be practicable to dress a sufficient quantity of fresh meat for such a large assembly; though the women and children are excluded. 
Similar feasts used to be made at funerals, and annually, in honour of the dead ; but they have been, for some time, growing into disuse. 
The women, who are forbidden to enter the places sacred to these festivals, dance and sing around them, and sometimes beat time to the music within ; which forms an agreeable contrast. 
With respect to their divisions of time, they compute the length of their journeys by the number of nights passed in performing them ■ and they divide the year by their own succession of moons. In this calculation, however, they are not altogether correct, as they cannot account for odd days. 
The names which they give to the moons, are descriptive of the several seasons, and are as follows : — 
May, - - Frog Moon. 
June, - - The Moon in which birds begin to lay their eggs. July, - - The Moon when birds cast their feathers.]

These people know the medicinal virtues of many herbs and simples, and apply the roots of plants and the bark of trees with success. But conjurors, who monopolise the medical science, find it necessary to blend mystery with their art, and do not communicate their knowledge. Their materia medica they arlminster in the form of purges and clysters ; but the remedies and surgical operations are supposed to derive much of their effect from magic and incantation. When a blister rises in the foot from the frost, the chafing of the shoe, &c. they immediately open it, and apply the heated blade of a knife to the part, which, painful as it may be, is found to be efficacious. A sharp flint serves them as a lancet for letting blood, as well as for scarification in bruises and swellings. For sprains, the dung of an animal just killed is considered as the best remedy. They are very fond of European medicines, though they are ignorant of their application : and those articles form an inconsiderable part of the European traffic with them. 
Among their various superstitions, they believe that the vapour which is seen to hover over moist and swampy places, is the spirit of some person lately dead. They also fancy another spirit, which appears in the shape of a man, upon the trees near the lodge of a person deceased, whose property has not been interred with him. He is represented as bearing a gun in his hand, and it is believed that he does not return to his rest, until the property that has been withheld from the grave has been sacrificed to it.

Some account of the Chepewyan or Chepawas Indians. 
They are a numerous people, who consider the country between the parallels of lat. 60° and 65° n. and long. 100° to 110° w. as their lands or home. They speak a copious language, which is very difficult to be attained. 
It is not possible to form any just estimate of their numbers, but it is apparent, nevertheless, that they are by no means proportionate to the vast extent of their territories, which may, in some degree, be attributed to the ravages of the smallpox, which are more or less evident throughout this part of the continent. 
The notion which these people entertain of the creation, is of a very singular nature. They believe that, at the first, the globe was one vast and entire ocean, inhabited by no living creature, except a mighty bird, whose eyes were fire, whose glances were lightning, and the clapping of whose wings was thunder. On his descent to the ocean, and touching it, the earth instantly arose, and remained on the surface of the waters. This omnipotent bird then called forth all thevariety of animals from the earth, except the Chepewyans, who were produced from a dog ; and this circumstance occasions their aversion to the flesh of that animal, as well as the people who eat it. This extraordinary tradition proceeds to relate, that the great bird, having finished his work, made an arrow, which was to be preserved with great care, and to remain untouched; but that the Chepewyans were so devoid of understanding, as to carry it away, and the sacrilege so enraged the great bird, that he has never since appeared. 
They have also a tradition among them, that] 

TE Y  ROCKY ISLANDS.  
[they originally came from another country, inhabited by very wicked people, and had traversed a great lake which was narrow, shallow, and full of islands, where they had suffered great misery, it being always winter, with ice and deep snow. At the Coppermine River, where they made the first land, the ground was covered with copper, over which a body of earth had since been collected, to the depth of a man's height. They believe also, that in ancient times their ancestors lived till their feet were worn out with walking, and their throats with eating. They describe a deluge, when the waters spread over the whole earth, except the highest mountains, on the tops of which they preserved themselves. They believe, that immediately after their death, they pass into another world, where they arrive at a large river, on which they embark in a stone canoe, and that a gentle current bears them on to an extensive lake, in the centre of which is a most beautiful island; and that, in the view of this delightful abode, they receive that judgment for their conduct during life, which terminates their final state and unalterable allotment. If thengood actions are declared to predominate, they are landed upon the island, where there is to be no end to their happiness ; which, however, according to their notions, consists in an eternal enjoyment of sensual pleasure, and carnal gratification. But if there be bad actions to weigh down the balance, the stone canoe sinks at once, and leaves them up to their chins in the water, to behold and regret the reward enjoyed by the good, and eternally struggling, but with unavailing endeavours, to reach the blissful island, from which they are excluded for ever. 
They have some faint notions of the transmigration of the soul ; so that if a child be born with teeth, they instantly imagine, from its premature appearance, that it bears a resemblance to some person who had lived to an advanced period, and that he has assumed a renovated life, with these extraordinary tokens of maturity. 
The Chepewyans are sober, timorous, and vagrant, with a selfish disposition, which has sometimes created suspicions of their integrity. Their stature has nothing remarkable in it ; but though they are seldom corpulent, they are sometimes robust. Their complexion is swarthy ; their features coarse, and their hair lank, but not always of a dingy black, nor have they universally the piercing eye, which generally animates the Indian countenance. The women have a more agreeable aspect than the men, but their gait is awkward, which proceeds from their being ac-  customed nine months in the year to travel on snowshoes, and drag sledges of a weight from two to 400 pounds. They are very submissive to their husbands, who have, ho ;- ever, their fits of jealousy; and, for very trifling causes, treat them with such cruelty as sometimes to occasion their death. They are frequently objects of traffic ; and the father possesses the right of disposing of his daughter. They do not, however, sell them as slaves, but as companions to those who are supposed to live more comfortably than themselves. The men in general extract their beards, though some of them are seen to prefer a bushy, black beard, to a smooth chin. They cut their hair in various forms, or leave it in a long natural flow, according as their caprice or fancy suggests. The women always wear it in a great length, and some of them are very attentive to its arrangement. If they at any time appear despoiled of their tresses, it is to be esteemed a proof of the husband's jealousy, and is considered as a severer punishment than manual correction. Both sexes have blue or black bars, or from one to four straight lines on their cheeks or forehead, to distinguish the tribe to which they belong. These marks are either tatooed, or made by drawing a thread, dipped in the necessary colour, beneath the skin. 
There are no people more attentive to the comforts of their dress, or less anxious respecting its exterior appearance. In the winter it is composed of the skins of deer, and their fawns, and dressed as fine as any chamois leather, in the hair. In the summer their apparel is the same, except that it is prepared without the hair. The shoes and leggings are sewn together, the latter reaching upwards, to the middle, and being supported by a belt, under which a small piece of leather is drawn to cover the private parts, the ends of which fall down both before and behind. In the shoes they put the hair of the moose or reindeer, with additional pieces of leather as socks. The shirt or coat, when girted round the waist, reaches the middle of the thigh, and the mittens are sewed to the sleeves, or are suspended by strings from the shoulders. A rufl or tippet surrounds the neck, and the skin of the head of the deer forms a curious kind of cap. A robe, made of several deer or fawn skins sewed together, covers the whole. This dress is worn single or double, but always in the winter, with the hair within and without. Thus arrayed, a Chepewyan will lay himself down on the ice in the middle of a Take, and repose in comfort j though he will sometimes find a difficulty in the   ROCKY ISLANDS.  
[morning to disencumber himself from the snow drifted on him during the night. If in his passage he should be in want of provision, he cuts a hole in the ice, when he seldom fails of taking some trout or pike, whose eyes he instantly scoops out, and eats as a great delicacy ; but if they should not be sufficient to satisfy his appetite, he will, in this necessity, make his meal of the fish in its raw state ; but they generally prefer to dress their victuals when circumstances will admit the necessary preparation. When they are in that part of their, country which does not produce a sufficient quantity of wood for fuel, they are reduced to the same exigency, though they generally dry their meat in the sun. 
The provision called pemican, on which the Chepewyans, as well as the other savages of this country, chiefly subsist in their journeys, is prepared in the following manner. The lean parts of the flesh of the larger animals are cut in thin slices, and are placed on a wooden grate over a slow fire, or exposed to the sun, and sometimes to the frost. These operations dry it, and in that .state it is pounded between two stones : it will then keep with care for several years. If, however, it is kept in large quantities, it is disposed to ferment in the spring of the year, when it must be exposed to the air, or it will soon decay. The inside fat, and that of the rump, which is much thicker in these wild than our domestic animals, is melted down and mixed, in a boiling state, with the pounded meat, in equal proportions : it is then put in baskets or bags for the convenience of carrying it. Thus it becomes a nutritious food, and is eaten, without any further preparation, or the addition of spice, salt, or any vegetable or farinaceous substance. A little time reconciles it to the palate. There is another sort, made with the addition of marrow and dried berries, which is of a superior quality. 
The dress of the women differs from that of the men. Their leggings are tied below the knee ; and their coat or shift is wide, hanging down to the ancle, and is tucked up at pleasure by means of a belt, which is fastened round the waist. Those who have children have these garments made full about the shoulders, and when they are travelling they carry their infants upon their backs, next their skin, in which situation they are perfectly comfortable, and in a position convenient to be suckled. Nor do they discontinue to give their milk to them until they have another child. Childbirth is not the object of the same tender care and serious attention arnong the savages as it is among civilised peo-  ple. At this period no part of their usual occupation is omitted, and this continual and regular exercise must contribute to the welfare of the mother, both in the progress of parturition and in the moment of delivery. The women have a singular custom of cutting off a small piece of the navelstring of the newborn children, and hanging it about their necks : they are curious in the covering they make for it, which they decorate with porcupines' quills and beads. 
Though the women are as much in the power of the men, as any other articles of their property, they are always consulted, and possess a very considerable influence in the traffic with Europeans, and other important concerns. 
Plurality of wives is common among them, and the ceremony of marriage is of a very simple nature. The girls are betrothed at a very early period to those whom the parents think the best able to support them, nor is the inclination of the woman considered. Whenever a separation takes place, which sometimes happens, it depends entirely on the will and pleasure of the husband. In common with the other Indians of this country, they have a custom respecting the periodical state of a woman, which is rigorously observed ; at that time she must seclude herself from society. They are not even allowed, in that situation, to keep the same path as the men, when travelling; and it is considered a great breach of decency for a woman so circumstanced to touch any utensils of manly occupation. Such a circumstance is supposed to defile them, so that their subsequent use would be followed by certain mischief or misfortune. There are particular skins which the women never touch, as of the bear and wolf, and those animals the men are seldom known to kill. 
They are not remarkable for their activity as hunters, which is owing to the ease with which they snare deer and spear fish; and these occupations are not beyond the strength of their old men, women, and boys : so that they participate in those laborious occupations, which their neighbours, are confined to the women. They make war on the Esquimaux, who cannot resist their superior numbers, and put them to death ; as it is a principle with them never to make prisoners. At the same time they tamely submit to the Knisteneaux, who are not so numerous as themselves, when they treat them as enemies. 
They do not affect that cold reserve at meeting either among themselves or -strangers, which is common with the Knisteneaux, but communicate mutually, and at once, all the information ofj t. y 2   
M.  ROCKY ISLANDS.  
[which they are possessed. Nor are they roused like them from an apparent torpor to a state off great activity. They are consequently more uniform in this respect, though they are of a very persevering disposition when their interest is concerned. 
As these people are not addicted to spirituous liquors, they have a regular and uninterrupted use of their understanding, which is always directed to the advancement of their own interest ; and this disposition, as may be readily imagined, sometimes occasions them to be charged with fraudulent habits. They will submit with patience to the severest treatment, when they are conscious they deserve it, but will never forget nor forgive any wanton or unnecessary rigour. A moderate conduct is never found to fail, nor is it too much, perhaps, to assert, that they are, altogether, the most peaceable tribe of Indians known in N. America. 
There are conjurors and highpriests among them, who certainly operate in an extraordinary manner on the imaginations of the people in the cure of disorders. Their principal maladies are, the rheumatic pains, the flux and consumption. The venereal complaint is very common ; but though its progress is slow, it gradually undermines the constitution, and brings on premature decay. They have recourse to superstition for their cure, and charms are their only remedies, except the bark of the willow, which, being burned and reduced to powder, is strewed upon green wounds and ulcers, and places contrived for promoting perspiration. Of the use of simples and plants they have no knowledge; nor can it be expected, as their country does not produce them. 
Though they have enjoyed so long an intercourse with Europeans, their country is so barren, as not to be capable of producing the ordinary necessaries naturally introduced by such a communication ; and they continue, in a great measure, their own inconvenient and awkward modes of taking their game, and preparing it when taken. Sometimes they drive the deer into the small lakes, where they spear them, or force them into enclosures, where the bow and arrow are employed against them. These animals are also taken in snares made of skin. In the former instance, the game is divided among those who have been engaged in the pursuit of it. In the latter, it is considered as private property ; nevertheless, any unsuccessful hunter passing by, may take a deer so caught, leaving the head, skin, and saddle, for the owner. Thus, though  they have no regular government, as every man is lord in his own family, they are influenced, more or less, by certain principles, which conduce to their general benefit. 
In their quarrels with each other, they very rarely proceed to a greater degree of violence than is occasioned by blows, wrestling, and pulling of the hair ; while their abusive language consists in applying the name of the most offensive animal to the object of their displeasure, and adding the term ugly, and chiay, or stillborn. This name is also applicable to the foetus of an animal when killed, which is considered as one of the greatest delicacies. 
Their arms and domestic apparatus, in addition to the articles procured from Americans, are spears, bows and arrows, fishingnets, and lines made of green deerskin thongs. They have also nets for taking the beaver as he endeavours to escape from his lodge when it is broken open. It is set in a particular manner for the purpose, and a man is employed to watch the moment when he enters the snare, or he would soon cut his way through it. He is then thrown upon the ice, where he remains as if he had no life in him. 
The snowshoes are of a very superior workmanship. The inner part of their frame is straight, the outer one is curved, and it is pointed at both ends, with that in front turned up. They are also laced with great neatness with thongs made of deerskin. The sledges are formed of thin slips of board turned up also in front, and are highly polished with crooked knives, in order to slide along with facility. Closegrained wood is, on that account, the best; but their's are made of the red or swamp spruce firtree. 
The country, which these people claim as their land, has a very small quantity of earth, and produces little or no wood or herbage. Its chief vegetable substance is the moss, on which their deer feed ; and a kind of rockmoss, which, in times of scarcity, preserves the lives of the natives. When boiled in water, it dissolves into a clammy glutinous substance, that affords a very sufficient nourishment. But, notwithstanding the barren state of their country, with proper care and economy, these people might live in great comfort, for the lakes abound with fish, and the hills are covered with deer. Though, of all the Indian people of this continent, they are considered as the most provident, they suffer severely at certain seasons, and particularly in the dead of winter, when they are under the necessity of retiring to their scanty woods. To the w. of them]   ROC  

ROD  [the muskox may be found, but they have no dependence on it as an article of sustenance. There are also large hares, a few white wolves, peculiar to their country, and several kinds of foxes, with white and grey partridges, &c. The beaver and moosedeer they do not find until they come within 60 degrees n. lat. and the buffalo is still further s. That animal is known to frequent a higher latitude to the westward of their country. These people bring pieces of variegated marble, which are found on the surface of the earth. It is easily worked, bears a fine polish, and hardens with time. It endures heat, and is manufactured into pipes or calumets, as they are very fond of smoking tobacco ; a luxury which the Europeans communicated to them. 
Their amusements or recreations are but few. Their music is so inharmonious, and their dancing so awkward, that they might be supposed to be ashamed of both, as they very seldom practise either. They also shoot at marks, and play at the games common among them ; but -in fact prefer sleeping to either ; and the greater part of their time is passed in procuring food, and restingfrom the toil necessary to obtain it. 
They are also of a querulous disposition, and are continually making complaints ; which they express by a constant repetition of the word eduiy, " it is hard," in a whining and plaintive tone of voice. * 
They are superstitious in the extreme, and almost every action of their lives, however trivial, is more or less influenced by some whimsical notion. They are not known to have any particular form of religious worship ; but, as they believe in a good and evil spirit, and a state of future rewards and punishments, they cannot be devoid of religious impressions. At the same time, they manifest a decided unwillingness to make any communications on the subject. 
The Chepewyans have been accused of abandoning their aged and infirm people to perish, and of not burying their dead ; but these are melancholy necessities, which proceed from their wandering way of life. They are by no means universal, for Mr. Mackenzie asserts a fact within his own knowledge, of a man rendered helpless by palsy, being carried about for many years, with the greatest tenderness and attention, till he died a natural death. That they should not bury their dead in their own country, cannot be imputed to them as a custom arising from a savage insensibility, as they inhabit such high latitudes, that the ground never thaws ; but it is well known, that, when they are in the woods,  they cover their dead with trees. Besides, they manifest no common respect to the memory of their departed friends, by a long period of mourning, cutting off their hair, and never make use of the property of the deceased. Nay, they frequently destroy or sacrifice their own, as a token of regret or sorrow. 
If there be any people who, from the barren state of the country, might be supposed to be cannibals by nature, these people, from the difficulty they, at times, experience in procuring food, might be liable to that imputation. But, in all Mr. Mackenzie's knowledge of them, he never was acquainted with one instance of that disposition ; nor among all the natives which he  met with, in a route  of 5000 miles, did he see  or hear of an example of cannibalism, but such as arose from that irresistible necessity, which has been known to impel even the most civilized people to eat each other.

==[[Saba|SABA]]==, an island of the N. Sea; one of the Lesser Caribes. It is very pleasant, and situate 13 miles n. w. of San Eustaquio, and 24 s. w. of that of San Bartolome. It is four or five leagues in circumference, belonged at first to the Danes, and, at first sight, appears an uncultivated rock. The Dutch sent to it a colony from St. Eustace, which found a tlanura sufficiently large to maintain, with cultivation, some families ; but it is still without any settlements. The fish caught on the coasts is very abundant, par icularly bonitos, which are in great request ; nor is it wanting, in general, in the conveniences of life. By the coast the sea is: very shallow ; rocks appear, for some distance, and vessels, of course, cannot come close in unless they be very small ; and there is only one small bay, which has a sandy bottom, where the inhabitants can keep their canoes. At the top of this island is a passage cut in the stone, so narrow as to admit only one person; and appearing to be a sort of natural impregnable fortification. Also, in many parts, the natives have heaped up stones over some of the passes in the rocks, in such a manner that they may, by merely pulling a string, cause them' to fall upon the heads of an enemy ; and even so, as, with one shower of stones,, to destroy an army. TheFather-Labat says, that this island is divided into two parts, which contain about 50 families and 130 Negroe slaves ; who maintain themselves by making shoes, this being their principal branch of trade; although they cultivate some indigo, and cotton of which they make stockings.

[SACO Falls, situate on Saco River in the district of Maine, five miles from the sea. The river is here divided by Indian Island, consisting of about 30 acres of land, and on each side of it tumbles over a precipice of rocks, and mixes with the tide. The prospect from the e. side of the island is very sublime and majestic. From the beginning of the falls, to the tide below, the difference of height is above 40 feet. There are many corn and saw mills ; on the falls, and below the island, is a fine bason, where vessels take in their cargoes. Salmon Falls are 10 miles above this.] 
[Saco River, is one of the three largest rivers in the district of Maine. The principal part of its waters fall from the White Mountains. Its course, some distance from its source, is s. ; it then suddenly bends to the ay. and crosses into the district of Maine, and then makes a large bend to the n.e. and s.w. embracing the fine township of Fryburge, in the county of York. Its general course thence to the sea is s. e. Great and Little Ossipee Rivers fall into it from the w. This river is navigable for ships to Saco Falls, about five miles from the sea. Here the river  is broken by Indian Island, over which is the postroad. A bridge is thrown over each of the branches. A number of mills are erected here, to which logs are floated from 40 or 50 miles above ; and vessels can come quite to the mills to take in the lumber. Four million feet of pine boards were annually sawed at these mills before the war. The mouth of this river lies five miles n. e. of Cape Porpoise. There is a bar which will not allow a vessel of above 100 tons burden to pass, if fully loaded. Without the bar, and between Fletcher's Neck and the main land, is a pool, wherein vessels of any size may lie at all seasons of the year, and take in their ladings at pleasure. 
On the w. side of the river a small neck of land divides it from the pool, which might be easily cut, and so save the hazard of passing the bar. On the branches of this river, as well as on the main stream, are a great many mills and valuable works : 25 miles from the sea a small stream, issuing from Little Ossipee Pond in New Hampshire, joins it ; and 15 miles further up Great Ossipee River, from another pond, in New Hampshire, swells the Saco, and impels its course. 
Proceeding up the Saco, its source is found on the side of the White Mountains in New Hampshire. From these mountains the waters run into Connecticut, Saco, and Androscoggin Rivers. Saco River meanders through the ancient Indian village of Peckwalket, 60 miles from the sea. In 1775, a new river burst into the Saco, from the White Mountains, and still continues to aid Saco and a branch of it, called Ellis's River. A mixture of iron ore, gave the waters a red colour for a few days, and the people on the upper banks had a report, that the river was bloody, which they considered as an ill omen to the public concerns.]

==[[Sacramento|SACRAMENTO]]==, a city and colony which was held by the Portuguese, in the province and government of Buenos Ayres ; situate opposite this capital [and 33 miles n. e. from it], on the shore of the river La Plata. The Portuguese established themselves here in 1678, but in 1680 the city was taken by the Spaniards, commanded by the governor of the province, Don Joseph de Garro. Shortly afterwards it was recovered by the former, and then, for the second time, taken  11 j  SAG  by the majorgeneral Don Baltasar Garcia Ros, in 1704, and restored at the peace. In 1706, it was, a third time, besieged by the Spaniards with 800 regular troops and 5000 Indians, and, by sea, with four frigates of five guns, named La Galga, El Xavier, La Palamo, and San Estevan : although the attempts to take it were unavailing. In 1762, however, it was again taken by Lieutenantgeneral Don Pedro Ceballos, governor of Buenos Ayres, and restored at the peace of Paris in 1763 ; and, lastly, by the same Don Pedro Cevallos, in 1777, who destroyed it by order of the court. 
It had a very convenient port, that is to say, a bay formed by the river ; the same forming every convenience to the commerce of the Portuguese, and for the contraband trade which they carried on with the Spaniards ; and in which the English were also much benefited. It was fortified with good walls, heavy artillery, and a sufficient number of troops : was also the residence of the Portuguese governor and the other ministers of the royal revenues. It was small, but wellpeopled ; and it had a pitiful appearance on account of the narrowness of the buildings. Indeed, it had no other open space than the square ; the whole of the territory surrounding it having been occupied by the Spaniards ; from whom was introduced whatever was necessary for the subsistence of the Portuguese, and for which these, who were very rich, consisting chiefly of great merchants, used to pay very dearly. [It was in lat. 34° 22" 10" s. and long. 57° 52' w.] 
Sacramento, another settlement and garrison of the province and government of Coaguila, on the shore of the river of Las Sabinas, which runs s. e. to enter the Grande del Norte. It contains 60 families of Spaniards, including 50 soldiers of the garrison ; and is 30 leagues from Monclova, to the n.

==[[Sagadahock|SAGADAHOCK]]==, a territory and district of the Bay of Massachusetts in New England and N. America; ceded by Charles II. of Great Britain, in 1634, to his brother the Duke of York, before it was annexed to the government of New York. But this duke coming to the throne through the death of the king, it became incorporated with the estates of the crown. Its territory extended from the river Santa Cruz to the e. to the river Quenebec to the w. and from each of these rivers n. as far as the river St. Lawrence, which was its n. frontier, and to the Atlantic, which was its s. frontier. 
When the French possessed Nova Scotia, Sagadahock was comprehended in its district and government, for the purpose of doing away all dissentions. In the peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the French renounced their pretensions both to Nova Scotia and Sagadahock, and the court of London recovered the right of that province : a few years afterwards, when the French established a royal government in these parts, the territory of Sagadahock still remained under the jurisdiction of the Bay of Massachusetts, and sent a deputy to the Council, though not to the House of Representatives of Massachusetts. Neither could the General Assembly dispose of the lands without the royal consent ; and the proprietorship of 3 a2   364  the particular concessions remained in favour of the holders until that they were reunited to the crown as in Nova Scotia. These establishments, however, have much varied, as having been separated from England with the other provinces which form the United States. Colonel Dunbar endeavoured to form of this territory a separate government, and accordingly obtained a royal decree to take 30,000 acres of ground, with fine trees and timber fit for the royal navy. This order was further confirmed by another of 1730, fiven to Colonel Philips, then governor of Nova cotia ; wherein he was commanded to take possession of the territory lying between the rivers Santa Cruz and Quenebec ; and to this end there was sent out a detachment of 30 men, commanded by an officer, to occupy that territory, and also a garrison for Fort Frederick on the river Pemmaquid. The end was obtained, and the troop remained there some time ; but the company of the Muscangus havjng had recourse to the court of London, and being in possession of a part of Sagadahock, the decree was repealed, and the detachment of Colonel Philips commanded to retire. In 1714, the number of men capable of bearing arms in Sagadahock did not exceed 370 ; and these afterwards diminished, through the repeated incursions it experienced, both from the French and the Indians. At the beginning of the last century, both France and England carried on an indiscriminate commerce with Sagadahock. Indeed, its territory is most fertile and worthy of cultivation ; but it is nothing more than a vast wood producing timber for building, and a great number of white firs fit for shipmasts.

==[[Saguenai|SAGUENAI|more properly Saguenay]]==, a tract of land which was known by this title, on the shore of the river of its name, in Lower Canada, N. America. The territory and shore of the river had proved so unfit for any settlement, and the first colony founded by the French in Tadousac had succeeded so badly, that they were disheartened from making any others in Canada ; until that, having penetrated as far as Quebec, they recovered spirit, and went on increasing their establishments for many years : when, in 1759, the capital fell in the power of the English. This province abounds so greatly in marble of various sorts, that even the houses of private persons are continually built with this material. [Saguenai, or Sagueny, a large river of Canada, which rises from Lake St. John, and after pursuing an e. course above 100 miles, empties through the w. bank of the river St. Lawrence, at the tow r n and harbour of Tadousac. It is about | of a mile wide at its mouth, and is    

SAL  from 80 to 90 feet deep, but higher up it is wider; and the narrowness of the channel greatly increases its rapidity, though it is navigable for the largest vessels 25 leagues from its mouth. The harbour, called Port Tadousac, can afford convenient anchorage for 25 sail of ships of war, and is well secured from all winds and storms. It is deep, of a circular form, and surrounded at a distance with very high rocks, except at the entrance. A small stream empties into it, sufficient to water a fleet. The country in the vicinity abounds with marble. 
The falls of the river Saguenay may be considered amongst the natural curiosities of this territory. They are about 90 miles up the river, are 50 feet high, and remarkable for the immense sheet of water which breaks over the cataract, and precipitates itself with amazing velocity into the river St. Lawrence, where it causes a strongeddy or current, that frequently carries a vessel out of its course.]

==[[Salado|SALADO]]==, an abundant river of the province and government of Tucuman in Peru. It has its rise from many streams which flow down from the serranias of this kingdom in lat. 24°, but principally from those streams of the valley of Calchaqui, where it incorporates with another which flows down from the s. w. and these united run to the valley of Huachipas, which name the said river here takes, but afterwards changes for that of Charomoros, from a place thus called ; and being named a little lower down the Pasage, as being where it must necessarily be passed, and not without risk, from the rapidity of its current, by those travelling by the high road from Buenos Ayres to Salta. It is afterwards called De Balbuena, as it washes the lands and fort of the settlement of this name : but before this, at some distance, it is joined by the river Piedras, which is the best water of any in the province; passes lower down by the jurisdiction of Santiago del Estero, from whence it runs 80 leagues with the name of the Salado, and loses itself about 86 miles n.n.w. of the city of Santa Fe in a lake called Mar Chiquito, [or Lake Saladas of the Porangos.] After it passes the boundaries of Salta, it turns to s. e. runs for a great distance by the side of the Chacos, or Dulce, and lastly is joined by this river previous to its disemboguement. 
Its whole course is upwards of 200 leagues, and it formerly reached as far as the city of Santa Fe, where it formed a peninsula with an arm of the Parana; but from having opened to itself some new channels from its great swellings, it runs into the lake which it now forms. It has been endeavoured to bring it back to its native bed,, as likely thus to be beneficial to the trade   with Santa Fe and Buenos Ayres by Parana, and as hindering a great roundabout journey ; but the king ordered it to be left in the state in which it was, from the numberless difficulties attending the project.

==[[Salem|SALEM]]==, a city and capital of Essex County, in the province of the Bay of Massachusetts and New England, 13 miles n. of Boston, where there is a church of very fine architecture. It is situate in a plain between two rivers, and has two forts, called, the one Winter, and the other Summer. It is where the colonies of the Bay of Massachusetts made their first establishment, and whither the port Of Boston transferred the parliament of England in 1774, when the disturbances were beginning between these colonies and the European Metropolis. This city is celebrated for its building of ships and fishingsmacks, and carries on a great commerce with the islands. The severity with which sentence is passed on  vm> ••.»<  m  S A L  criminals by its tribunal, is the cause why there are more put to death here than in all the other parts of New England. The tribunal of the city celebrates its meetings on the last Wednesday of the months of June and November. [Salem is now properly denominated the port of entry and posttown of Massachusetts, besides being the capital of Essex County. It lies four miles n. w. of Marblehead, and 15 n. by e. of Boston. It is the second town for size in the commonwealth, containing (in 1790) 928 houses and 7921 inhabitants, and, except Plymouth, the oldest; was settled in 1628, by Governor Endicot, and was called by the Indians, Naumkeag. 
Here are a society of Quakers, an episcopal church, and five congregational societies. The town is situate on a peninsula, formed by two small inlets of the sea, called North and South Rivers. The former of these passes into Beverly Harbour, and has a drawbridge across it, built many years ago at private expense. At this place some part of the shipping of the town is fitted out ; but the principal harbour and place for business is on the other side of the town, at South River, if that may properly be called a river which depends on the flowing of the sea for the water it contains. So shoal is this harbour,, that vessels which draw more than 10 or 12 feet of water, must be laden and unladen at a distance from the wharfs by the assistance of lighters. Notwithstanding this inconvenience, more navigation is owned, and more trade carried on in Salem, than in any port in the commonwealth, Boston excepted. 
The fishery, the trade to the West-Indies, to Europe, to the coast of Africa, to the East-Indies, and the freighting business from the S. States, are here all pursued with energy and spirit. A bank was established and incorporated here in 1792. The enterprise of the merchants of this place is equalled by nothing but their indefatigable industry and severe economy. This latter virtue forms a distinguishing feature in the character of the people of this town. Some persons of rank, in former times, having carried it to an unbecoming length, gave a character to the people in general, of a disgraceful parsimony. But whether this reproach was ever justly applied in so extensive a measure or not, nothing can be more injurious than to continue it at the present time ; for it may justly be said of the inhabitants of Salem at this di>j, that, with a laudable attention to the acquisition of property, they exhibit a public  spirit and hospitality, alike honourable to themselves and their country. A general plainness and neatness in dress, buildings and equipage, and a certain stillness and gravity of manner, perhaps in some degree peculiar to commercial people, distinguish them from the citizens of the metropolis. 
A courthouse, built in 1786, at the joint expense of the county and town, forms a principal ornament, and is executed in a style of architecture that would add to the elegance of any city in the Union. The supreme judicial court holds a term here the second Tuesday of November, the courts of common pleas and sessions, the second Tuesday of March and September. A manufactory of duck and sailcloth was lately instituted here, and is prosecuted with much spirit. 
The melancholy delusion of 1692, respecting witchcraft, originated in this town, in the family of the Rev. Mr. Paris, the then minister, and here was the principal theatre of the bloody business. At the upper end of the town, at a place called, from the number of executions which took place there, Gallows Hill, the graves of the unhappy sufferers may yet be traced. Though this unfortunate and disgraceful business was chiefly transacted here, it is well known that the leading people, both of church and state, in the colony, took an active part in it. Unjust therefore and highly absurd it is to fix a peculiar odium on the town of Salem for what was the general weakness or crime of the country. 
The town of Salem is connected with Beverly by Essex Bridge, upwards of 1500 feet in length, erected 1789. It is high water here,-at full and change, SO minutes after 11 o'clock. The works for the the defence of the harbour consist of a fort and citadel. Lat. 42° 29' n. long. 70° 51' a).]

Here is a village very pleasantly situate on the bank of the Merrimack, where, before the revolution war, shipbuilding was carried on to a considerable extent, which, though now much decreased, is still not wholly laid aside ; and this, with its auxiliary trades, and some little navigation, owned and fitted here, give the place a very lively and busy appearance. The continental frigate Alliance, was built at this place, under the direction of Mr. Hacket, a very respectable naval architect. It is between three and four miles n. of Newbury Port, and 35 n. n. e. of Boston. It was incorporated in 1640, and contains 1780 inhabitants. See Powow River.]

==[[Salivas|SALIVAS]]==, a numerous nation of Indians of the province and government of San Juan de los Llanos in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, between the rivers Meta and Cazarare. It is divided into tribes ; some of which inhabit the w. and others the e. of the river Vichada. They are the most docile, pacific, and well inclined Indians of any known, notwithstanding their character, in some degree, denies this assertion ; for their customs are wildly extravagant. When the time of sowing comes, all the young men go out to labour, and, being formed into ranks, receive at the hands of the old men a furious lashing : this, they say, is to beat out idleness from youth, and there is no one that ever complains of this treatment. They delighted to carry very shining arms, although they were too cowardly to use them ; and giving as excuse, that their ancestors never fought. It is the business of the women, every day, to comb the hair of their husbands, sons, brothers, and guests, to dress it, and anoint their bodies : and in this they spend the greater part of their time ; whilst the sole business of the men is to sit still, and to take care lest the operation be troublesome ; frequently looking at themselves in a mirror. They look upon it as a great affliction when their wives bear twins ; as they consider it as a dishonour to their persons. The unhappy woman, in this case, experiences the reproach of all her sex, who, without considering that the same may be their own lot, pour forth volleys of abuse, by calling her mother of mice, in as much as these animals bring forth half a dozen at a time ; and others calling her cachicamos,which animals produce more at a time, and more frequently. They, accordingly, always kill one of the children, without permitting any one to know the act ; since the husband invariably supposes one of the children to be the fruit of infidelity, and, consequently, carries his wife before the cazique, who beats her unmercifully, in the presence of other women, to deter them from the same act. The Jesuits of Santa Fe reduced this nation of the Salivas to the Catholic faith ■ but the Caribes burnt and destroyed their settlements, putting to death the missionaries, in 1684; and have frequently since repeated their invasions.

The number of sawmills on the river has neither destroyed or lessened the quantity of salmon on it. The milldams do not extend across the river, and there is a curiosity in seeing the exertion of these fish in making their way up the falls : when the sun shines clear in the morning, they are frequently seen engaged in this enterprise, moving from one rock to another, and resting on each, in spite of the cataract which opposes their progress, until they have gained the still waters above.]

==[[Salomon|SALOMON]]==, islands of the S. Sea ; called also De Mendana, as having been discovered by Alvaro de Mendana, by order of the Marquis of Canete, Viceroy of Peru, (and not Mendoza, as is wronglv stated by the Ex-Jesuit Coleto), in 1567. They are many, and the principal were named by the said Mendana, as follows : Guadalcanal, Santa Isabel, Guadalupe, Arrecife, Buenavista,  SAL  San Christoval, San Jorge, Santa Ana, San Marcos, San Nicolas, San Geronirao, La Galera, La Florida, San Dimas, Ramos, Santa Catarina, Santiago, Nombre de Dios, and Santa Cruz. 
The climate, in all of them, is benign, and the territory fertile ; and they were inhabited by savages. But they have not been discovered any further than their coasts, as none of their discoverers entered far into them. That of Guadalcanal is 200 leagues in circumference, and the best of them all ; and somewhat less than this is that of Santa Isabel, in which is the port of Estrella, large, convenient, and secure. Geographers differ about the longitude of these islands; nor is their situation justly ascertained, no vessel having since reconnoitred them ; so that they are actually, by some, thought to be only imaginary. In the journal, however, of the aforesaid Alvaro de Mendana, remitted to the king, they appear to be between lat. 7° 23' s.

==[[Salta|SALTA]]==, San Miguel de, a city of the province and government of Tucuman in Peru, founded in 1582, by Don Gonzalo de Obreu y Figueroa, with the name of San Clemente de la Nueva Sevilla, and afterwards translated by Hernando de Sesma, eight leagues from that spot, into a beautiful valley called Lerma, which is five leagues in circumference, and through which passes a river, on the shore of which the city stands, and over which is built a convenient bridge. This city, without walls, or any other defence than the valour of its inhabitants, has always defended itself against the Infidel Indians, and even rendered itself formidable to those enemies. It contains 500 men capable of bearing arms, 400 houses, a parish with two curates, and two viceparishes, which are San Bernardo and Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria, erected in 1762, as a place wherein to deposit the image which used to be in a chapel in the valley of Siancas, near a vineyard. It has four convents of religious orders ; namely, of San Francisco, Santo Domingo, San Agustin, and La Merced, and a college which belonged to the Jesuits. It is very fertile, and abounding in wheat, rye, vines, and cattle ; of the skins and salted flesh of which it makes a good trade ;  SAL  though the most considerable article of commerce is that of mules, which are fattened in the folds here, and at the sale of which a vast concourse of people assemble in the months of February and March ; and at this time there are in this valley no less than 60,000 mules and 4000 horses. The natives are subject to a species of leprosy, and nearly all the women, after twenty years old, have the coto or swelling in the throat. Notwithstanding these inconveniences, it is the ordinary residence of the governor of the province, who prefers it from its commerce and climate, to Santiago del Estero and to the capital. [In lat. §4° 17' s. long. 64° l'30"a>.]

==[[Saltillo|SALTILLO]]==, Santiago del, a town and head settlement of the district of the province and government of the Nuevo Reyno de Leon in N. America. It belongs to the bishopric of Guadalaxara, and is a necessary pass to those travelling from Durango and Parral to the coasts of the Bay of Mexico. [From the former of those places it is about 148 miles.] The same travellers must also proceed along the side of a narrow and confined port of more than two leagues, and by a place at a short distance from this, called La Cuesta de los Muertos : where dwell the nations of the barbarian Indians, the Tobosos and Gavilanes ; who perpetrate incredible murders and depredations on passengers. It is 75 leagues w. with a slight inclination to s. of its capital. [This town, which, according to Humboldt, is of the Intendancy of Durango, is surrounded with arid plains, in which the traveller suffers very much from want of water. The tableland on which the Saltillo is situate, descends towards Monclova, the Rio del Norte, and the province of Texas, where, in place of European corn, we find only fields covered with cactus. Population, 6000.] 
Saltillo, another town in the province of Tepeguana and kingdom of Nueva Vizcaya. It is a large town, and through it people generally pass into the Nuevo Reyno de Leon, as it bounds this kingdom on the e. It is of a mild temperature, and 60 leagues e. n. e. of the capital Guadiana. 

==[[Salto|SALTO]]==, Valle del, a valley of the province and corregimiento of Santiago, of the kingdom  of Chile ; thus called from a fall of the rivep Mapocho, which, running through a level territory, throws out an arm to irrigate this valley, which being much higher in the e. part than any other, causes the water of the river to form a beautiful spectacle, as it rushes down the declivities which present themselves in its course : this river then spreads itself into different aqueducts whereby to fertilize the territory, rendering the same abundant in vegetable productions in the extreme ; likewise the harvest is gathered here one month earlier than in any other part of the kingdom. In short, it is one of the most delightful spots to be found in these parts. Half a league from the capital and city of Santiago. Salto, a river of the province of Mexico in Nueva Espana. It rises in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada, and enters the lake of Chalco.

==[[Salvador|SALVADOR]]==, S. a city and capital of the kingdom of Brazil ; situate in the Bay of Todos Santos. It is large, rich, and well built, but in a territory so rough and unequal, as to render its access very difficult. Its height above the level of the sea is 600 feet ; and thus they are obliged to use machines for raising up whatever they may want. The upper plain of the city is as regular as the inequality of the territory will admit ; but the streets are straight, and of a sufficient wideness, though the greater part are at their entrance so steep as to be inaccessible for carriages : for which reason the richer class are carried about in palanquins, with curtains on each side, and carried by two Negroes. This city was founded by Tomas de Sousa, a Portuguese, near the Fort of San Antonio ; in the spot called at the present day Villa Veya or Ciudad Vieja ; and it was afterwards removed to where it now stands. Its inconvenient and irre-  

SALVADOR.  gular situation does not hinder it from being a place of great commerce, and one of the richest cities of America. It is well defended naturally, and could, at little expense, be rendered impregnable ; for it hag natural ditches, and other exterior works of fortification, such as would cause it, when attacked, to be disputed inch by inch. 
The e. part is nearly as inexpugnable, and all the other parts are well fortified by nature and by art. The approaches also are defended by various forts, particularly by that of S. Pedro, which is an irregular tetragon of earth, studded with stone, and surrounded by a ditch ; that of San Diego, nearly of the same figure and materials, but without a ditch ; the powder magazine of the same ; and another fort built in arches, and covered over in the form of a pyramid ; that of San Antonio, also of the same figure, but larger ; and the castle of Nuestra Senora de la Victoria, situate about a cannonshot from that of San Antonio ; that of San Bartolome, which is defended by a small port, wherein vessels are careened ; and those of Monferrato, and others, which command the entrance of the bay. 
From the above enumeration, it should appear that nothing more could be required to keep this city impregnable, than a proper attention to the garrisoning and supplying the above forts. But this is not the case ; as they are very badly served, a great part of their guns being useless, and the whole of the military consisting only of six companies of regulars, and even these daily diminishing, under the influence of the climate, and an irregular method of life. 
The commerce of this capital, which is very considerable, consists in linen, cloths, hats, silk and thread stockings, grain, rice, flour, biscuit, port wine, household utensils, Negroes, oil, cheese, butter, and bacon, in exchange for which it gives of its productions : such as gold, sugar, tobacco, in leaf and dust; brazilwood, skins, balsam of Copayvi, ipecacuana, and many other drugs. These articles are conveyed from the High City to the Low City in machines, at which the slaves labour ; and there are three of these to be hired publicly. The inhabitants of the higher class are distinguished for their courteous behaviour, but the lower orders are insolent to a degree. The women are more recluse here than in Portugal, and are not seen out of their houses save on Sundays and holidays, when they fo to mass, and then very early in the morning, 'his city is very rich and commercial ; the build-  ings are for the most part of stone, large, strong, and richly furnished. It contains about 2000 houses. The streets are full of Negro slaves, of both sexes, all but naked, sweating with fatigue, and groaning under the most insupportable slavery. But what is the greatest shock to humanity, is to see various shops open, filled with these poor creatures, who are exposed at certain prices, like beasts ; the masters, in fact, having the same authority over them as over animals, and treating them oftentimes with as great or even greater inhumanity. 
The town is divided into high and low, the latter consisting of a certain few streets filled with storehouses on the shore of the bay, for the convenience of loading and unloading ; and the high or upper part, which is the principal, is adorned with magnificent buildings, and, above all, with a cathedral dedicated to San Salvador, which has given name to the city, and is not only of beautiful architecture, but adorned with fine sculpture, and gilt inside and out ; enriched with crosses of gold, with candlesticks, and other precious articles of extreme value, and some so heavy as to be more than two men can lift. Opposite the cathedral is a small platform, from which you enjoy a beautiful prospect of all the bay, islands, &c. United to the cathedral is an hospital, dedicated to Nuestra Senora de la Merced, a sumptuous and wellendowed edifice. On the cathedral are dependent various parishchurches, as San Antonio, San Pedro, and Santa Barbara ; and to the n. is the college which belonged to the Jesuits, the church of which is built of marble brought from Europe ; and this, as well as the sacristy, are extremely rich and curious, equally for their choice ornaments as for their fine sculpture and paintings. Besides these temples it contains convents of the Capuchins, Carmelites, Benedicts, Franciscans, and Augustins, a monastery of nuns of Nuestra Senora de la Encarnacion, and various chapels and oratories. The palace, in which the viceroy resides, is an excellent fabric, and not less so is the palace of the archbishop. The tribunal of justice, the hospital, and other public buildings, correspond to the riches of the country ; the commerce is much enlarged by an intercourse with Rio Janeiro ; and near it are many gold mines, aboundingin this metal. The Portuguese government, contrary to the policy of the greater part of the European powers, permits no foreigner to buy the productions of the country ; and they are still more averse to any one bringing hither any foreign merchandise for    376 SAL sale. The two reasons alledged for this conduct are as follow : the one is to oblige and animate its vassals to lay aside their pride and natural indolence ; and the other to hinder the defalcation of the public revenues; which, through the system of the duties here established, are greater by an internal than an external trade. In spite, however, of all these precautions, and the penalties imposed upon contrabandists, this sort of commerce is carried on to a greatextent. 
The inhabitants of San Salvador are so much dedicated to the cultivation of the plantations of sugar and tobacco, that in some of these they employ 500 slaves ; and these they make to work so hard, and feed so badly, that it is a rare instance of any of these poor creatures enduring the service for more than seven years. The application to the above commerce causes a comparative disregard to the cultivation of other vegetable productions ; and it necessarily follows, that provisions are very dear ; the fish, too, which abounds in the bay, is in little demand, and the fattening of cattle for killing is a thing unknown. 
It has for arms, a white dove with an olive branch in its beak, surrounded by an orle of silver with this motto, " Sic ilia ad aream reversa est," the whole upon a green field, and granted by king Don Juan III. of Portugal : the same are to be seen engraved on the gates of the city, and on the houses of the corporation. 
In 1588 the English attempted to surprise this city ; but it was defended by the Indians, animated by the Jesuits, and under the direction of Father Christoval de Govea, visitor. Juan de Laetio, in his description of the West Indies, confesses that the Portuguese owe the preservation of this metropolis entirely to the industry and exertions of the Jesuits. The Dutch took it in 1623 ; but it was recovered in 1625 by Manuel de Meneses. It was erected into a bishopric by the pontiffJulius HI. and into'an archbishopric and metropolitan of Brazil by Innocent XI. in 1676. The climate is hot and unhealthy ; and the port is large, convenient, and secure, but of difficult entrance: [in lat. 12° 58' s. long. 38° 32' 30" w.~]

Salvador, S. an island of the N. Sea, one of the Lucayas, which was the first land of the New World discovered by Admiral Christopher Columbus in 1492, when he took possession of those dominions for their Catholic Majesties, Don Fernando V. and Dona Isabel, who were reigning in Castilla. The Indians called it Guanahani or Cuanabay. [It is also known by the name of Cat Island, and is more properly denominated as one of the Bahamas. All accounts, independently of that furnished by our author, agree that this island was the first land discovered by Columbus in the w. hemisphere. But if the accounts transmitted by him to the court of Spain of the natives, description, and appearance of the island were true, it must probably have undergone some very great alteration since the discovery. All along the e. coast of the island, (which is from 50 to 60 miles in length), and where he is stated to have landed, there is now a reef which no vessel of any size could venture to pass, or where any one would attempt to come to anchor.

==[[Samana|SAMANA]]==, Bay of, on the coast of St. Domingo, between Capes Francois and Engafio, near the which are some shoals of the same name, and on which, in 1724, was wrecked the lieutenantgeneral of marine Don Baltasar de Guevara, with two ships of 70 guns, called the Guadalupe and the Tolosa, which were bringing quicksilver to Vera Cruz. [This large bay is at the e. end of the island of St. Domingo. It opens to the n. e. between Cape Samana (which is also called Cape Reson or Cape Grondeur) on the n. and Cape Raphael s. e. of the former, 20 miles apart. Its mean breadth is about 11 miles, and its length 39. Some mariners reckon Pointe dTcaque, or Icaque Point, as the s. point of the bay, which comes after Cape Raphael, and is only 30 miles from the head of the bay, and lies in lat. 19° 8' n. and long. 69° \3' w. 
This bay offers a safe shelter to the stoutest squadrons. Lying to the windward of the island, it has the advantage over all the other places as a maritime post, which renders it capable of protecting the whole Gulf of Mexico, to which it is in reality a key. The entrance is difficult, and very narrow ; because from the s. side of its opening runs a breaker, which advances in a point towards Port Banister, and between which and the n. coast nature has placed the rock or shallow, called the Rebels. This rock narrows the entrance, so that between it and the land, forming the n. side, in the interior of the bay, there is little more than 800 fathoms. Thus a battery on shore, and another on the rock, the  Rebels would, by their cross fire, completely defend the entrance against even the smallest vessels ; and a battery on the other side of the Rebels would effectually prevent any vessel from entering between it and the breakers. Samana was taken by the English in November 1808. See Old Cape Francois.]

In the midst of them are some navigable channels, through the which vessels off the coast of the isthmus may pass, or lay at anchor well sheltered from all the winds. Thus these straits have ever been an asylum for pirates and smugglers. The islands in one direction are low, level, and sandy, and covered with trees and shellfish of different sorts. In some of the islands are fountains of very good water, and parts fit for careening vessels. The great channel passing between them and the isthmus is two miles wide, and in some parts four ; and extends from the point of the same name as far as the Gulf of Darien and the coast; and on this are many ports and streams of sweet water.

Sea. Its length is 25 leagues from s. e. to n. w. and its width 14. It was in former times populous, and so abundant in vegetable productions that in the port of Cherrepe many vessels used to lade for Panama, Guayaquil, Callao, and Chile, not to mention the articles which were carried into the internal provinces. Its temperature is most benign, and in nothing' differing from that of Truxillo. It is watered by four small rivers, of the which that furthest to the n. is called of La Leche. The second is that which passes through Lambayeque, and has a good bridge of wood. The third passes through Sana ; and the fourth, which runs s. is that which empties itself into the sea by Xequetepeque. They all change their names according to the different places through which they pass, and all have their origin from the serranias of Caxamarca. 
The vegetable productions of this province are many ; since besides wheat, maize, rice, and other seeds, it has all kinds of fruits, canafistola, large cocos, dates, and mameyes. Here are manufactories of barilla, which they here call lico, of which they make lye for washing; and they procure much tallow from the goats, which they buy in the province of Piura in order to fatten them in this ; and of these animals they kill in the settlement of Lambayeque alone 60,000 yearly, making dressed leather of their skins, and forming from these articles a branch of commerce,

In 1685 it was sacked by the pirate Edward David, and from that time the greater part of its inhabitants went and established themselves in the settlement of Lambayeque. In 1728 it was nearly ruined by an inundation of the river ; and the inhabitants looked upon it as a visitation from heaven, for their having sold to the cathedral of Lima the body of their archbishop, Santo Toribio Mogrovejo, who died here. It is of an excellent climate, and fertile territory. At present nothing remains of it but the convent of S. Francisco and the hospital of S. Juan de Dios, with some few noble but poor families.

[Sandwich, New, a plantation in Lincoln County, district of Maine ; containing 297 inhabitants.] 
[Sandwich Islands, a group of islands in the S. Sea, discovered by Captain Cook, who gave them the above name in honour of the Earl of Sandwich, under whose administration they were first visited. They consist of 1 1 islands, extending from lat. 18° 40" to 24° n. and from long. 154° 50' to 165° 40' w. They are called by the natives Owhyhee, Mowee, Ranat, Morotinnee, Tahowrowa, Morotoi, Waohoo, Atooi, Neeheehow, Oreehoua, and Tahoora; all inhabited, except Morotinnee and Tahoora. Besides these, the natives speak of another, lying to the w.s.w. of Tahoora ; which is low and sandy, and visited only for the purpose of catching turtle and seafowls. As they do not know of any others, it is probable that none exist in their neighbourhood. 
An account of each inhabited island wi!l be found in its proper place. The climate differs very little from that of the W. India islands in  the same latitude. Upon the whole, perhaps, it may be more temperate ; nor are there any traces of those violent winds and hurricanes which render the stormy months in the W. Indies so dreadful. There is also more rain at the Sandwich Isles, where the mountainous parts being generally enveloped in a cloud, successive showers fall in the inland parts, with fine weather and a clear sky at the seashore. Hence it is, that few of those inconveniences to which many tropical countries are subject, either from heat or moisture, are .experienced here. The winds in the winter months, are generally from e. s. e. to n. e. The tides are very regular, ebbing and flowing six hours each. The flood comes from the e. and it is high water at the full and change of the moon, 45 min. past three o'clock. Their greatest rise is two feet seven inches, and the water is always four inches higher when the moon is above the horizon than when she is below it. The vegetable productions are nearly the same as at the other islands in this ocean. The taroroot is of a superior quality. The breadfruit trees thrive not in such abundance as in the rich plains of Otaheite, but produce double the quantity of fruit. The sugarcanes are of a very unusual size, some of them measuring 11| inches in circumference, and having 14 feet eatable. There is also a root of a brown colour, shaped like a yam, and from six to 10 pounds in weight, the juice of which is very sweet, of a pleasant taste, and an excellent substitute for sugar. 
The inhabitants are undoubtedly of the same race that possesses the islands s. of the equator; and in their persons, language, customs, and manners, approach nearer to the New Zealanders than to their less distant neighbours, either of the Society or Friendly Islands. They are in general above the middle size, and well made. They walk very gracefully, run nimbly, and are capable of bearing very great fatigue ; although, upon the whole, the men are somewhat inferior, in point of strength and activity, to the Friendly Islanders, and the women less delicately formed than those of Otaheite. Their complexion is rather darker than that of the Otaheitans, and they are not altogether so handsome a people. However many of both sexes have fine open countenances ; the women in particular have good eyes and teeth, with a sweetness and sensibility of look, that render them very engaging. Their hair is of a brownish black ; neither uniformly straight, like that of the American Indians; nor uniformly curling, as among the Negroes of Africa. There is one peculiar characteristic of    SAN  this great nation, and which is also prevalent in on a high hill, overlooking Hudson's River from the e.] 
[Sandy Hook, or Point, in the township of  the friendly Islanders, that even in the hand somest feces there is a fullness of the nostril, without any flatness or spreading of the nose. This may probably be the effect of their usual mode of salutation, which is by pressing the ends of their noses together. The same superiority that is observed among the higher ranks, through all the other islands, is found here. The chiefs are, almost without exception, perfectly wellformed; whereas the lower sort, besides their general inferiority, are subject to all the variety of make and figure that is seen in the populace of other countries. Tattooing the body is much practised here. 
The natives rise with the sun, and, after enjoying the cool of the evening, retire to rest a few hours after sunset. Their instruments of war are spears, daggers, clubs, and slings. The dagger is a weapon peculiar to themselves ; it is from one to two feet long, made of heavy blackwood resembling ebony, sharpened at one or both ends, and secured to the hand by a string : its use is to stab in close fight, and it is well adapted to the purpose. They have also the knife, or saw, with which the New Zealanders cut up their slaughtered enemies. For defensive armour they wear strong mats, which are not easily penetrated with such weapons as theirs. 
The principal island of Owbyhee is nearly 20 leagues in circumference, and contains upwards of 30,000 inhabitants, under the arbitrary government of one chief.]

During the American war, the Countess Dowager of Morton erected, on the w. side of Sandy Hook, a fine monument of marble to the memory of her son, Lieutenant Halliburton, of the royal navy, who, together with a boat's crew, perished there in a snow storm. A few years ago this work of parental affection was beat down and destroyed, by the crew of a French armed ship, in a manner that reflects no honour upon their professional or manly feelings.

==[[Santa|SANTA]]==, a province and corregimiento of the    SAN  
SAN  kingdom of Peru : bounded e. by the province of Guailas, n. by that of Truxillo, s. e. by that of Caxatambo, and w. by the S. Sea. Its length is 40 leagues from n. to s. and its width from 10 to 12 from e. to w. It is of an hot temperature, as are all the provinces of the coast ; has various ports, and some well sheltered and fit for all kinds of vessels. It is watered by many rivers and streams ; and the most abundant are two which terminate its jurisdiction, called, the one, Barraifca, the other of the name of the province; and both being difficult to cross. 
Santa is one of the poorest provinces in the kingdom, and all its commerce consists in tallow of the swine, which is carried to Lima ; in the sowing of maize, and in the fishing for tollo and other fish, which they salt and carry to different parts for sale. They make here some sugar and brandy, and gather some indigo and cotton ; which, in the province of Guailas, they change for meal/papas, cloths, and baizes. At the distance of two leagues from the river of La Barranca and one from the sea, is seen, upon a small mountain, a fortress of the time of the great Chimo, Cazique or Chief, who commanded in those valleys, and who was so powerful as to make opposition to the Incas. 
This fortress is of a square oblong figure, with three enclosures or mud walls, those of the interior standing higher than those of the exterior. The greater side of the exterior wall is 300 yards long, and the lesser 200, and within the latter are various separate houses with narrow passes. At SO yards from each angle of the exterior enclosure are found some bulwarks in a rhomboidal figure, which flank the curtains. Here is also a pointed mountain by the seaside, on the top of which are three semicircular ramparts, by the land side, and which they say were the prisons of the great Chimo ; and also that from this mountain he used to cause the delinquents to be dashed headlong into the sea : both of these buildings are in a state of great dilapidation. 
This province has also mines of loadstone. Its corregidor had a repartimiento of 25,000 dollars, and it used to pay an alcavala of 200 annually. The capital is Santa Maria de la Parrilla, and its population consists of the following settlements :  
Huambacho, Casma Alta, Casma Baxa, Guarmey, Huamba, Cusmo,

The capital, a town founded in the valley and river of its name. It has been much reduced in population and importance since that it was sacked and destroyed by the pirate Edward David in 1685. It had formerly a convent of the religious of San Francisco, which was entirely ruined. It was formerly nearly close upon the coast, but the people, having at the siege gradually retreated, they fixed their abode about half a league's distance from the same, the spot where the city now stands. In 1761 it was inundated by a high tide, and it is constantly troubled with mosquitoes. In its parish church is venerated a miraculous image of Christ crucified, the gift of the emperor Charles V.

[SANTA ==[[Cruz|CRUZ]]==, a port of Nootka, on the n. w. coast of S. America, called Puerto de San Lorenzo by Perez, and Friendly Cove by Cook. It is from 7\ to %\ fathoms English in depth, and is almost shut in on the s. e. by small islands, on one of which Martinez erected the battery of San Miguel. The mountains in the interior of the island appear to be composed, of thonschiefer, and other primitive rocks. M. Mozino discovered among them seams of copper and sulphuretted lead. He thought he discovered near a lake, at about a quarter of a league's distance from the port, the effects of volcanic fire in some porous amygdaloid. The climate of Nootka is so mild, that under a more northern latitude than 3d  *m  SAN  that of Quebec and Paris, the smallest streams are not frozen till the month of January. This curious phenomenon confirms the observation of Mackenzie, who asserts that the n. w. coast of the new continent has a much higher temperature than the e. coasts of America and Asia, situate under the same parallels. The inhabitants of Nootka, like those of the n. coast of Norway, are almost strangers to the noise of thunder. Electrical explosions are there exceedingly rare. The hills are covered with pine, oak, cypress, rose bushes, vaccinium, and andromedes. The beautiful shrub which bears the name of Linneus, was only discovered by the gardeners in Vancouver's expedition in higher latitudes. John Mears, and a Spanish officer in particular, Don Pedro Alberoni, succeeded at Nootka in the cultivation of all the European vegetables ; but the maize and wheat, however, never yielded ripe grain. A too great luxuriance of vegetation appears to be the cause of this phenomenon. The true humming bird has been observed in the islands of Quadra and Vancouver. This important fact, in the geopraphy of animals, must strike those who are ignorant that Mackenzie saw hummingbirds at the sources of the River of Peace, under the 54° 24' of n. latitude, and that M. Galiano saw them nearly under the same s. parallel in the Straits of Magellan. 
Mr. Mackenzie, as well as Humboldt, have stated their belief that the change of climate observable throughout all N. America, cannot be attributed to petty local causes ; as for example, to such as the destruction of forests, &c. Their opinions will indisputably have weight in the theories of the speculating philosopher.] [Santa Cruz. See Cruz Santa.] [Santa Cruz, a Danish island in the W. Indies. See Cruz Santa.]

Great and unprovoked cruelties were committed upon these friendly and hospitable islanders by Mendana's men, for which Mendana caused two of his principal officers to be beheaded, and another to be hanged. The natives of this island are as black  stained with different colours. Their faces and bodies are tattooed. Their only covering is a leaf of a certain tree ; their ornaments, arms, and boats, are not unlike those of the inhabitants of Tierra Austral. The country is fertile, and very populous, abounding in eatable roots, six or seven species of bananas, plenty of cocoatrees, almonds, nuts, chesnuts, a sort of apple, sugarcanes, ginger, breadfruit, &c. Hogs, geese, fowls, partridges, ring and turtle doves, herons, swallows, and a great variety of birds ; and on the coast a great plenty and variety of fish. There are here no noxious insects, which are common in other islands of the torrid zone.

[SANTA ==[[Rita|RITA]]==, a settlement of the kingdom of Brazil, of which we have already made a slight as the Negroesof' Africa, their hair woolly, and mention under the article Rita, but of which we  SAN  are enabled to afford a more complete decryption under the former title, as adopted by Mr. Mawe, to whose labours we are indebted for the following extracts. Santa Rita, which is a gold washing place in the captainship of Janeiro in Brazil, and is situate about 75 miles from thence, was visited by Mawe in 1809, during his stay. at Canta Gallo, from whence it lies about five leagues, in a n. e. direction. After passing the uneven country in the immediate neighbourhood of the village, he arrived at the Rio Negro, a considerable stream formed by many rivulets, which empties itself into the Paraiba ; on crossing it, he entered upon a fine open country, the fertility of which was evident from the luxuriant growth of the tobacco and other plants : but it lay in a state of almost total neglect, and the families thinly scattered upon it appeared in the lowest condition of indolence and misery. He proceeded a league farther, through a tract entirely destitute of inhabitants, and arrived about two in the afternoon at Santa Rita. The proprietor of the works received him very kindly, and conducted him through them while dinner was preparing. The washing is in a deep ravine, bounded at one end by an abrupt hill, and open at the other to the plain. The vegetable earth appeared extremely rich, being clothed with luxuriant verdure, and the hills on each hand covered with trees of all sizes. The stratum of casealhao, which lies under a bed of soil four or five feet deep, is very thin and uneven, being no where more than two feet thick, and in many parts not more than seven or eight inches. The incumbent soil is removed at great labour and expense, being dug out and carried away in bowls ; and the casealhao is conveyed with great care to a convenient place for water, where it is washed by the most expert among the miners, in a way similar to that practised at the mirfes of Jaragua. The. proportion of gold produced was moderate. It is said to pay the master at the rate of from 14d. to 2s. per day for each Negro ; which is a large profit, as the daily subsistence of one costs somewhat less than one penny. The sides of the ravine towards the top were bare, and of different shades of colour, beingtinged by the water which flows from the vegetable matter above : in the bottom, on the surface that was yet unworked, lay some huge, halfrounded amorphous masses. In the parts which had been worked, Mr. Mawe observed two or three substances of the same kind, which being too large to be moved, the earth which imbedded them had been cut away, and they appeared like  detached nodules. On breaking a fragment from one of them with his hammer, he was much surprised to find it a calcareous substance, a solid mass composed of hexagonal crystals, with a small portion of brilliant crystals of specular iron ore. He presented this fragment to the proprietor, informing him that it was limestone ; and he also discovered afterwards that the mountains were of the same substance. 
There is reason to suppose that the stratum of limestone, below the earth in the bottom of the valley, is of very modern formation, and that, if not too thick to cut through, there might be found, between it and the granite stratum underneath, a bed of casealhao of prior formation, much richer in gold than the upper stratum. 
After having investigated these works, Mr. Mawe took an excursion of seven or eight miles, chiefly over a rich plain, abounding with the finest timber. On the margins of the rivulets which he crossed, he observed that the moss was incrusted, somewhat like the tuffa at Matlock ; and, on more particular examination, he found a stratum of tuffa in all the valleys, a few inches below the surface, which, as he conjectured, must have proceeded from the deposition of calcareous matter by the overflowings of the streams after heavy rains. The hills, even at this distance, were composed of the same sparry limestone as at the goldwashing. It is much to be wished that the value of this material were duly appreciated at the capital, where the cost of the wood used in burning shells into lime exceeds the price at which lime brought from Santa Rita might be delivered, if proper roads were made for its conveyance from this district to Porto dos Caxhes. Such an undertaking highly deserves the attention of his highness's ministers ; the benefits likely to result from it are incalculable, and the expense attending it would be trifling ; for in no part of the globe are roads made so cheaply, or public works of any kind done on such moderate terms, as in Brazil. 
This fine, but almost uninhabited district, produces spontaneously many valuable articles of commerce, which run to waste for want of hands to cultivate and gather them. Here is fbuud that celebrated variety of the palmtree, the long, serrated, lancetformed leaves of which are composed of innumerable fibres, that rival silk both in fineness and strength.] 

==[[Santander|SANTANDER]]==, New, a province and government of the kingdom of NuevaEspana; called also of La Sierra Gorda. It extends from s. to n. for more than 10G leagues, on the coast of the Bay of 3d2  SANTIAGO.  Mexico; and is bounded 5. by the jurisdiction and alcaldia mayor of Panuco and Tarapico, the town of the valleys and province of Guasteca ; n. by the province of Coaguila and the beginning of the province of Las Texas. It is 80 leagues from e. to w. from the coast of the sea to the confines of the Nuevo Reyno de Leon, and to a part of the aforesaid province of Coaguila. The greater portion of it is situate in the Torrid Zone ; but it is of a mild temperature, and enjoys a pleasant air, as also a territory which is very fertile, and abounding in vegetable productions, and particularly in cattle. It has many saline earths, and some excellent silvermines in the sierra/ and from these mountains flow down many rivers, which fertilize the valleys. This extensive country was peopled by innumerable Indians, who for a long time remained unconquered, until that in 1748 their reduction was begun by the Colonel of Militia of the city of Queretaro, Don Joseph de Escandon, who obtained his end after infinite expenses, troubles, and fatigues ; peopling 26 towns and settlements, which have not since flourished. In remuneration, however, the king granted him many privileges, and the title of Count de Sierra Gorda. The capital is the town of the same name, founded by the same conqueror in 1748. It has a good port, which was discovered in 1739, and a fort constructed for its defence. This city, had its advancement been prosecuted with the same spirit of enterprise that its foundation was laid, and every thing made of the advantages offered by its port, would have been a place of the first distinction ; although now the greater part of its houses are covered with straw.

==[[Santero|SANTERO]]==, a settlement of the province and government of Cartagena in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, of the division and district of the town of Sinu ; near the seacoast, in the bay of the same name. It was formed of different small settlements, which were reunited in this by the Governor, D. Francisco Pimienta, in 1776. 
==[[Santiago|SANTIAGO]]==, a province and corregimiento of the kingdom of Chile. It is 21 leagues long  from n. to s. and 26 wide from e. to w. It has some goldmines, which may be worked in the summer months, namely, December, January, February, and March ; but in the winter time the rains and snow, and severity of the weather, force the labourers to desist. Twenty leagues from the capital is the great mine of Kempu ; some of the metals of which are founded, and some otherwise prepared : but the working of this mine is not well established, notwithstanding it has 16 veins. Further towards the s. is another mine, with the name of Maipo, the metals of which are lowered down by engines from a very lofty mountain, discovered more than 100 years ago, and called San Simon ; and here also are the mines called De San Pedro Nolasco, which render a considerable portion of massy silver. On the e. of this mountain is a very pleasant place called Valle Blanco, where silkworms breed;. and, in the n. part, by the mountains of the curacy of Colina, are found 34 goldmines, which are actually worked, independently of 200 others which are also worked. Besides these mines there are five lavaderos, or washingplaces, in the mountain of Guindo, and some other veins in the old asiento of Tiltil. The top of Calen is covered with lavaderos of the richest gold. 
This province has also copper and tin mines, and in Lampa are three of silver and one of lead. In the small settlement of Montenegro is a vein of jasper lately discovered, which is easily worked ; the people forming of it jars, pitchers, and other articles. 
This province is watered by the rivers Mapocho, Colina, and Zampa or Lampa, and by several other beautiful streams. It also contains the Lake Pudaguel, which is about three leagues in length. It is the most fertile of any part of Chile, producing great quantities of corn, wine, and fruits, particularly peaches, which in size and flavour surpass any others of the country. 
The mountains (as has been observed) and especially those of Caren, abound with mines of gold, and that part of the Andes which is attached to it with silver. But the chief importance of this province is derived from its being the seat of the capital of the kingdom. 
Santiago, the capital of the above province, and, at the same time, of the whole kingdom, bears the same name ; and was founded by Pedro de Valdivia, its conqueror, in 1541, in an extensive valley, enclosed on the e. by the cordillera of the Andes, on the w. by the hills of Prado and Poanque, on the n. by the stream of Colina, and on the s. by the river Mapocho, called also Topo-  

SANTIAGO.  calma, and which laves the city to the n. traversing - and fertilizing the valley to which it gives 1 its name. This city was called, at first, the New City Estremadura, in memory of the native place of its founder. Its situation is one of the most advantageous and agreeable that can possibly be offered to the imagination : and its temperature is equally so. The territory is so fertile and abundant throughout, that every thing around bursts forth to render life charming. 
The streets are wide, paved, and in straight lines, forming little insular squares. The houses, although low, are convenient and handsome, and to each is a garden, which is watered by aqueducts from the river. The chief square, which is nearly in the centre of the town, has a magnificent fountain : its n. front is occupied by the palace of the president, the tribunal of the audience, the houses of the corporation, and the prison ; that of the w. by the cathedral church, and the bishop's palace. 
Towards the n. and on the other side of the river are two suburbs called, the one Chimba, the other Canadilla ; and on the «?. nearly touching the houses, is a moderate mountain, with the name of Santa Lucia ; from the top of which may be discovered the whole of the plain, which is six leagues long, and seven wide. 
It is a head of a bishopric, suffragan to Lima, erected by his Holiness Paul IV. in 1561. It has, besides the cathedral, which is magnificent, three parishes with the names of San Pablo, Santa Ana, and San Isidro ; and lately there was erected another, with the name of San Francisco de Borja, in one of the churches which was held by the Jesuits. It has three convents of religious ; namely, of San Francisco, which is that of the Casa Grande ; the college for students of San Diego ; and the Recoletans without the city, called De Monte Alberne; two convents of Augustins, one of St. Domingo, one of La Merced, and another of San Juan de Dios, with a great hospital. It had five colleges of the Jesuits, namely, San Miguel, El Noviciado, San Pablo, San Xavier, which was a house of students, with an university in which they conferred titular degrees, and called San Felippe ; and the Olleria, as a house for exercises. It had seven monasteries for religious women : the two of Santa Clara, the other two of Carmelites, one in the city, and the other in the suburb of Canadilla ; one of Capuchins, another of Dominicans, with the title of Senora de la Pastoria; another of Augustins, and a convent of this same order : also a house of recluse women, another for ex-  ercises, and another for the reception of orphans. Besides all the above convents, the religious of St. Domingo have one of the Recoletos, in' the aforesaid suburb of Chimba; and at a short distance a chapel of Nuestra Senora del Rosario, commonly called De la Vina, and that of La Merced, a college in La Canada. 
This capital is adorned by many families of great riches and distinction. The tribunal of royal audience, founded in the city of Concepcion, was translated to this in 1574 ; it was afterwards abolished, and reestablished in 1609. Here are the tribunals of Santa Cruzada, of accounts, and of the mint, wherein vast quantities of money are coined. 
The surrounding territory is delightful, pleasant, and fertile. The Indians of the country called this llanura Promocaces, which, in their idiom, signifies the place of dancing and delight, and this in order to express its exceeding beauty. 
This city enjoys the title of very noble and very loyal, a title granted to it by the king in 1552; and it has for arms a shield in a white field, and in the middle a lion rampant with a sword in his paw, and for orle eight golden scallops. 
The natives are robust, well personed, and corpulent, and the women are of particular beauty, elegance, and grace. But all the advantages of this fine province are counterpoised by the frequency with which it experiences the scourge of earthquakes ; and those, which were particularly lamentable in their effects, happened in 1570, 1647, 1657, 1722, 1730, and 1737. It was entirely destroyed by the Araucanos Indians in 1601. Its population is composed of more than 4000 families, and it has been the native place of Don Antonio de Irazabal and Andia, Marquis of Valparaiso, Commandant-General of the Canaries, Viceroy of Tremecen, of Oran, and of Navarra, and of the supreme council of state and war.

Bishops who have presided in Santiago of Chile. 1. Don Rodrigo Gonzalez Marmolejo, native of Carmona in Andalucia. He was curate and vicar of Santiago of Chile when nominated for bishop of Cuzco, to the diocese of which this kingdom belonged ; and when this was dismembered and erected into a bishopric, he was presented to it by the Seiior Don Felipe II. He erected the church into a cathedral, and governed  SANTIAGO.  it with great zeal and sanctity, and died at the age of 74 years, in 1565. 
2. Don Fr. Fernando de Barrionuevo, of the order of San Francisco, native of Guadalaxara, a man of extraordinary good life, and of great literature. He was the second bishop of Santiago de Chile, presented in 1566. He governed his church only 18 months, and died in 1568. 
3. Don Fr. Diego de Medellin, whom others call Pedro, of the same order as the former ; a collegiate in the royal college of Lima, and the first priest and doctor who presided there ; an admirable preacher, and a man of great virtues. He was provincial of the province of the 12 apostles of Lima, guardian of the convent of this capita], of blameless life ; elected bishop of this holy church of Santiago of Chile in 1574. He assisted at the council of Lima, and governed with holiness and prudence 17 years, being venerated by all. He died very poor, and was buried in a chapel which he had built, in 1593.

He accordingly sat out on his new enterprise with a squadron containing many distinguished families, to settle this new colony ; and he succeeded in rendering it obedient to him after conquering the Tupinambas Indians, who were then its masters. He then proceeded to establish many engines and estates, but the barbarians shortly afterwards revolting, killed many of the new settlers, and caused the rest to flee in two galleys, which they happened to have with them, to the province of Los Ilheos ; where they remained until the Indians, seeing that they were now without the advantages of the trade they formerly enjoyed, and the presents which they used to receive, began to repent of the steps which they had taken, and offered to the Portuguese very advantageous proposals, that they should come again amongst them.

Five miles from the island of St. Domingo, and 14 e. of that of St. Cataline.

[The island of Saona lies not much above a league or a league and a quarter from Little Palm Tree Point, to that which advances from the n. of the Saona. At each of its extremities e. and w. is a mountain, and there is a third at a point about the middle of the s. side. These mountains at once shelter and water it, and temper the air. The Indians called this island Adamanoy, and had a particular cacique, who was sovereign of the island, independent of those of St. Domingo. His subjects devoted themselves to commerce with the Spaniards, to agriculture, to cultivation of grain and fruits. They furnished enough for the consumption of the city of St. Domingo, and for provisioning several expeditions going from that port. Some Castilians having caused the cacique to be eaten by a dog, this act of cruelty became the cause of a quarrel, and the Spaniards having exterminated the unfortunate inhabitants, formed settlements on their little island. It is surrounded with banks and breakers, except at the w. part : but there is a passage for small barks, between its n. side and the main of the island of St. Domingo. The island and its port are a shelter for the mariners sailing in this part, who here find water, wood, and wild cattle, all which are in abundance. It is impossible to have an idea of the vast quantities of birds, and particularly of woodpigeons, that are seen here. The e. point of the island lies in lat. 18° W n. and long. 68° 35' a>.]

1790, when it belonged to Albany County, it contained 3071 inhabitants; and there were here in 1796, 542 qualified electors. It will ever be distinguished in history, for being the place at which General Burgoyne was obliged to surrender his army in 1777. 
This town is also famous for its medicinal waters, called the Saratoga Springs. They are 10 miles from Ballstown, in a shallow vale or marsh, in several respects resembling that of Ballstown. These waters appear to have received as strong, if not stronger, impregnation of the same kind of ingredients that enter those of Ballstown, and may be a stream of the same fountain running through the same kind of calcareous earth. One of these springs is covered over by a natural cretacious, or rather calcareous pyramid, about five or six feet high. This hollow pyramid, or cone, has a hole in the top about six inches over. If we look into this hole we see the mineral water boiling vehemently like a pot over the fire ; the water is nevertheless intensely cold, and is said to be, in every respect, smarter than that at Ballstown. The calcareous matter extends for several rods from the basis of this pyramid. There are several idle stories related of this spring ; one is, that it overflows at certain stages of the moon. This is not true. As this is found to be false, they tell you it overflows once a year ; but this has as little foundation in truth as the other. People who live at these springs think they must relate something marvellous by way of enhancing the value of the waters, and reconciling you to the great expense attending these visits.]

VOL. IV.  

SAV  State ; situate in Chatham County, on the s. side of the river Savannah, on a high sandy bluff, 13 miles from the ocean. It is well laid out for a warm climate, in the form of a parallelogram, about a mile and a quarter long, and half a mile wide. The streets are wide, and open into spacious squares, each of which has a pump in the centre, surrounded by a small plantation of trees. A great disadvantage, however, to the town, is the total want of footpaths and pavement. Improvements of this nature would render walking more agreeable, and the town more cool and healthy. At present, one sinks at every step, up to the ancles in sand; and, in windy weather, the eyes, mouth, and nostrils, are filled with it. The magistrates are charged with neglect for not paving and improving the town; but, economy is their foible. 
The houses are mostly built of wood, and stand separate from each other, divided by courtyards, except in two or three streets, where they are close built, many of them with brick, and con*- tain several shops and stores. One large range of brick buildings stands near the marketplace, and, at a distance, has the appearance of an hospital. It is the property of one person, who built it on a speculation. It is divided into distinct houses, the groundfloor being appropriated to retail stores, and the upper apartments to private lodgings. But the principal street is that called the Bay, where there are several very good houses of brick and wood. Some contain booksellers', grocers', and drapers' stores, others are private dwellings. This range of buildings extends, nearly threequarters of a mile along the town ; and opposite to it is a beautiful walk or mall, planted with a double row of trees, the same as those at Charleston, (Melia Azedarach, or Pride of India.) These trees are also planted in different parts of the town, but are supposed to be unfriendly to the health of the inhabitants. The shade of their thick foliage, however, forms an agreeable relief from the scorching beams of the sun, and they never engender or harbour any noxious insects upon their branches, which are advantages that have brought them into repute both in Charleston and Savannah. 
This agreeable promenade is situate near the margin of the height or bluff, upon which the town stands ; and the merchants' stores, warehouses, and wharfs, for landing, housing, and shipping* of goods, are built immediately below, along the shore, forming, in some degree, a sort of lower town. From the height there is a fine commanding view of the Savannah River as far} 3j?  SAVANNAH.  
[as the sea, and for several miles above the town. The river is intersected by several extensive swamp islands, which divide it into different channels. They have been converted into excellent rice grounds, as they lie very low, and are easily inundated at the proper seasons, which the culture of that grain requires. The Negroes employed in that work live on the islands, in small wooden huts, exposed to the night dews and exhalations from the marshy soil, surrounded also by frequent fogs off the water. The continual moisture and dampness in which they live, would kill a white man in a few months. In the first settlement of the colony, Negroes were prohibited to the settlers, but they now nearly equal the white population., About the centre of the walk, and just on the verge of the cliff, stands the exchange, a large brick building, which contains some public offices; and an assemblyroom, where a concert and ball are held once a fortnight, during the winter. Upon the top of this building is a steeple, and from it may be had a very extensive panorama view of the town, the shipping, the river, and surrounding country. The prospect is bounded by immense forests, and very little land appears cleared in the vicinity of the town. 
Savannah, including its suburbs, contained in 1787 about 2300 inhabitants, of whom about 80 or 90 were Jews. By a census taken five or six years ago, its' population consisted of 3009 whites and free people of colour, and 2376 slaves, making a total of 5385. At present it is supposed to be about 6000. The public buildings consist of the Branch bank of the United States, the Exchange, four or five places of worship; and a gaol, built upon the common, some distance from town. The latter is a large strong brick building, and well adapted for the confinement of refractory Negroes, and other offenders against the laws. 
A large buryingground is judiciously situate out of town, upon the common. It is inclosed by a brick wall, and contains several monuments, and tombstones, which are shaded by willows and pride of India ; and have a very pretty effect. This cemetery, though now a considerable distance from the town, will, in time, most probably, be surrounded by the dwellings of the inhabitants, like those of New York and Charleston. In hot climates, these places infect the atmosphere with unwholesome exhalations, and injure the health of the people. They should at least be two or three miles away from all habitations. But Savannah is not likely to increase  very rapidly ; for adventurers reside there as at Charleston, merely for the purpose of accumulating a speedy fortune in trade ; and then retire either to their native country, or to some other part, more congenial to health and comfort. 
The situation of Savannah, and the plan upon which it is laid out, would, if the town contained better houses, render it far more agreeable, as a place of residence, than Charleston . Its greater elevation, it is supposed, must also be more conducive to the health of the inhabitants, than the low and flat situation of the other city. Both, however, are in the neighbourhood of swamps, marshes, and thick woods, which are apt to engender diseases, injurious to the constitution of white people. Georgia, like Carolina, is subject to frequent storms, hurricanes, and inundations. In 1806, a hurricane tore up the grove of trees on the Bay at Savannah, did great damage to the town and shipping, levelled all the Negro huts on the swamp islands, and destroyed several of the Negroes. Savannah has also suffered much from fire. More than twothirds of it was consumed by that which happened in the fall of 1796. 
The exports for one year, ending the 30th of September, 1794, amounted to the value of 263,830 dollars. This city was bravely defended by the British General Prevost, against a superior force, headed by Count d'Estaing and General Lincoln. The allies made a fatal and unsuccessful attack on the 18th of October, 1779, when they were obliged to retreat, after having from 1000 to 1200 men killed and wounded. 
The road from Savannah to St. Mary's is very indifferent, and the stage goes no further than Darien; from thence the mail and passengers proceed in a canoe for upwards of 40 miles coastwise, between the numerous islands and the sea. In the spring of 1808 the mailboat was lost in this passage ; and two monks, who happened to be passengers in it, were drowned. It is 129 miles n. by e. of St. Mary's, 132 s. w. by s. from Augusta, and 925 in a like direction from Philadelphia, including the windings of the roads. Lat. 32° 4' n. long. 81° 1 V 30" a.] 
[Savannah River divides the state of Georgia from that of S. Carolina, and pursues a course nearly from n. w. to s. e. It is formed chiefly of two branches, the Tugelo and Keowee, which spring from the mountains, and unite under the name of Savannah, 15 miles n. w. of the n. boundary of Wilkes County. Its navigation for large vessels is 17 miles up to Savannah, and for boats of 100 feet keel to Augusta. After rising a fall]   SAVANNAH RIVER  
[just above this place, it is passable for boats to the mouth of Tugelo River. After it takes the name of Savannah, at the confluence of the Tugelo and Keowee, it receives a number of tributary streams from the Georgia side, the principal of which is Broad River. Tybee Bar, at the entrance of Savannah River, has 16 feet water at halftide.' Tybee lighthouse lies in lat. 32° n. and long. 81° w. and from thence to Port Royal is six leagues n. e. \e. \ 
The freshes of this river will sometimes rise from 30 to 40 feet perpendicular, above the usual level of the river. In 1701 a very destructive one occurred in part of the country; and, in 1796, a similar flood poured down the Savannah River, laying the town of Augusta upwards of two feet under water, and damaging goods therein to a large amount. It tore away an extensive bridge, near 800 feet long, belonging to Mr. Wade Hampton, which had been thrown over that river from S. Carolina, and carried destruction and dismay before it, quite to the town of Savannah. The height of this fresh was supposed to be from 35 to 40 feet at Augusta above its commonlevel. This inundation also occasioned immense damage in S. Carolina, where the waters rose to as great a height as in Georgia. Several bridges were carried away, and many of the Negro huts on the islands and swamp plantations near the coast, were torn up with the people in them, and carried by the torrent entirely out to sea. 
Proceeding up Savannah River, from the town, the sight is regaled with a variety of beautiful views. Numerous small islands intersect and divide the river into pretty meandering channels. The shores are mostly lined with large foresttrees, and the islands with abundance of small shrubs. A few plantations appear at intervals upon the banks, with now and then a handsome house ; but in general you see nothing but the Negro huts, together with many of the slaves who work upon the rice swamps : these, together with the cotton plantations, are very numerous on the banks of this river ; of the latter we shall speak towards the end of this article ; the cultivation of the former is conducted in the following manner : 
Rice lands are laid out into squares, or small fields, proportioned to the strength of the Negroes who work them, in such manner, that they can be planted or hoed through in the course of a week. These fields are separated from each other by proper banks, sufficiently strong for retaining water in the one, whilst those adjoining are kept dry. They communicate with each   other by trunks and sluices, having valves at either end to receive or retain water, and large trunks or floodgates, from rivers or reservoirs, through which water is occasionally introduced. About the 20th of March the spring has so far made its appearance as to enable the sowing of rice in the tidelands : the inlands are not planted until the first or second week in April soils are of a colder nature. Now the redflower ing maple has put on its scarlet robe, the alder its blossoms, and the willow its leaves ; the alder also shoots up its vigorous stalks from the rich land in which it grows ; and the swamp sloebush is covered with a profusion of snowy blossoms. The wildgeese and ducks have departed for the northern regions; and the planter, freed from their ravages, begins seriously to sow his crop, continuing that business, from time to time, until the 10th of June, after which the seasons scarcely permit its ripening before the frosts set in. For this purpose, the land having been previously turned up, is drilled either with ploughs or hoes, but most generally with the hoe, into about 100 or 125 trenches in the halfacre, or 80 trenches in a quarter of an acre, and rice is sown therein, from one to two bushels the acre. It is then covered, and the general custom of tideplanters is, immediately to flow the fields with water, keeping the same on from two to four days, according to the season and the heat of the weather. 
After the rice is some inches high, and attained a little strength, it requires hoeing. This is a very necessary business, as without it the plant will sometimes sicken and die. Three or more of these hoeings are commonly given to rice during its growth ; and at the second hoeing the toil becomes more serious, for the grass and weeds are then handpicked from the roots of the rice. After the operation is over, a flowing of tidelands is commonly given, and continued from 10 to 20 days, in order to give the rice a stretch, and to prepare it for branching, which it now begins to do. After this the water is run gradually off, and the rice remains dry for some time. This is a critical period of the crop, as the harvest proves good or bad in proportion to the branching of the rice, and as every branch produces one ear, containing from 100 to 300 grains, as the lands may prove productive. In dry seasons the rice is liable to attacks from a small bug, equally injurious to it as the Hessian fly is said to be to wheat, or the blast to sugarcanes. These insects attach themselves to the rice, and suck out all the nourishment of the plant. In tide -plantations this mischief is easily] 3f2    404  

SAVANNAH RIVER.  
[remedied, by opening the sluices, and flowing the fields with water ; but the inland planter has not this convenience ; patience and hope are the only sources to which he can then apply for consolation. 
Three months after the sowing of rice it begins to joint, blossom, and form the ear ; water is now absolutely necessary, for without it there is much light rice ; and whenever it can be thrown on from rivers or reservoirs it is immediately done, and is retained thereon, with a change of water, if convenient, until a few days before the harvest. This curious operation in agriculture generally begins on tidelands towards the end of August, and in September the harvest becomes general throughout the state. In August, when the rice is flowed, and, as it is termed, the hoes laid by, the cooperstuff is procured, which is necessary for exporting the rice in barrels : for this purpose, Negroes are then sent into the pinelands to split staves and heading for barrels, while others afterwards cut hooppoles for making them. Now the barns and barnyards are put in order, and the ricemill is prepared for manufacturing the rice for market. 
The produce of rice to the acre is different on different soils, and in proportion to the skill with which it is managed. On tidelands, 2400 lbs. have been made to the acre : but, in general, the produce is from 1200 to 1500 lbs. weight each acre. The inland plantations do not average so much, ranging only between 600 and 1200 lbs. of clean rice to the acre. They, however, in addition to this, generally furnish their own provisions, which is an advantage that the tideplanters seldom enjoy, in consequence of the poverty of their high grounds. 
After harvest the crop is placed in the open barnyards, either in stacks or in large ricks. It is then threshed out by handflails, and being winnowed from the straw, is ready for beating. This operation was formerly performed by manual labour, with a pestle and mortar, and is still so done, in some parts of the state ; but, from public encouragement, aided by private necessity and invention, the ricemills of S. Carolina are now arrived to a perfection unequalled, perhaps, by those of any part of the world. 
As you proceed a few miles further up the river, you frequently may see a great number of alligators of various sizes ; the largest of which are about eight feet long, and from 16 to 18 inches diameter in the thickest part of the body. T'hey may be seen either swimming along shore, with their heads just above water, or basking in  the sun upon the branches of trees which project into the river. Their colour, when just coming out of the water, is a dark green or brown ; but when dry, it resembles that of a log of wood. If you fire at them, the effect is just the same as though the bullet had struck against a coat of mail. The eye, or the breast, are the most vulnerable places. In the upper parts of the river they abound in great numbers, and of a very formidable size, growing frequently to the length of 18 or 20 feet. 
This river abounds also with a great many tortoises or terrebins, which bask in the sun like the alligators, upon the trunks and branches of trees that grow in the water along shore. They are of various sizes, and are said to live in harmony with the alligator, in the same hole ; in which case the terrebins cannot form an article of food for that voracious animal, otherwise they would fly from his presence. The variety of fish with which the Savannah abounds, affords the alligator abundance of provision, without infringing the rights of hospitality. 
In navigating this river it is necessary to keep some distance from the trees and shrubs which hang over the banks of the river, as there are a great number of water vipers reclining upon the branches. They are apt to spring into the boat, if it approaches too close, which is dangerous, as their bite is said to be venomous. Besides these vipers, the shores abound with a species of water rattlesnake, whose bite is also of a deadly nature. 
The winter of Savannah is warm and moderate, but the weather is unsettled. Trees, shrubs, and plants, are then destitute of their beautiful foliage and fragrant blossoms ; and the fields, plantations, and gardens, want their verdant crops, their gay and lively flowers. At that season we see nothing but the deep unvarying tint of pines, firs, laurels, bays, and other evergreens. The summer is too sultry to admit of frequent exposure in the open air, and the autumn generally brings with it, in the country parts, fever and ague, and in the towns, the typhus icterodes, or yellow fever. 
In the plantations, the Negro men and women, boys and girls, are alike engaged ; and each has a separate piece of ground marked out for their day's work. When their task is finished, some planters allow their slaves to work for themselves, on small gardens which are usually allotted to them. Where they have the good fortune to fall into the hands of a liberalminded man, their situation is far from irksome, and]

[they frequently know nothing of slavery but the name. In such cases, Negroes have been known to save up enough from the produce of their little gardens and live stock, to purchase their freedom, which is generally equivalent to 500 or 600 dollars. 
Cotton is raised from the seed, and managed nearly in the following manner : About the latter end of March, or beginning of April, commences the season for planting cotton. In strong soils the land is broken up with ploughs, and the cotton is sown in drills, about five feet from each other, and at the rate of nearly a bushel of seed to the acre ; after which, when the cotton is a few leaves high, the earth is thrown up in a ridge to the cotton, on each side, by a plough, with a mouldboard adapted to that purpose ; or, in the first instance, beds are made rather low and flat, and the cotton is sown therein. By some they are sown in holes, at about 10 inches distance : but the more general practice is to sow the cotton in a drill along the length of of the bed ; after which it may be thinned at leisure, according to its growth. In rich highland soils, not more than 15 of these beds are made in a quarter of an acre ; but in inferior lands, 21 beds are made in the same space of ground. When the plants are about four or six leaves high, they require a thinning ; at which time only a very few plants are left at each distance, where it is intended the cotton is to grow : and from time to time these plants are thinned, until at length two plants, or only one, are left at each distance. 
Where the land is not rich, the plants remain within 10 or 12 inches of each other; but when a luxuriant growth is induced, they are thinned to 18 inches and two feet, and in rich swamp lands, to four feet distance in the rows. At the time of thinning also the first hoeing is generally given, and the rule is, not to draw the earth down, but constantly to draw up a little earth at each hoeing, to the plant ; and to give the fields a hoeing every two or three weeks. With some planters the practice of topping the main stalk has been used when the plants are too luxuriant; but the plant throwing out consequently an abundance of suckers, and thereby increasing the toil of the Negroes to pull them away, has induced its discontinuance. Towards the middle of September, however, it may be advantageous to top the cotton to the lowest blossoms ; as from that time no blossoms will produce cotton. By this treatment also the sun has a greater influence, with the plant, the pods  open sooner, and the strength of the plant is not drawn unnecessarily from those pods which are likely to come to maturity. 
Towards the middle of June the plants begin to put forth their beautiful blossoms, and continue blossoming and forming the pods until the frosts set in ; at which time all the pods that are not well grown are injured and destroyed. Early in August the cotton harvest begins, and in September it is general throughout the state, continuing until December. The cotton wool is contained in the pod, in three or four different compartments ; which bursting when ripe, presents the cotton full blown to the sight, surrounding its seed. The cotton is then picked from the pods, and put into small bags of Osna burg, which are slung over the shoulders for that purpose, and afterwards car ried to the cottonhouse. From thence it is, in a day or two after, taken out, and spread on a platform to dry, after which it is ready for ginning. For this purpose a suitable house is necessary, sufficiently large to receive both the cured cotton, and that which has been lately brought in. When the cotton is well opened, a Negro will gather 60 or 70 lbs. of cotton in the seed in one day. The produce of cotton is various, according to its different situations and In the lower country the black seed profrom 100 to 300 lbs. of clean cotton per In the middle and upper country green seed does the like. Upon indifferent lands, only from 60 to 100 lbs. of clean cotton is made to the acre ; on better lands from 100 to 200 lbs. ; and on the best lands, in good seasons, upwards of 300 lbs. have been made in Beaufort district. The planter, however, is satisfied with from 150 to 200 lbs. of clean black seed cotton to the acre. The green seed planter expects somewhat more. 
There are several kinds of gins in use, but the saw gins are reckoned to clean the most cotton in the shortest time. The saw gins are used particularly for extracting the cotton from the green seed, to which it closely adheres. This mill is worked either by oxen or water, and consists of an horizontal cogwheel, or a waterwheel working a band which puts the pulleys of the sawmill in motion. One of these pulleys turns a cylinder, round which is affixed from 20 to 40 circular iron plates, about threefourths of an inch distant from each other, serrated at the edge; these continually revolve between iron straps into the compartment where the cotton is placed, and thus tear the cotton from the seeds,]  kinds, duces acre.  
■ -va   406    
[as the space through which they revolve is not sufficiently large to let the seeds pass through. Another pulley moves a cylinder with a set of brushes opposite each saw, which take the clean cotton from the teeth of the saw, and discharge it from the gin. One person, besides the packers and those who drive the oxen, is sufficient to attend this gin, and the cotton cleaned by it daily may be from 600 to 900 lbs. weight. 
After the cotton is thus ginned, a number of hands are employed in picking from it any dirt, or bits of seed, which may remain in it : it is then packed up in bags, weighing from 250 to 300 lbs. and is ready for market. Such is the growth of cotton in S. Carolina, and the mode of preparing it for market ; but it is not all of the same intrinsic value, as that raised on lands adjacent to the sea and saltwater, called island or seashore cotton, being black seed, is preferred to the greenseed cotton, which is raised in the interior of the country. Cotton is also grown at Berbice, Demerara, Surinam, Cayenne, St. Domingo, Tobago, Jamaica, and other parts of the W. Indies, as well also in the E. Indies ; but Great Britain has lately received her chief supplies of that article from the American States.]

This settlement of Christian Indians was established in 1772, on a tract of land granted by the Delaware Tribe. In 1775, the chapel, which could contain 500 people, was found too small for the hearers, who came in great numbers. It was situated about 30 miles from Gekelmuckpechuenk, 70 from Lake Erie, and 50 w. from Fort M'Intosh. It had a good spring, a small lake, good planting grounds, much game, and every other convenience for the support of an Indian colony. It appears that a large fortified Indian town formerly stood here ; some ramparts, and the ruins of three Indian forts, being still visible. The Delawares granted to the Christian Indians all the tract from the entrance of Gekelmuckpechuenk Creek into the Muskingum to Tuscarawi. This thriving settlement was destroyed in 1782, when the Huron Indians carried the inhabitants to Sandusky ; and when these peaceable Indians were permitted to return to reap their harvest, they were cruelly butchered by the American settlers, while praising God and forgiving their enemies. Congress granted 4000 acres of land here to the society of the United BreTOL, IV.  
SCH  thren,.for the purpose of propagating the gospel, on September 3, 1788.]

[Schoharie River runs with its windings a n. course of about 80 miles from the Kaats' Kill Mountains, and empties into Mohawk River at Fort Hunter. The w. branch of this river is called Cobus Kill. On the e. side of Cobus is the settlement of its name. The towns and settlements on Schoharie were, in 1796, as you proceed from S. to N.

[==[[Schuylkill|SCHUYLKILL]]==, a river of Pennsylvania, which rises n. w. of the Kittatinny Mountains, through which it passes into a fine champaign country, and runs, from its source, upwards of 120 miles, with windings in a s. e. direction, and passing through the limits of the city of Philadelphia, falls into the Delaware, opposite Mud Island, six or seven miles below the city. It will be navigable from above Reading, 85 or 90 miles to its mouth, when the canal begun at Norriton is completed. This will pass by the falls, and also form a communication with the Delaware above the city. There are four floating bridges thrown across it, made of logs fastened together, and lying upon the water, in the vicinity of Philadelphia. Little Schuylkill River falls into this river from the n. at Reading. On the head waters of Schuylkill are quantities of coal.] 
SCIMIGAEYES. See Semigues. [SCIOTA River, which falls into the Ohio in the territory of the United States, n. w. of the Ohio, is larger than either the Muskingum or Hockhocking, and opens a more extensive navigation. It is passable for large barges for 200 miles by its course, with a portage of only four miles to the Sandusky, a boatable water which falls into Lake Erie. Through the Sandusky and Sciota lies the most common pass from Canada to the Ohio and Mississippi; one of the most extensive and useful communications that are to be found in any country. Prodigious extensions of territory are here connected ; and from the rapidity with which the w. parts of Canada, Lake Erie, and the Kentucky countries are settling, we may anticipate an immense intercourse between them. The flour, corn, flax, and hemp, raised for exportation in that great country between the Lakes Huron and Ontario, will find an outlet through Lake Erie and these rivers, or down the Mississippi. The Ohio merchant can give a higher price than those of Que-  bec for these commodities ; as they may be trails ported from the former to Florida and the W. India islands, with less expense, risk, and insurance, than from the latter ; while the expense from the place of growth to the Ohio will not be onefourth of what it would be to Quebec, and much less than even to the Oneida Lake. The stream of the Sciota is gentle, no where broken by falls. At some places, in the spring of the year, it overflows its banks, providing for large natural rice plantations. Salt springs, coal mines, white and blue clay, and freestone, abound in the country adjoining this river. Its mouth is in lat. 38° 24' n. long. 82° 48' w. about 300 miles by the course of the Ohio below Pittsburg, and is navigable to its source in canoes.]

A millpond in this town being suddenly drawn off by a breach in the dam, in the winter season, some years ago, exhibited a matter of speculation to many of the inhabitants. The swine of the neighbourhood rooted up house swallows in great quantities, from the spot which the water had left, which they ate greedily. Swallows have been found in several other places ; at Egg  Harbour, in New Jersey, in a marshy place, a large cedar being blown down, a vast number of swallows were found in the mud of the root.] [Scituate, a township of Rhode Island, Providence County, bestween Foster and Johnston.

==[[Sechura|SECHURA]]==, a settlement of the province and eorregimiento of Piura in Peru, and the last of this jurisdiction by the 5. It was formerly situate on the coast of the S. Sea, not far from a point of land called De la Abuja; but, it having been inundated by the sea, was removed to where it now stands, one league from the coast, on the s. shore of the river Piura, which has water only when it rains in the sierra, it being then very full, and it being necessary to pass it in rafts : this river, when it does not rain, is entirely dry, so that the inhabitants are obliged to make wells for their drinking water. It has 200 houses, built of cane, and a beautiful church of brick. The inhabitants, who should amount to 400 families, are all Indians, occupied as fishermen and muleteers, and speaking an idiom distinct from that of the other Indians of Peru. They are of high stature, of good disposition, and excel in every thing they undertake ; neither are they addicted to the superstition and vices of the other Indians.  In short, they differ from them in every thing but colour, and are altogether great observers of moderation and order. In lat. 5° 33' 33" s. long. 80° 42'. 
Sechura, a celebrated unpeopled tract of the same kingdom as the former "settlement, beginning from the same, and lying in the direct road to Lima. It is an immense llanura of sand extending for more than 40 leagues as far as the settlement of Morrope in the province of Sana, the journey to which place is made in a litter. The extent and uniformity of this llanura, and the perpetual motion of the sand by the winds, which obliterate all traces of the road, have frequently caused the most experienced muleteera to lose their way ; and then the method by which they regain it is truly curious, namely, by putting their face to the wind in going, and their back when returning : nor indeed does this system ever fail, since the wind here always blows from the s. They have also a way of occasionally collecting a handful of sand, to which they smell, for the purpose of knowing whether it may contain any thing of the dung of animals that may have passed that way ; by which means they likewise regain their rout. Those, however, who are not well skilled in the travelling this vast desert, run infinite risk of perishing ; since, should they give themselves up to sleep, ■ the difficulty of again finding their right way is so great, that little short of a miracle can save them ; and many are those who have thus perished by hunger and thirst. 
Here the whole prospect consists of mountains of sand, heaped promiscuously by the winds, Avithout a single tree, herb, or green thing ; and thus the traveller must be well provided with provisions for himself, as with fodder for his horses. At 32 leagues distance from the settlement of Sechura is the river of Pozuelos, the first water to be discovered in this perilous rout. The sagacity of the animals at approaching this acceptable stream is astonishing : they scent it at four leagues distance, and, although harassed and fatigued, immediately spring forwards with an impetuosity which cannot be restrained, and, having arrived at it by the shortest way, proceed with spirits and alacrity on the rest of the journey.

The occupant of every house and farm seemed as if on the point of abandoning it, and all the buildings were falling into decay. The principal of these diamond works, according to Mr. Mawe, is at Mandango, on the river Jigitonhonha, in the district of Serra do Frio. Formerly they were farmed out, but, for many years back, the establishment has been entirely in the hands of government. The produce was mostly sent to Holland, where the stones were cut and set ; but of late they have found their way to the London market. Mr. Mawe tells us, that the establishment is still in debt to foreigners for considerable sums advanced to them on security of the produce of the mines.

Pressed at last with extreme hunger, he caught some crabs on the shore, which were his food for some days ; and then seeing large turtles which came ashore, he caught some of them. Having lived for three years in this manner on crabs and turtles, and drank nothing but rainwater which he gathered in turtleshells, he discovered another companion in misfortune, who had also been shipwrecked. This companion was some comfort to him, and they lived four years together ; at the end of which time a vessel coming near the island carried them both to Spain. The last of these died on the way thither; but Serrana was carried to Germany, and presented to Charles V. as a kind of prodigy ; for all his body was overgrown with hair like a bear, and his beard came down to his waist.

[SIX ==[[Nations|NATIONS]]==, a confederacy of Indian nations so called by the British and Americans. The French call them Iroquois. Formerly they were called the Five Nations, /five only being joined in that alliance ; but. they now consist of six nations, and call themselves Aganuschioni,  that is, the United People. Some call them Mingos ; others Maquais. These six nations are the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Senecas, Cayugas, and Tuscaroras. The latter joined the confederacy about 100 years ago. In the late war with Great Britain they were allies of that power, and in 1779 they were entirely defeated by the troops of Congress, and their towns all destroyed. They now live on grounds called the State Reservations, which are intermediate spaces settled on all sides by white people. In their present cramped situation, they cannot keep together a great while ; they will probably quit the United States, and retire over the lakes Ontario and Erie. All the Mohawks, and the greater part of the Cayugas, have already removed into Canada. The number of souls in all the six nations was, in 1796, 4058. The Stockbridge and Brotherton Indians, who now live among them, added, make the whole number 4508, of whom 760 live in Canada, the rest in the United States. By a treaty made in 1794, between the United States on the one part, and the Six Nations and their Indian friends residing with them, on the other part, it was stipulated that " the sum of 4500 dollars should be expended annually, and for ever, in purchasing clothing, domestic animals, implements of husbandry, and other utensils, and in compensating useful artificers who shall reside among, them, and be employed for their benefit." This allowance is under the direction of a superintendant, and is not distributed for any private purposes. It is apportioned among them according to their numbers, in order to which there is annually taken an exact census of all these Indians. 
In 1796, the Friends, commonly called Quakers, in their benevolence and zeal to promote the welfare of these Indians, raised a fund to support a number of their society, who offered to go and reside among them, with a view to promote their civilization, moral improvement, and real welfare. A committee of their society was appointed to accompany these friends to humanity, and they were actually on the spot, and commenced their work of charity about nine years back. The state of New York have taken these Indians under their protection, and appointed commissioners to take care that they receive no wrong from interested individuals.]

[SKENECTADY* an ancient and respectable town in Albany County, New York, 13 miles n. w. of Albany City, pleasantly situate in a vale bordered with hills to the s. and e. on the margin of Mohawk River. The houses, about 150 or 200 in number, are compactly built, chiefly of brick, on regular streets, in the old Dutch style, on the s. side of the river : few of them are elefant. The public buildings are a Dutch and a 'resbyterian church. The windings of the river through the town and fields, which are often overflowed in the spring, afford a rich and charming prospect about harvest time* 
This town, being at the foot of navigation, on a long river which passes through a very fine country rapidly settling, it would be natural to conclude would embrace much of its commerce ; but originally knowing no other than the fur trade, which, since the revolution, has almost ceased, and having taken no advantage of its happy situation for other commerce, the place has considerably decayed. The chief business of this town now is to receive the merchandise from Albany, and put it into batteaux to go up the river, and forward to Albany the returns from the back country. See Mohawk River. Union College was established and incorporated here in 1794, and is under the direction of 24 trustees. It took its name from the union of various denominations of Christians in its establishment. The Dutch were, however, by far the most liberal benefactors to this institution. It is well situated for the conveniency of the n. and w. parts of the state. In June, 1796, there were 40 students, divided into four classes, viz. 1st. Languages ; 2d. History and Belles Lettres ; 3d. Mathematics ; 4th. Philosophy. The annual expense of education here, including board, tuition, &c. is less than 100 dollars. The property of the college consists in various articles, to the following amount, viz. dolls. cts. 
Bonds and mortgages, producing an annual interest of 7 per cent. - 21,301 6 Subscriptions and other debts due on the books of the treasurer - 4,983 10 Cash appropriated for the purchase of books - - - 1,356 45

2,381  400 250  
42,422  And 1604 acres of land. The faculty of the college consisted, in 1797, of the president and one tutor ; and the salary of the former, with an house for his family, is 1100 dollars, and of the latter 665 dollars per annum, with an additional allowance at present of 250 dollars, on account of the extraordinary price of the necessaries of life. There were, in 1797, 37 students, eight in theclass of languages, 20 in the class of history and belles lettres, six in the class of mathematics, and three in the class of philosophy. The course of studies is, the first year Virgil, Cicero's Orations, Greek Testament, Lucian, Roman antiquities, arithmetic and English grammar; the second year, geography and the use of the globes, Roman history, history of America, and the American revolution, Xenophon, Horace, criticism, and eloquence ; the third year, the various branches of mathematics, and vulgar and decimal fractions, and the extraction of the roots, geometry, algebra, trigonometry, navigation, mensuration, Zenophon continued, and Homer ; and the fourth and last year, natural philosophy, the constitution of the United States and of the different states^ metaphysics, or at least that part which treats of the philosophy of the human mind, Horace continued, and Longinus; and, during the course of these studies, the attention of the classes is particularly required to elocution and composition in the English language. A provision is also made for substituting the knowledge of the French language instead of the Greek, in certain cases, if the funds should hereafter admit of instituting a French professorship. The library consists of about 1000 volumes, and £500 is appropriated to the purchase of a philosophical apparatus. The township of Skenectady contains 3472 inhabitants, of whom 683 are electors, and 381 slaves. It is bounded e. by Half Moon and Water- Vliet, and s. by the n. bounds of the manor of Rensselaerwick.] 

[==[[Skenesborough|SKENESBOROUGH]]==, now called Whitehall, is a growing township in the e. side of  SLE  [the State of New York, situate on Wood Creek, on the s. side of South Bay. It is situate in a wild romantic country, as yet but little cultivated or improved. It contains very few houses ; but its principal resources are derived from the falls in its vicinity, upon which are built some saw and flour mills ; and from the commerce carried on between the state of New York and Canada, it being the port or harbour for most of the vessels employed in that trade, and in transporting goods to the different settlements along the lake. It has, however, very bad water, and is unhealthy in summer. It is about eight miles e. by n. of Fort George, and six n. by e. of Fort Ann. The fortifications here were destroyed by General Burgoyne in July, 1777. It is only within the last 20 or 30 years, that much progress has been made in settling the lands in this part of the country. During the American war they formed almost one continued wood, containing merely a few wretched roads or intricate paths. It was here that General Burgoyne and his army were delayed (in the year before mentioned) so many weeks in opening roads through the woods to Fort Edward, which occasioned many of those difficulties that afterwards led to the capture of that fine army. It is said, that when the general found he was hemmed in on every side, and knew he must surrender, he gave permission to his officers and soldiers to take advantage of the night, and make their escape into Canada. Upwards of 2000 escaped in this manner, and went off", in small parties, with Indians for their guides. Captain Ferguson, of the Canadian fencibles, was then in Burgoyne's army, and wenfroff with his father, who was a captain in one of the regiments. They made their escape at night without any Indian for their guide, and were 43 days in the woods before they reached St. John's, during which they had no other subsistence than the leaves and bark of trees, and what little game they could pick up. 
The mode of travelling here is in a sort of waggon, common in the states, and used by the country peoply to carry their provisions to market, or to transport goods from one part of the country to the other. A great number are constantly employed on the road between Skenesborough and Troy. It is a long narrow cart upon four wheels, and drawn by two horses abreast. When used as a stage for travelling, a couple of chairs are placed in it ; but it is a very rough method of riding, for the waggon has no springs ; and a traveller ought to have excellent  nerves to endure the shaking and jolting of such a vehicle over bad roads. 
In the neighbourhood of this place the woods, in many places, have been cleared by burning the bark off the trees, and numbers of them } r et remain standing, though vegetation is destroyed. The other parts of the farms are covered with the stumps of trees and enclosed by worm fences, which give to these settlements a very rough appearance. They are, however, numerous, and contain several good houses. 
The surrounding country is agreeably diversified with hill and dale, small woods, clumps of trees, cornfields, pastures, and meadowlands. The soil is said to be fertile, and many very handsome houses and churches are to be seen near the roadsides, all of wood, but constructed very neatly with clapboards and shingles, which cover the heavy timbers. Many of the houses are built in the style of English country dwellings of the modern taste ; some of them two or three stories high, painted white, and ornamented with green Venetian shades. The churches are uncommonly neat, painted white, and kept in excellent order. They have good spires, and some of them bells.]

[SOCIETY Islands, a cluster of islands in the S. Pacific Ocean. To these islands Captain Cook was directed by Tupia, in 1769 ; and he gave them this name in honour of the Royal Society. They are situate between the latitudes of 16° and 18° 10' s. and between the longitudes of 148° and 152° 10' w. They are seven in number. 
The soil, the productions, the people, their language, religion, customs, and manners, in all those islands, are so nearly the same as at Otaheite, that little need be added to the account which has already been given. Nature has been equally bountiful in uncultivated plenty, and the inhabitants are as luxurious and as indolent. A plantain branch is the emblem of peace, and changing names the greatest token of friendship. Their morals are differently constructed, though serving the same purposes. It is customary to give their daughters to strangers who arrive amongst them ; but the pairs must be five nights lying near each other, without presuming to take any other liberty. On the sixth evening, the father of the young woman treats his guest with food, and informs his daughter, that she must that night receive him as her husband. The stranger must not express the least dislike, should the partner allotted to him be ever so dis-   s o c agreeable ; for this is considered as an unpardonable affront, and is punished with instant death.]

It is 35 leagues long from n. to s. and as many more wide from e. to w. It is very fertile in vegetable productions, and especially in cacao, which is most excellent, and of the best quality of any in America. It is, on this account, that the crops of this article are eagerly bought up by the richest families in these parts, and that very little of it finds its way to Europe. This province, of which the conqueror was Pedro de Alvarado, is watered by several rivers, all of which run into the S. Sea; along which coast it extends for 30 leagues. It is nearly uninhabited, having in it only one or two settlements besides the capital, which is called Gueguetlan.

Here it was that the Indians had their temples, extremely sumptuous, and the inner parts adorned with gold and precious stones ; the same being the deposits of their idols. These temples were one night accidentally set fire to by two Spanish soldiers, who had entered to rob them ; and, according to all the historians, the fire lasted in this settlement for the space of five years. 
It is situate on a fertile and extensive plain, of a cold temperature, but healthy, and abounding in wheat of the best quality, as well as in barley, maize, tartuffles, and other productions of a cold <^imate.

It produces many vegetables and fruits, amongst which the Chumbo figs pass for the best in the kingdom. It fabricates a considerable portion of cotton, and with all the above articles carries on a considerable trade with the other provinces. The Lake of Atitan occupies the greater part of the extent of this province. This lake is six or seven leagues in circumference, and on its shores are established the finest settlements ; and it has this singular property, that although it be entered by several very considerable rivers, it always keeps the same level ; the natural inference of which is, that it has some subterraneous vent. In the s. part of this lake the currents are violent, and the sounding is not to be found, nor is there any strand save that by Atitan and Polopo. The water is extremely cold, notwithstanding the temperature of the province is hot. No fish breed in this lake, a circumstance attributed to its coldness, though the Indians have an idea that it is owing to a visitation of providence on a certain alcalde mayor who had committed many excesses against the fisheries. 
The greater part of the traffic of the province is carried on by great canoes, inasmuch as the landrouts are extremely rocky and difficult, and the whole of the country is mountainous and full of ravines. Here are two volcanoes, the one of which is called Atitan, and the other Solola. Both at no great distance from the lake.  
Solola, the capital, is of the same name, with the dedicatory title of Nuestra Senora de la Asuncion. It has a convent of the religious of S.

The longest branch rises in Greenland, about three miles from Amariscoggin River, where is a pond called Songo Pond, two miles long. This stream, which pursues a s. course for at least 70 miles, is so free from rapids, that timber may be brought conveniently from within a few miles of its head. The other branch comes from Waterford and Suncook, and passes through a number of small ponds ; then falling into Long Pond, it proceeds through Brandy Pond, and meets the other branch.

==[[Sonora|SONORA]]==, S. Juan Baptista de, a province and government ; bounded n. by nations of Indians but little known, s. by the province of Sinaloa, e. by the province of Taraumara, and w. by the coast of the sea of Californias, following the coast its whole extent for more than 100 leagues, and being about 350 leagues in circumference, as to that part which has been reconnoitred and is settled. It was discovered in 1596 by Captain Sebastian, a Vizcayan, when he went to discover and reconnoitre the Californias. It takes its name from a valley it has, of more than 60 leagues long, and which the first Spaniards called La Sefiora, and in which governed a cacique, or regular chief, over the infinite Indians with whom these countries were peopled. The same Indians voluntarily solicited instruction in the Catholic faith in 1638 ; and on their having been committed to the charge of the Jesuits, the father Bartolome Castano went out on the mission and baptised many. His labours were imitated by several others ; and they succeeded in founding 25 settlements of the Indians, called the Pi mas Baxos, Opatas, Tobas, Tequiamas, Hequis, Pimas Altos, Ceris, Tepocas, and Guaimas ; all of whom, excepting the latter nation, dwell in the finest valleys. Such valleys, however, are very few, and are, properly speaking, ramifications of the mother sierra ; nor can they be approached without that sierra being first passed. 
This province is watered by many rivers and streams, which make it most abundantly irrigated, and very fertile for crops of maize, French beans, and wheat ; as also for vines yielding excellent grapes, although in no quantity, either from want of attention in the Indians or from their ignorance in the cultivation of them. The territory also yields many other fruits, as well of America as of Europe ; also pulse and gardenherbs. Ithas many silvermines, the working of which is not worth speaking of, owing to the great expense of labour. 
As a defence to the settlements of this province against the invasions of the Apaches Indians, there have been established, at different periods, five garrisons, furnished with a sufficient supply of troops, and of the names of Visani, San Felipe de Jesus Guevavi, Horcasitas, Coro de Guachi, Pitiqui, Rio Chico, and Buenavista. 
In 1744, the father Jacobo Sedelmair, a Jesuit, reconnoitred this province to find a pass by the 

VOL. IV.  m  n. to reduce the province of Moqui, [an independent nation of Indians since 1680J ; and in 1765, the inhabitants of Sonora, enraged at the hostilities they had experienced from the infidel Indians, sent to the viceroy, then the Marquis de Croix, and besought him that he would furnish them with troops and arms for their defence. — Although the royal coffers were at that time in a very low state, a sum was raised by means of the commerce of the province, and by the subscriptions of individuals, equal to 200,000 dollars, and an expedition was entrusted to the charge of Don Joseph de Galves, who was, at that time, in that kingdom. A six years' war was the event, before that, in 1771, he could reduce those barbarous tribes. 
In pursuing them, he traversed with his army over parts hitherto unattempted by Spaniards, and in some of the sierras through which he passed, discovered rich mines of gold and silver; and in the spot called La Cienequilla, which is a llanura of upwards of 14 leagues long, were found only two foot from the surface of the earth lumps of gold of such magnitude, as that one alone should weigh nine marks ; and thus were many thousands of marks of gold collected, without even the trouble of washing the earth from off it. Indeed, such were the riches of this mine, that some intelligent persons have asserted that it might have produced a million of dollars. This affair soon caused no less than 2000 persons immediately to settle here. The form of the government of the province was changed, and a commandantgeneral appointed, who was Don Theodore de Croix, knight of Croix, and of the Teutonic order, and now colonel and director of the regiment of the Royal Walloon Guards ; and, in honour of this expedition, the aforesaid Don Joseph de Galvez took the title of La Sonora ; though some years after, and on another occasion, he changed it for that of Castilla. 
[Humboldt thus describes that tract of country which he denominates the Intendancy of Sonora. This intendancy, which is still more thinly peopled than that of Durango, extends along the Gulf of California, called also the Sea of Cortez, for more than 280 leagues from the great bay of Bayona, or the Rio del Rosario, to the mouth of the Rio Colorado, formerly called Rio de Balzas, on the banks of which the missionary monks Pedro Nadral and Marcos de Niza made astronomical observations in the 16th century. The breadth of the intendancy is by no means uniform. From the tropic of Cancer to the 27th degree the breadth scarcely exceeds 50 leagues ;] 3 L  S O N O R A.  
[but further n. towards the Rio Gila, it increases so considerably, that on the parallel of Arispe it is more than 128 leagues. 
The intendancy of Sonora comprehends an extent of hilly country of greater surface than the half of France ; but its absolute population is not equal to the fourth of the most peopled department of that empire. The intendant who resides in the town of Arispe has the charge, as well as the intendant of San Luis Potosi, of the administration of several provinces, which have preserved the particular names which they had before the union. The intendancy of Sonora, consequently, comprehends the three provinces of Cinaloa or Sinaloa, Ostimury, and Sonora Proper. The first extends from the Rio del Rosario to the Rio del Fuerte ; the second from the Rio del Fuerte to the Rio del Mayo ; and the province of Sonora, called also in old maps by the name of New Navarre, includes all the northern extremity of this intendancy. The small district of Cinaloa is now looked on as part of the province of Cinaloa. The intendancy of Sonora is bounded on the w. by the sea ; on the s. by the intendancy of Guadalaxara ; and on the e. by a very uncultivated part of New Biscay. Its n. limits are very uncertain. The villages De la Pimeria alta are separated from the banks of the Rio Gila by a region inhabited by independent Indians, of which neither the soldiers stationed in the presidios, nor the monks posted in the neighbouring missions, have been hitherto able to make the conquest. 
From the port of Guitivis, at the mouth of the Rio Mayo, called also Santa Cruz de Mayo, the courier embarks for California, charged with the dispatches of the government and the public correspondence. This courier goes on horseback from Guatemala to the city of Mexico, and from thence by Guadalaxara and the Rosario to Guitivis. After crossing in a lancha the sea of Cortez, he disembarks at the village of Loreto in Old California. From this village letters are sent from mission to mission to Monterey and the port of San Francisco, situate in New California under lat. 37° 48' n. They thus traverse a route of posts of more than 920 leagues, that is to say, a distance equal to that from Lisbon to Cherson. The river of Yaqui, or Sonora, has a course of considerable length ; it takes its rise in the w. declivity of the Sierra Madre, of which the crest, by no means very elevated, passes between Arispe and the Presidio de Fronteras. The small port of Guaymas is situate near its mouth. The most n. part of the intendancy of Sonora  bears the name of Pimeria, on account of a numerous tribe of Pimas Indians who inhabit it. These Indians, for the most part, live under the domination of the missionary monks, and follow the catholic ritual. The Pimeria Alta is distinguished from the Pimeria Baxa ; the latter contains the Presidio de Buenavista ; the former extends from the military post (presidio) of Ternate to the Rio Gila. This hilly country of the Pimeria Alta is the Choco of N. America. All the ravins, and even plains, contain gold scattered up and clown the alluvious land. Pejntas of pure gold, of the weight of from two to three kilogrammes, (from 51b. to 81b. troy) have been found there. But these lavaderos are by no means diligently sought after, on account of the frequent incursions of the independent Indians, and especially on account of the high price of provisions, which must be brought from a great distance in this uncultivated country. Further n. on the right bank of the Rio de la Ascension, live a very warlike race of Indians, the Seris, to whom several Mexican savans attribute an Asiatic origin, on account of the analogy between their name and that of the Seri, placed by ancient geographers at the foot of the mountains of Ottorocoras to the e. of Scythia extra Imaum. 
There has been hitherto no permanent communication between Sonora, New Mexico, and New California, although the court of Madrid has frequently given orders for the formation of presidios and missions between the Rio Gila and the Rio Colorado.' The extravagant military expedition of Don Joseph Galvez did not serve to establish in a permanent manner the n. limits of the intendancy of Sonora. Two courageous and enterprising monks, fathers Garces and Font, were able, however, to go by land through the countries inhabited by independent Indians from the missions of La Pimeria Alta to Monterey, and even to the port of San Francisco, without crossing the peninsula of Old California. This bold enterprise, on which the college of the Propaganda at Queretaro published an interesting notice, has also furnished new information relative to the ruins of La Casa Grande, considered by the Mexican historians (Clavigero, i. p. 159) as the abode of the Aztecs on their arrival at the Rio Gila towards the end of the twelfth century. 
Father Francisco Garces, accompanied by Father Font, (see Chronica Serafica de el Colegio de Propaganda fede de Queretaro, por Fray Domingo Arricivitor, Mexico, 1792, torn. ii. p. 396, 426, and 462,) who was entrusted with the observations of latitude, set out from the Pre-]  

SONORA.  [sidio d'Horcasitas on the 20th April, 1773. After a journey of 1 1 days they arrived at a vast and beautiful plain, one league's distance from the s. bank of the Rio Gila. They there discovered the ruins of an ancient Aztec city, in the midst of which is the edifice called La Casa Grande. These ruins occupy a space of ground of more than a square league. The Casa Grande is exactly laid down according to the four cardinal points, having from n. to s. 136 metres (or 445 feet) in length, and from e. to w. 84 metres (or 276 feet) in breadth. It is constructed of clay (tapia) . The pises, or cases in which the clay is rammed down in the construction of a clay wall, are of an unequal size, but symmetrically placed. The walls are 12 decimeters (or three feet 11 inches) in thickness. This edifice had three stories and a terrace. The stair was on the outside, and probably of wood. The same kind of construction is still to be found in all the villages of the independent Indians of the Moqui w. from New Mexico. In the Casa Grande were five apartments, of which each is 27.18 feet in length, 10.82 feet in breadth, and 11.48 feet in height. A wall, interrupted by large towers, surrounds the principal edifice, and appears to have served to defend it. Father Garces discovered the vestiges of an artificial canal, which brought the water of the Rio Gila to the town. The whole surrounding plain is covered with broken earthen pitchers and pots, prettily painted in white, red, and blue. We also find amidst these fragments of Mexican stoneware pieces of obsidian (itztli), a very curious phenomenon, because it proves that the Aztecs passed through some unknown n. country which contains this volcanic substance, and that it was not the abundance of obsidian in New Spain which suggested the idea of razors and arms of Itztli. We must not, however, confound the ruins of this city of the Gila, the centre of an ancient civilization of the Americans, with the Casas Grandes of New Biscay, situate between the presidio of Yanos and that of San Buenaventura. The latter are pointed out by the indigenous, on the very vague supposition that the Aztic nation, in their migration from Aztlan to Tula and the valley of Tenochtitlan, made three stations ; the first near the lake Teguyo (to the s. of the fabulous city of Quivira, the Mexican Dorado !) the second at the Rio Gila, and the third in the environs of Yanos. 
The Indians who live in the plains adjoining the Casas Grandes of the Rio Gila, and who have never had the smallest communication with the inhabitants of Sonora, deserve by no means the  appellation of Indios bravos. Their social civilization forms a singular contrast with the state of the savages who wander along the banks of the Missoury, and other parts of Canada. Fathers Garces and Font found the Indians to the s. of the Rio Gila clothed and assembled together, to the number of two or three thousand, in villages which they call Uturicut and Sutaquisan, where they peaceably cultivate the soil. They saw fields sown with maize, cotton, and gourds. The missionaries, in order to bring about the conversion of these Indians, showed them a picture painted on a large piece of cotton cloth, in which a sinner Was represented burning in the flames of hell. The picture terrified them, and they entreated Father Garces not to unrol it any more, nor speak to them of what would happen after death. These Indians are of a gentle and sincere character. Father Font explained to them by an interpreter the security which prevailed in the Christian missions, where an Indian alcalde administered justice. The chief of Uturicut replied : " This order of things may be necessary for you. We do not steal, and we very seldom disagree ; what use have we then for an alcalde among us ?" The civilization to be found among the Indians when we approach the n. w. coast of America, from the 33° to the 54° of latitude, is a very striking phenomenon, which cannot but throw some light on the history of the first migrations of the Mexican nations. 
There are reckoned in the province of Sonora one city, Arispe ; two towns, viz. Sonora and Hostemuri ; 46 villages, or settlements, 15 parishes, 43 missions, 20 farms, or haciendas, and 25 cottages, or ranchos. 
The province of Cinaloa contains five towns (Culiacan, Cinaloa, El Rosario, El Fuerte, and Los Alamos), 92 villages, 30 parishes, 14 haciendas, and 450 ranchos. 
In 1793 the number of tributary Indians in the province of Sonora amounted only to 251, while in the province of Cinaloa they amounted to 1851. This last province was more ancientlypeopled than the former. 
The most remarkable places of the intendancy of Sonora are : Arispe, Sonora, Hostimuri, Culiacan, Cinaloa, El Rosario, Villa del Fuerte, Los Alamos. ^ 
The population of this intendancy amounted, in 1803, to 121,400 : the extent of surface, in square leagues, is 19,143; making the number of inhabitants to the square league 6.]

==[[Sonsonate|SONSONATE]]==, [or Trinidad,] a province and alcaldia mayor of the kingdom of Guatemala in N. America : bounded s. by the S. Sea ; n. by the sierra; e. and the other rhumbs by the province and alcaldia mayor of San Salvador, which surrounds it; and w. by that of Escuintla or Guazacapan. Its extent is 25 leagues long, and 15 wide at the broadest part. It is of a very hot climate, produces some cacao, which, in former times, was in greater abundance, through the large estates which it had of this production, but which have been, for the most part, abandoned; the natives having rather addicted themselves to the cultivation of indigo, which they procure from a plant called  there guiquilite, this being the chief article of commerce. It produces also much sugar, which they make in the engines ; rice and starch, made ofyuca root, in such abundance, as by these two last articles to supply the whole kingdom of Guatemala; also in ajonjoli, (sessamum) from which they extract a certain portion of oil. Its territory produces no wheat, owing to the heat of the climate; and what is necessary is therefore provided from the alcaldias may ores of Xalapa and Totonicapan. It has large breeds of swine, which it sends in droves to the capital ; of neat cattle ; domestic fowl, fruit, and vegetables, necessary for its own consumption, and of very superior quality. In this province are many muleteers, who, in rcqieas, or droves of 25 to 50 mules, which they call atajos, cany on the traffic of conveying the aforesaid effects to the port of its name, and to the capital. It is watered by various rivers, which run to empty themselves into the S. Sea; with the exception of that which they call Del Agua Caliente (of warm water), which is very large, and enters the N. Sea. 
In its jurisdiction is comprehended the celebrated coast of Balsamo, whereon is found the richest balsam known, and consequently highly esteemed in all parts. The population, which amounts to about 40,000 souls, is entirely of Indians, Mulattoes, Negroes, and other casts ; although there are not wanting some Spanish families. Along the whole coast of the S. Sea the waters are so violent, as to deserve any name rather than that of Pacific ; and as the only commercial port here, called Acajutla, is nothing more than a very large bay, in which vessels lie exposed to the inclemency of the weather, and at a distance from land ; it follows that the lading and unlading of merchandise are attended with great inconveniences, and not unfrequently with considerable loss. Notwithstanding this, however, vessels do not fail to arrive here from the kingdoms of Nueva Espaiia, Tierra Firme, and Peru : from the convenience of this spot being only four leagues distant from the capital, and of throwing the effects immediatelj into the interior provinces. 
The capital is of the same name, with the dedicatory title of Santissima Trinidad ; being a town founded on the shore of the river of its name, and four miles from the port of Acajutla; which has also the same title, in the S. Sea, and is a large bay, much frequented by vessels from the kingdoms of Peru, Tierra Firme ; and Nueva Espana, conveying the greatest part of the traffic carried on with Guatemala.  It has, besides the parish church, three convents of religious ; which are of San Francisco, S.Domingo, and La Merced; a convent for female orphans, founded by Don Fr. Juan de Zapata and Sandoval, of the order of San Agustin, bishop of Vera Paz. Its population, which is tolerably large, is composed of three wards ; bearing the names of Sonsonate, Mexicanos, and San Antonio; and in these dwell about 100 Indians and 1900 other souls, of which 400 may be Spaniards. 
This town, although of the greatest impor-  tance from the reasons above mentioned, has no tains 100 housekeepers  productions corresponding to its climate. It contains more than 200 housekeepers and 100 Indians ; and is six leagues n. of Santa Fe.

In its vicinity runs the grand Sierra Apaneca for many leagues from e. to w. and in it are three volcanoes. Its temperature is hot. As the port aforesaid is close to the capital of the kingdom Guatemala, there are in the vicinities of this town many muleteers, masters of large droves, who employ themselves in carrying merchandise ; and as this is the principal branch of commerce, the number who thus gain their livelihood is very great.

[==[[Sorel|SOREL]]==, a small town; situate at the entrance of the river Sorel, which runs into Lake Champlain. It has a respectable appearance from the water : it is somewhat smaller than Three Rivers, and is inhabited by several English and Frenchfamilies. The streets are prettily laid out, but the houses are yet very thinly scattered. Sorel, indeed, seems rather on the decline, both in wealth and population ; and the few stores that are kept there, are mostly dependent upon the merchants of Montreal and Quebec. Its trade is confined to the supplying the inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood with  West India  
Mas for  
44(j    merry attached to Sorel, arose from the shipbuilding carried on there for some years ; but of late that has entirely ceased. 
The country people in the vicinity are mostly employed as voyageurs in the n. w. fur trade, and the cultivation of their small farms is left to their wives and children. When they return home, they seldom bring more than enough to support them during the winter. The soil is thus neglected, and the town is badly supplied with provisions. Three horrid murders were committed here about nine or ten years ago. A store, kept by an old man, was observed, one morning, not opened as usual : the neighbours knocked at the door, but not getting admittance, they broke it open, and discovered the old man, and his niece who lived with him, lying dead behind the counter. It appeared that they must have been just called from supper to serve the villain who had murdered them, for the supper things were laid out on the table in an adjoining parlour. The till was emptied of all the money, and many articles strewed about the floor. 
The very next night, to the dread and astonishment of this little town, another man wasmurdered in his store in a similar manner, and his money stolen; but what was most surprising, the murderer remained undiscovered, and even unsuspected ! nor was it ever positively ascertained who had been guilty of such atrocious deeds. But when the foreman of the shipyard, an European, decamped a few days after, with the wife of a tradesman in the town, strong suspicions were entertained that he was the murderer. He however made his escape into the United States, before any measures could be taken to apprehend him.] 
Sorel, a fort built by the French in the province and country of the Iroquees Indians ; situate at the w. point of the mouth of the river of the same name. 
[Sorel, River, the outlet of Lake Champlain, which, after a course of about 69 miles n. empties into the river St. Lawrence, in lat. 46° 5', and long. 72° 55' w. 
The country in the neighbourhood of the river Sorel does not yield to the others either in fertility or beauty. This river has three names ; sometimes it is called Sorel, sometimes Chambly, (places thus named being situate upon it) and sometimes Richlieu. This river is of great value to Canada, because it has its source in Lake Champlain, from whence great quantities of valuable produce, particularly shiptimber and pot-   ashes, are annually introduced from the United States. Indeed, it is the only channel acknowledged in law for the commerce of the States with Lower Canada. Hence, at a place called St. John's, on this river, near the lake, we have established a customhouse, which takes cognizance of whatever passes to and from the United States. 
There is a fort at Chambly, and another at St. John's ; neither of them are very formidable: that at Chambly is built of stone ; that at St. John's of wood. We generally have some troops at St. John's, as it is a frontier town.]

[SOUFFRIER Mountain. The most northerly of the lofty chain running through the centre of the island St. Vincent, and the highest of the whole, as computed by the most accurate survey that has as yet been taken. For some time previous to the 30th April, 1812, this memorable mountain had indicated much disquietude ; and, from the extraordinary frequency and violence of earthquakes, (which are calculated to have exceeded 200 within the preceding year) had portended some great movement or eruption. The apprehension, however, was not so immediate as to restrain curiosity, or to prevent repeated visits to the crater, which of late had been more numerous than at any former period, even up to Sunday last, the 26th of April ; when some gentlemen ascended it, and remained there for some time. Nothing unusual was then remarked, or  any external difference observed, except rather a stronger emission of smoke from the interstices of the conical hill, at the bottom of the crater. To those who have not visited this romantic and wonderful spot, a slight description of it, as it lately stood, is previously necessary and indispensable, to form any conception of it, and to the better understanding the account which follows ; for no one living can expect to see it again in the perfection and beauty in which it was on Sunday, the 26th instant. 
About 2000 feet from the level of the sea, (calculating from conjecture) on the s. side of the mountain, and rather more than twothirds of its height, opens a circular chasm, somewhat exceeding half a mile in diameter, and between four or 500 feet in depth : exactly in the centre of this capacious bowl rose a conical hill, about 260 or 300 feet in height, and about 200 in diameter, richly covered and variegated with shrubs, brushwood, and vines, above halfway up, and for the remainder powdered over with virgin sulphur to the top. From the fissures in the cone and interstices of the rock a thin white smoke was constantly emitted, occasionally tinged with a slight bluish flame. The precipitous sides of this magnificent amphitheatre were fringed with various evergreens and aromatic shrubs, flowers, and many Alpine plants. On the n. and s. sides of the base of the cone were two pieces of water, one perfectly pure and tasteless, the other strongly impregnated with sulphur and alum. This lonely and beautiful spot was rendered more enchanting by the singularly melodious notes of a bird, an inhabitant of these upper solitudes, and altogether unknown to the other parts of the island : hence principally callthough it cer-  ed, or supposed to be, invisible;  tainly has been seen, and is a species of the merle. 
A century had now elapsed since the last convulsion of the mountain, or since any other elements had disturbed the serenity of this wilderness than those which are common to the tropical tempest. It apparently slumbered in primeval solitude and tranquillity, and from the luxuriant  vegetation  and  growth of the forest which co-  vered its sides from the base nearly to the summit, seemed to discountenance the fact, and falsify the records of the ancient volcano. Such was the majestic, peaceful Souffrier, on April the 27th ; but the surrounding inhabitants trod on " ignem repositum cineri doloso," and their imaginary safety was soon to be confounded by the sudden danger of devastation. Just as the]

[plantation bells rang twelve at noon, on Monday the 27th, an abrupt and dreadful crash from the mountain, with a severe concussion of the earth, and tremulous noise in the air, alarmed all around it. The resurrection of this fiery furnace was proclaimed in a moment by a vast column of thick, black, ropy smoke, like that of an immense giasshouse, burstingforth at once, and mounting to the sky ; showering down sand, with gritty calcined particles of earth and favilla mixed, on all below. This driven before the wind towards Wallibon and Morne Ronde, darkened the air like a cataract of rain, and covered the ridges, woods, and canepieces, with light grey coloured ashes, resembling snow when slightly covered by dust. As the eruption increased, this continual" shower expanded, destroying every appearance of vegetation. At night a very considerable degree of ignition was observed on the lips of the crater : but it is not asserted, that there was as yet any visible ascension of flame. The same awful scene presented itself on Tuesday ; the fall of favilla and calcined pebbles still increasing, and the compact pitchy column from the crater, rising perpendicularly to an immense height, with a noise, at intervals, like the muttering of distant thunder. On Wednesday the 29th, all these menacing symptoms of horror and combustion still gathered more thick and terrific for miles around the dismal and halfobscured mountain. The prodigious column shot up with quicker motion, dilating as it rose like a balloon. The sun appeared in total eclipse, and shed a meridian twilight over us, that aggravated the wintry gloom of the scene, now completely powdered over with falling particles. It was evident that the crisis was as yet to come — that the burning fluid was struggling for a vent, and labouring to throw off the superincumbent strata and obstructions, which suppressed the ignivomous torrent. At night, it was manifest, that it had greatly disengaged itself from its burden, by the appearance of fire flashing now and then, flaking above the mouth of the crater. 
On Thursday, the memorable 30th of April, the reflection of the rising sun on this majestic body of curling vapour was sublime beyond imagination — any comparison of the Glaciers, of the Andes, or Cordilleras with it, can but feebly convey an idea of the fleecy whiteness and brilliancy of this awful column of intermingled and wreathed smoke and clouds: it afterwards assumed a more sulphureous cast, like what we call thunderclouds, and in the course of the day a ferruginous and sanguine appearance, with  much livelier action in the ascent, a more extensive dilation, as if almost freed from every obstruction — after noon, the noise was incessant, and resembled the approach of thunder still nearer and nearer, with a vibration, that affected the feelings and hearing : as yet there was no convulsive motion, or sensible earthquake. Terror and consternation now seized all beholders. The Caribes settled at Morne Ronde, at the foot of the Souffrier, abandoned their houses, with their live stock, and every thing they possessed, and fled precipitately towards town. The Negroes became confused, forsook their work, looked up to the mountain, and, as it shook, trembled, with the dread of what they could neither understand or describe — the birds fell to the ground, overpowered with showers of favilla, unable to keep themselves on the wing ; the cattle were starving for want of food; as not a blade of grass or a leaf was now to be found ; the sea was much discoloux'ed, but in no wise uncommonly agitated : and it is remarkable, that throughout the whole of this violent disturbance of the earth, it continued quite passive, and did not at any time sympathise with the agitation of the land. About four o'clock j?. m. the noise became more alarming, and just before sunset the clouds reflected a bright copper colour, suffused with fire. Scarcely had the day closed, when the flame burst at length pyramidically from the crater, through the mass of smoke ; the rolling of the thunder became more awful and deafening : electric flashes quickly succeeded, attended with loud claps ; and now, indeed, the hurlyburly began. Those only who have witnessed such a sight, can form any idea of the magnificence and variety of the lightning and electric flashes ; some forked zigzag playing across the perpendicular column from the crater — others shooting upwards from the mouth like rockets of the most dazzling lustre — others, like shells with their trailing fuses, flying in different parabolas, with the most vivid scintillations from the dark sanguine column, which now seemed inflexible, and immovable by the wind. Shortly after seven p. m. the mighty caldron was seen to simmer, and the ebullition of lava to break out on the n. w. side. This, immediately after boiling over the orifice, and flowing a short way, was opposed by the acclivity of a higher point of land, over which it was impelled by the immense tide of liquified fire that drove it on, forming the figure V in grand illumination. Sometimes, when the ebullition slackened, or was insufficient to urge it over the obstructing hill, it recoiled]  

SOUFFKIER MOUNTAIN.  [back, like a refluent billow from the rock, and then again rushed forward, impelled by fresh supplies, and scaling every obstacle, carrying rocks and woods together, in its course down the slope of the mountain, until it precipitated itself down some vast ravine, concealed from our sight by the intervening ridges of Morne Ronde. Vast globular bodies of fire were seen projected from the fiery furnace, and bursting, fell back into it, or over it, on the surrounding bushes, which were instantly set in flames. About four hours from the lava boiling over the crater, it reached the sea, as we could observe from the reflection of the fire and the electric flashes attending it. About half past one, another stream of lava was seen descending to the e. towards Rabacca. The thundering noise of the mountain, and the vibration of sound, that had been so formidable hitherto, now mingled in the sullen monotonous roar of the rolling lava, became so terrible, that dismay was almost turned into despair. At this time the first earthquake was felt : this was followed by showers of cinders, that fell with the hissing noise of hail during two hours. At three o'clock, a rolling on the roofs of the houses indicated a fall of stones, which soon thickened, and at length descended in a rain of intermingled fire, that threatened at once the fate of Pompeii or Herculaneum. The crackling and coruscations from the crater at this period exceeded all that had yet passed. The eyes were struck with momentary blindness, and the ears stunned with the glomeration of sounds. People sought shelter in cellars, under rocks, or any where, for every where was nearly the same ; and the miserable Negroes, flying from their huts, were knocked down or wounded ; and many killed in the open air. Several houses were set on fire. The estates situate in the immediate vicinity seemed doomed to destruction. Had the stones that fell been proportionably heavy to their sjze, not a living creature could have escaped without death : these having undergone a thorough fusion, they were divested of their natural gravity, and fell almost as light as pumex, though in some places as large as a man's head. This dreadful rain of stones and fire lasted upwards of an hour, and was again succeeded by cinders from three till six o'clock in the morning. Earthquake followed earthquake almost momentarily, or rather the whole of this part of the island was in a state of continued oscillation; — not agitated by shocks, vertical or horizontal ; but undulated, like water shaken in a bowl. 

VOL. IV.  
The break of day, if such it could be called, was truly terrific. Darkness was only visible at eight o'clock, and the birth of May dawned like the day of judgment : a chaotic gloom enveloped the mountain, and an impenetrable haze hung over the sea, with black sluggish clouds of a sulphureous cast. The whole island was covered with favilla, cinders, scoria, and broken masses of volcanic matter. It was not until the afternoon the muttering noise of the mountain sunk gradually into a solemn yet suspicious silence. Such were the particulars of this sublime and tremendous scene, from commencement to catastrophe. We shall now describe its effects, or the injury it has done. 
The following authentic information, on this head, is derived from extracts of a letter from the Speaker of the Assembly of St. Vincent, to the Colonial Agent in London, dated St. Vincent, May 6, 1812. 
' On one estate, called Wallibou, to leeward, and on five more to windward, or, as we speak here, in the Caribe country, the earth is still covered with what I will still term ashes, from six to 12 inches ; and on one estate the walls of the boilinghouse fell in, as it is supposed, from the effects of an earthquake. 
' Excepting the one estate to leeward, and those five to windward, I do not believe the injury has been very great. The ashes have fallen abundantly on two or three others, but, it is hoped, not enough materially to injure the soil ; this, however, as well as the effect where it is deeper, must be ascertained by experience. We have no data to judge whether it be a mere caput mortitum, or if it contain the sources of vegetation ; if the latter, labour and industry may bring matters about ; but if the former, I do not know what to say. So the rivers which turn the mills on these estates may resume their courses ; but no human wisdom can do more than conjecture on the subject. 
' The estates, from the Caribe boundary, and from Wallibou, have not, as I understood, received any injury ; the ashes fell indeed to the extent of many miles at sea, for, after the great and heavy part was deposited, the lighter par^ tides seem to have been dispersed in all directions throughout the island ; it has made a light thin crust, about onefourth or oneeighth of an inch thick, which we consider as doing more good than harm. 
' Only one white man, and I believe 40 or 50 Negroes, have been lost; and some magasshouses, Negro houses, and other buildings tookj 3 m  SOU  s o u  
[fire, from the ignited stones, which were discharged to a considerable distance, and at certain periods in great profusion. 
' This, I believe, is a tolerably correct statement of the effects produced by this dreadful event ; though I speak with some hesitation as to the damage suffered by two estates in the Caribe country, and one to leeward, called Richmond, the accounts which I have not agreeing very well. My opinion is, that the damage is not great, but persons concerned in all the properties from Mount Young (to windward), and from Wallibou (to leeward), may be at ease as to any loss.']

It lies between lat. 32° 35' 15" n. and between long. 78° 80' 84" w. from Greenwich. It is in length about 200 miles from n. to s. and 260 from e. to w. and contains 20,000 square miles. It is divided into nine districts. Charleston, Beaufort, and Georgetown, constitute what is called the Lower Country, and con= tained, by the census of 1792, 19 parishes, and 28,694 white inhabitants ; sent to the legislature 70 representatives, and 20 senators, and paid taxes to the amount of £2808 15*. lid. Ninety- Six, Washington, Pinckney, Camden, Orangeburg, and Cheraw districts, are comprehended in the Upper Country, and contained 23 counties, and 110,902 white inhabitants; sent to the legislature 54 representati ves, and 17 senators, and paid taxes to the amount of £8390 2s. 3d. The great inequality of representation is obvious ; attempts have been made by the upper districts to remedy this evil, but hitherto without effect. By a late arrangement, the name of county is given to the subdivision of those districts only, in which county courts are established. In the lower districts, the subdivisions are called parishes, and made only for the purpose of electing the members of the state legislature. The total number of inhabitants, in 1790, was 249,073, of whom 107,094 were slaves ; by the census of 1810, the total population amounted to 414,935 souls. This state is watered by many navigable rivers, the principal of which are, Savannah, Edisto, Santee, Pedee, and their branches. The Santee is the largest river in the state. Those of a secondary size, as you pass from n. to s. are Wakkamaw, Black, Cooper, Ashepoo, and Combahee rivers. In the third class are comprehended those rivers which extend but a short distance from the ocean, and serve, by branching into numberless creeks, as drains to carry off the rain water which comes down from the large inland swamps, or are merely arms of tire sea. The tide in no part of the state flows above 25 miles from the sea. A canal has been lately made, of 21 miles in length, connecting Cooper and Santee rivers, the cost of which was upwards of 400,000 dollars ; and the company are allowed to raise a toll of 20 per cent, on the sum actually expended. A waggon road has also been opened]

The only harbours of note, are those of Charleston, Port Royal, and Georgetown. The climate is different in diffent parts of the state. Along the seacoast, bilious diseases, and fevers of various kinds, are prevalent between July and October. 
The probability of dying is much greater between the 20th of June and the 20th of October, than in the other eight months in the year. One cause of these diseases is, a low marshy country, which is overflowed for the sake of cultivating rice. The exhalations from these stagnated waters, from the rivers, and from the neighbouring ocean, and the profuse perspiration of vegetables of all kinds, which cover the ground, fill the air with moisture. This moisture falls in frequent rains and copious dews. From actual observation, it has been found that the average annual fall of rain, for 10 years, was 42 inches, without regarding the moisture that fell in fogs and dews. The great heat of the day relaxes the body, and the agreeable coolness of the evening invites to an exposure to these heavy dews. But not only does the water on the low grounds and rice swamps become in a degree putrid, and emit an unwholesome vapour, but when it is dried up or drawn off from the surface of the ground, a quantity of weeds and grass, which have been rotted by the water, and animals and fish which have been destroyed by it, are exposed to the intense heat of the sun, and help to infect the air with a quantity of poisonous effluvia. Within the limits of Charleston the case is very different, and the danger of contracting diseases arises from indolence and excess. Though a residence in or near the swamps is very injurious to health, yet it has been satisfactorily ascertained, that by removing three miles from them, into the pine land, which occupies the middle ground between the rivers, an exemption from autumnal fevers may be obtained. The disagreeable effects of this climate, experience has proved, might in a great measure be avoided, by those inhabitants whose circumstances will admit of their removal from the neighbourhood of the rice swamps, to healthier situations, during the months of July, August, September, and October; and in the worst situations by temperance and care. Violent exercise on horseback, chiefly, exposure to the meridian rays of the sun, sudden showers of rain, and the night air, are too frequently the causes of fevers and other disorders.  
Would the sportsmen deny themselves, during the fall months, their favourite amusements of hunting and fishing, or confine themselves to a very few hours, in the morning or evening — would the industrious planter visit his fields only at the same hours — or would the poorer class of people pay due attention to their manner of living, and observe the precautions recommended to them by men of knowledge and experience, much sickness, and many distressing events, might be prevented. 
But the following authentic table of the obituary of Charleston, will best explain the nature of the diseases most prevalent in this climate.

21 1 5 12 16 10 2  The Upper Country, situate in the medium between extreme heat and cold, is as healthful as any part of the United States. Except the high hills of Santee, the Ridge, and some few other hills, this country is like one extensive plain, till /ou reach the Tryon and Hogback Mountains, 220 miles n. w. of Charleston. The elevation of these mountains above their base, is 3840 feet, and above the seacoast, 4640. There is exhibited from the top of these mountains an extensive view of this state, N. Carolina, and Georgia; and, as no object intervenes to obstruct the view, a man with telescopic eyes might discern vessels at sea. The mountains w. and n. w. rise much higher than these, and form a ridge, which divides the waters of Tennessee and Santee Rivers. 
The seacoast is bordered with a chain of fine sea islands, around which the sea flows, opening an excellent inland navigation, for the conveyance of produce to market. North of Charle-  ston harbour lie Bull's, Dewee's, and Sullivan's islands, which form the n. part of the harbour. James's Island lies on the other side of the harbour, opposite Charleston, containing about 50 families. Further s. w. is John's Island, larger than James's ; Stono River, which forms a convenient and safe harbour, divides these islands. Contiguous to John's Island, and connected with it by a bridge, is Wadmelaw ; e. of which are the small isles of Keywaw and Simmon. Between these and Edisto Island, is N. Edisto Inlet, which also affords a good harbour for vessels of easy draft of water. South of Edisto Island is S. Edisto Inlet, through which enter, from the n. all the vessels bound to Beaufort, Asheepoo, Combahee, and Coosaw. On the s. w. side of St. Helena Island lies a cluster of islands, one of the largest of which is Port Royal. Adjacent to Port Royal lie St. Helena, Ladies Island, Paris Island, and the Hunting Islands, five or six in number, bordering on the ocean, so called from the number of deer and other wild game found upon them. All these islands, and some others of less note, belong to St. Helena parish. 
Crossing Broad River, you come to Hilton Head, the most southern sea island in Carolina. West and s. zo. of Hilton Head lie Pinckney's, Bull's, Dawfuskies', and some smaller islands, between which and Hilton Head are Calibogie River and Sound, which form the outlet of May and New Rivers. The soil on these islands is generally better adapted to the culture of indigo and cotton than the main, and less suited to rice. The natural growth is the live oak, which is so excellent for ship timber ; and the palmetto or cabbage tree, the utility of which, in the construction of forts, was experienced during the late war. 
The whole state, to the distance of 80 or 100 miles from the sea, generally speaking, is low and level, almost without a stone, and abounds, more or less, especially on and near the rivers, with swamps or marshes, which, when cleared and cultivated, yield, in favourable seasons, on an average, an annual income of from 20 to 40 dollars for each acre, and often much more ; but this species of soil cannot be cultivated by white men, without endangering both health and life. These swamps do not cover an hundredth part of the State of Carolina. In this distance, by a gradual ascent from the seacoast, the land rises about 190 feet. Here, if you proceed in a w. n. w. course from Charleston, commences a curiously uneven country. The traveller is constantly ascending or descending little sandhills, which]

If a pretty high sea were suddenly arrested, and transformed into sandhills, in the very form the waves existed at the moment of transformation, it would present the eye with just such a view as is here to be seen. Some little herbage, and a few small pines, grow even on this soil. The inhabitants are few, and have but a scanty subsistence on corn and sweet potatoes, which grow here tolerably well. This curious country continues till you arrive at a place called the Ridge, 140 miles from Charleston. This ridge is a remarkable tract of high ground, as you approach it from the sea, but level as you advance n. w. from its summit. It is a fine high, healthy, belt of land, well watered, and of a good soil, and extends from the Savannah to Broad River. Beyond this ridge commences a country exactly resembling the northern states, or like Devonshire in England, or Languedoc in France. Here hills and dales, with all their verdure and variegated beauty, present themselves to the eye. Wheat fields, which are rare in the low country, begin to grow common. Here heaven has bestowed its blessings with a most bounteous hand. The air is much more temperate i nd healthful than nearer the sea. The hills are covered with valuable woods, the valleys watered with beautiful rivers, and the fertility of the soil is equal to every vegetable production. This, by way of distinction, is called the Upper Country, where are different modes, and different articles of cultivation ; where the manners of the people, and even their language, have a different tone. The land still rises by a gradual ascent ; each succeeding hill overlooks that which immediately precedes it, till having advanced 220 miles in a n. w. direction from Charleston, the elevation of the land above the seacoast is found by mensuration to be 800 feet. 
Here commences a mountainous country, which continues rising to the w. terminating point of the state. The soil may be divided into four kinds ; first, the pine barren, which is valuable only for its timber. Interspersed among the pine barren, are tracts of land free of timber and every kind of growth but that of grass. — These tracts are called savannas, constituting a second kind of soil, good for grazing. The third kind is that of the swamps and low grounds on the rivers, which is a mixture of black loam and fat clay, producing natural canes in great plenty, cypress, bays, loblolly pines, &c. In these swamps rice is cultivated, which constitutes the staple commodity of the state. The high lands,  commonly known by the name of oak and hickory lands, constitute the fourth kind of soil. The natural growth is oak, hickory, walnut, pine, and locust. On these lands, in the low country, are cultivated Indian corn principally; and in the back country, besides these, they raise tobacco in large quantities, wheat, rye, barley, oats, hemp, flax, and cotton. From experiments which have been made, it is well ascertained that olives, silk, and madder may be as abundantly produced in S. Carolina, and we may add in Georgia also, as in the s. of France. 
There is little fruit in this state, especially in the lower parts of it. They have oranges, which are chiefly sour, and figs in plenty, a few limes and lemons, pomegranates, pears, and peaches; apples are scarce, and are imported from the N. States. Melons, especially the watermelon, are raised here in great perfection. The river swamps, in which rice can be cultivated with any tolerable degree of safety and success, do not extend higher up the rivers than the head of the tides ; ariiri estimating the value of this species of rLe land, the height which the tide rises is taV^n into consideration, those lying where it rkes to a proper pitch for overflowing the swamps being the most valuable. The best inland swamps, which constitute a second species of rice land, are such as are furnished with reserves of water. These reserves are formed by means of large banks thrown up at the upper parts of the swamps, whence it is conveyed, when needed, to the fields of rice. ' Rice was first planted in S. Carolina, about the year 1688, when, by chance, a little of it, of a small unprofitable kind, was introduced into the state. In the year 1696, a bag of a larger and whiter rice, was presented by the captain of a brigantine from Madagascar, to the governi who divided it between several gentlemen. Some time afterwards Mr. Du Bois, treasurer to the British East India Company, sent another parcel of rice; which probably made the distinction which now prevails, between white and gold rice. In its early cultivation, rice was planted on high land ; but it being observed, that this plant not only required the richest kind of land, but also frequent flowings of water, the planters were naturally led from the high lands to the fresh water swamps. To these situations it was found perfectly adapted, and rice immediately became the great staple of the country. It was now that importations were made with great avidity ; and the proceeds of a crop instead of being spent in dissipated living, as they are at this day, were]  
^    SOUTH CAROLINA.   [economised, to increase the exertions of the ensuing j ear. Hence property was rapidly accumulated, and people from all parts were encouraged to try their fortunes in S. Carolina. 
Indigo was formerly a great source of wealth to this state, being introduced into it about the year 1745 ; and such was the success with which it was cultivated, that in less than two years 200,000 lbs. weight of indigo were exported to England. From that time its culture was much attended to throughout the lower, and in some situations, in the middle parts of the state; and many fortunes were made by pursuing this branch of agriculture. Since the commencement of the wars which have disturbed Europe for several years past, and in consequence of large importations from the E. Indies, its cultivation has ceased to be profitable, so that a very small quantity is now planted in S. Carolina. The lands which were suitable to the growth of this plant, are fortunately well adapted to the cultivation of cotton : hence, by an easy transition, and without much expense, the indigo planters, driven by necessity to search out other sources of industry, have directed their attention to the planting of cotton ; and the success they have experienced ought to stimulate the British government to accomplish the same thing with regard to hemp in Canada, where every thing is congenial to its success, were only a right system adopted. 
Cotton is noticed as an article of export in S. Carolina as early as the year 1754 ; but it is only within the last 20 years that it has become a staple commodity, and surpassed, in value, the greatest crops of rice or indigo that have ever been made in the state. The planter sells his cotton to the merchant at least for Is. and generally for ls.6d. sterling the pound. In the year 1799, good cotton found an immediate sale in Charleston for 2s. 4c?. and 2s. Sd. the pound ; and it is said, that what is called the island or seashore cotton, is at least equal, in fineness and strength of staple, to that of Jamaica. Since the embargo, the best cotton sold for 10c?. and the inferior from 4c?. to 6d. the pound ; and frequently no sale was to be found for it at any price. 
In S. Carolina, tobacco is cultivated under some disadvantages ; among which the expense and trouble of bringing it to market, is not the least to be encountered. It is grown principally in the upper country, remote from markets and navigation, where, although the land is well suited to its culture, yet no plantations of large extent have yet been established. Each farmer  plants a small field; which, though separately considered, cannot produce any considerable quantity, yet when collected for exportation, it forms a mass by no means unworthy the attention of the merchant. 
Maize, or Indian corn, is much cultivated in S. Carolina, both for home consumption and exportation. Like tobacco it is indigenous to America, or was obtained by the Indians from some other parts, long before the discovery of the continent. It consists of several varieties, of which the gourd and flint kind are principally planted. The difference between these kinds of corn is, that the gourd is floury, and wastes much in the grinding ; whereas the flint is more hard and nourishing, and grinds more into grist. Another peculiarity, which marks their difference, is, that the flint corn grows principally in the lower country, degenerating in the middle and upper country into gourd corn ; and the gourd corn, if brought from the middle and upper country, is said to change into a more flinty kind. 
Hemp is grown in the upper countryfor sale, particularly between Broad and Saluda Rivers, on what is called the Dutch Fork. Flax is also grown, but only for domestic use ; as are generally all kinds of small European grain. Wheat, however, in parts adjacent to good flour mills, is an exception to this ; for wherever mills are situated, a great encouragement is given to the growth of this valuable grain. The produce of wheat, in the upper country, where almost every one cultivates a little for domestic use, is generally about 15 bushels to the acre; but where the ground is well tilled, and the wheat ploughed in, (as is done by a few of the best farmers) the produce is from 20 to 25 bushels the acre. A slovenly practice too much prevails, of sowing the wheat over the Indian corn fields after the corn is gathered in, without having giving it any preparation whatever, except perhaps ploughing the seed (after it is sown) into the land; yet even in this careless manner the produce is frequently 12 bushels the acre. The reason which the farmers give for not setting those wheat crops in a better manner is, that, in this way they make with ease, and with little attendance, as much wheat as their household concerns require ; that to make more would be unnecessary, as they cannot conveniently transport so bulky an article any distance for sale. Canals and roads are, however, now constructing throughout the state, and will, in a few years, afford the back settlers every facility to dispose of their produce. Silk was formerly raised in S. Carolina and Georgia;]  

SOUTH CAROLINA.  [but it is now unattended to, though it appears that mulberry trees and silk worms are the spontaneous productions of the country. 
The implements of husbandry used in S. Carolina, are few and simple : they consist of various ploughs, such as the barshare, shovel, fluke, single coulter, cutter, and drill ; harrows, hoes, spades, waggons, carts, and sledges. Ploughs are chiefly used in the middle and upper country, where labourers are few, and the soil tenacious and stubborn. In the lower country they are but partially used, although the planters would probably find it their interest to adopt them more generally. In some cases they cultivate a cotton and Indian corn crop by the plough ; but they are oftener done with the hoe, which may be considered as the principal instrument of husbandry in the lower country. The spade is used chiefly for ditching and draining the rice lands. But the hoe is used for cultivating them. In some tide, and inland plantations, however, where the ground is strong, and has been kept sufficiently dry, ploughs are used with great advantage. 
Waggons and sledges are principally used in the middle and upper country, the first for transporting heavy articles to a distance, and the last for drawing wood, rails, and small timber about a settlement. In the lower country, ox carts, capable of carrying three or four barrels of rice, are almost solely the mode of landcarriage for the rice planters. They are drawn by three or four yoke of oxen, and attended by two or three Negro drivers. 
There are upwards of 16 different grasses indigenous to S. Carolina ; but in general little attention is paid to the forming of pasture and meadow lands. The cattle are sent into the woods to graze, and the culture of cotton, rice, and maize, becomes the chief object of the planter and farmer's attention. Some lands in the vicinity of Charleston are, however, converted into fields for mowing, as the high price of hay in that neighbourhood renders this branch of agriculture a profitable business ; but the greatest proportion of hay is brought from the N. States in the packet vessels. In general the cattle is fed during winter upon the leaves and blades of the Indian corn, ricestraw, &c. Horses and poultry are fed with the corn, which, together with rice, also form the principal food of the Negroes. The white inhabitants are extremely fond of the corn bruised and boiled into a pudding, which they call hominy. It is eaten with milk, sugar, and butter, and is a favourite dish at breakfast.  
While agriculture is so much attended to, and the means of engaging in it so easy, it is not surprising that few direct their attention to manufactures. Some years ago, a cotton manufactory was established near Statesborough, which bid fair to rise into consideration. It was, however, soon perceived that the price of labour was too great to permit its goods to stand any competition with those of similar qualities imported from Great Britain ; consequently the proprietors were obliged to discontinue their operations. A numerous population, and scarcity of lands, must first be experienced in a country, before its inhabitants will resort to manufactures, while a more eligible mode of subsistence exists. In the upper country, however, necessity has obliged the inhabitants to provide for their respective wants from their own resources, in consequence of the difficulty and expense of conveying bulky articles from the seacoast to the interior. The traveller there soon becomes accustomed to the hummingmusic of the spinning wheel and the loom. Cottons and woollens of various descriptions are made in sufficient quantities for domestic use ; and if we except the articles of salt and sugar., the people in the upper parts of the state may be considered independent of foreign support ; for carpenters, smiths, masons, tanners, shoemakers, sadlers, hatters, millwrights, and other tradesmen, are conveniently situated throughout the country; and the materials necessary for their respective professions are met with in abundance. 
At the distance of about 110 miles from the sea, the river swamps terminate, and the high lands extend quite to the rivers, and form banks in some places several hundred feet high from the surface of the water, and afford many extensive and delightful views. These high banks are interwoven with layers of leaves, and different coloured earth, and abound with quarries of freestone, pebbles, flint, crystals, ironore in abundance, silver, lead, sulphur, and coarse diamonds. The swamps above the head of the tide are occasionally planted with corn, cotton, and indigo. The soil is very rich, yielding from 40 to 50 bushels of corn an acre. It is curious to observe the gradations from the seacoast to the upper country, with respect to the produce, the mode of cultivation, and the cultivators. 
On the islands upon the seacoast, and for 40 or 50 miles back, and on the rivers much farther, the cultivators are all slaves. No white man, to speak generally, ever thinks of settling a farm and improving it for himself without Negroes :]  SOUTH CAROLINA.  
[if he has no Negroes, he hires himself as overseer to some rich planter who has more than he can or will attend to, till he can purchase for himself. The articles cultivated are corn, rye, oats, every species of pulse and potatoes, which, with the small rice, are food for the Negroes ; rice, indigo, cotton, and some hemp, for exportation. The culture of cotton is capable of being increased equal to almost any demand. The soil was cultivated till lately almost wholly by manual labour. The plough, till since the peace, was scarcely used. Now the plough and harrow, and other improvements, are introduced into the rice swamps with great success, and will, no doubt, become general* In the middle settlements, Negroes are not so numerous. The master attends personally to his own business. The land is not properly situated for rice. It produces tolerable good indigo weed, and some tobacco is raised for exportation. The farmer is contented to raise corn, potatoes, oats, rye, poultry, and a little wheat. 
In the upper country there are but few Negroes ; generally speaking, the farmers have none, and depend, like the inhabitants of the N. States, upon the labour of themselves and families for subsistence ; the plough is used almost wholly. Indian corn in great quantities, wheat, rye, barley, oats, potatoes, &c. are raised for food ; and tobacco, wheat, cotton, hemp, flax, and indigo, for exportation. From late experiments it has been found that vines may be cultivated, and wine made to great advantage. Snakeroot, pinkroot, and a variety of medicinal herbs grow spontaneously ; also ginseng on and near the mountains. 
This country abounds with precious ores, such as gold, silver, lead, blacklead, copper, and iron ; but it is the misfortune of those who direct their pursuits in search of them, that they are deficient in the knowledge of chemistry, and too frequently make use of improper menstruums in extracting the respective metals. There are likewise to be found pellucid stones of different hues, rock crystal, pyrites, petrified substances, coarse cornelian, marble beautifully variegated, vitreous stone, and vitreous sand; red and yellow ochres, which, when roasted and ground down with linseed oil, make a very excellent paint ; also potter's clay of a most delicate texture, fuller's earth, and a number of dyestuffs, among which is a singular weed which yields four different colours, its leaves are surprisingly styptic, strongly resembling the taste of alum ; likewise, an abundance of chalk, crude alum, sulphur, nitre, vi-  triol, and along the banks of rivers large quantities of marie may be collected. There are also a variety of roots, the medicinal effects of which it is the barbarous policy of those who are in the secret to keep a profound mystery. The rattlesnake root, so famous amongst the Indians for the cure of poison, is of the number. The next is the venereal root, which, under a vegetable regimen, w ill cure a confirmed lues. Another root, when reduced to an impalpable powder, is singularly efficacious in destroying worms in children. There is likewise a root, an ointment of which, with a poultice of the same, will in a short space of time discuss the most extraordinary tumours,particularly what is termed the whiteswelling; this root is very scarce — There is another root, a decoction of which, in new milk, will cure the bloody dysentery ; the patient must avoid cold, and much judgment is requisite in the portion to be administered. There is also a plant, the leaves of which, being bruised and applied to the part affected, relieves rheumatic pains ; it occasions a considerable agitation of the parts, attended with most violent and acute pains, but never fails to procure immediate ease. There is also a plant, the leaves of which have a most fetid smell ; these leaves being boiled, and any person afflicted with cutaneous complaints, once bathing therein, will be radically cured. There is a root which acts as an excellent purge, and is well calculated for the labouring part of mankind, as it is only necessary to chew it in its crude state, and it requies no manner of aid to facilitate its operation. An equally efficacious and simple purge is obtained from a weed, the stalk of which is red, is about three feet high, and the flower white ; the leaves run from the bottom of the stalk in opposite and corresponding lines ; the seed is about the size of a wheat grain, globular in the centre, and oblate at both ends; it is full of oil, and tastes like a walnut kernel : 20 grains of this, chewed and swallowed, is, in point of mildness and efficacy, equal to any rhubarb ; and the pleasantness of its taste, as a deception to weak stomachs, appears to have been a design of Providence : in its operation it resembles castoroil. A very sovereign remedy is extracted from the bark of a tree, which may be used to great advantage in the diseases incident to this climate. Every climate, some believe, has its peculiar disease, and every disease its peculiar antidote under the same climate. In addition to the above is another species of bark, of a sweet and nauseous taste : the tree grows contiguous to a very powerful chalybeute spring :]      SOUTH CAROLINA.  [the bark, when sufficiently masticated, operates as a very potential purge and emetic, and in the hands of a skilful chemist may be rendered very serviceable. In this country is a tree which bears a large pod, inclosing a kind of mucilage, the juice of which is very sharp ; the bai'k smells like tanned leather, and when prepared like hemp, makes the very best of cordage ; also another tree, which bears an ear like a corncob, covered with berries containing a large proportion of oil. There is likewise a very singular tree, which affords a most superb shade ; it produces a round ball, which, in the heat of summer, opens and enlarges a number of male insects, which become very troublesome wherever they lodge : this happens generally some distance from their parent tree. 
The hand of nature never formed a country with more natural advantages, or blessed it with a more serene or healthful climate. It abounds with game of all kinds, is a very fine fruit country, and is peculiarly adapted to the growth of vines, the olive, silk, and coffee trees, and the production of cotton. It is a perfect garden of medical herbs, and its medicinal springs are not inferior to any in Europe. 
The ironworks, known by the name of the JEra. Etna Ironwork, are situated in York County, within two miles of the Catawba River. Within the compass of two miles from the furnace, there is an inexhaustible quantity of ore, which works easy and well in the furnace. The metal is good for hammers, gudgeons, or any kind of machinery and hollow ware, and will make good bariron. Some trial has been made of it in steel, and it promises well. Nothing is necessary for preparing the ore for use but burning. The ore consists of large rocks above the surface ; the depth not yet known. In the cavities between, lie an ochre and seed ore. It is said there will be no occasion to sink shafts or drive levels for 50 years to come. The iEra furnace was built in 1787 ; the iEtna in 1788. The nearest landing at present (1795) is Camden, 70 miles from the furnace. The proprietors of the works, and seven others, have obtained a charter to open the Catawba to the N. Carolina Line, and a charter from N. Carolina to open the river 80 miles higher in that state, and boats came within 40 miles of the works in the course of the summer of 1795, as there were boats already built for the purpose which were to carry 30 tons, and in the course of the following summer they were brought within two miles of the works. The works are within two miles of the river, and 

VOL. IV.  the creek can be made navigable to the works. Mr. William Hill, one of the principal proprietors of these works, has contrived a method, by means of a fall of water, of blowing all the fires both of the forges and furnaces, so as to render unnecessary the use of wheels, cylinders, or any other kind of bellows. The machinery is simple and cheap, and not liable to {he accident of freezing. In the middle, and especially in the upper country, the people are obliged to manufacture their own cotton and woollen cloths, and most of their husbandly tools ; but in the lower country, the inhabitants, for these articles, depend almost entirely on their merchants. 
Late accounts from the interior parts of this state inform, that cotton, hemp, and flax, are plenty; that they have a considerable stock of good sheep ; that great exertions are made, and much done in the household way ; that they have long been in the habit of doing something in family manufactures, but within a few years past great improvements have been made. The women do the weaving, and leave the men to attend to agriculture. This state furnishes all the materials, and of the best kind, for ship building. The live oak, and the pitch and yellow pines, are of a superior quality. Ships might be built here with more ease, and to much greater advantage, than in the middle and e. states. A want of seamen, is one reason why this business is not more generally attended to. So much attention is now paid to the manufacture of indigo, in this state, that it bids fair to rival that of the French. It is to be regretted, that it is still the practice of the merchants concerned in the Carolina trade, to sell at foreign markets the Carolina indigo of the first quality, as French. The society for the information and assistance of persons emigrating from other countries, in a printed paper, which bears their signature, say, that " A monied capital may be profitably employed, 1st. In erecting mills, for making paper, for sawing lumber, and especially for manufacturingwheat flour. There are hundreds of valuable mill seats unimproved, and the woods abound with pine trees. A bushel of wheat may be purchased in S. Caro-  lina for half a dollar, which will  make as good  flour as that which in the vicinity of proper mills sells for double that price. Such is the cheapness and fertility of the soil, that half a dollar a bushel for wheat would afford a great profit to the cultivators thereof. 2. In tanning and manufacturing leather. Cattle are raised with so much ease, in a country where the winters are both mild and short, that hides are remarkably] 3n-  SOUTH CAROLINA.  
[cheap. The profits of tanners and shoemakers _ must be considerable, when it is a well known fact, that the hides of full grown cattle, and a single pair of shoes sell for nearly the same price. 
3. In making bricks — These now sell for nine dollars a thousand, and the call for them is so great, that the bricklayers are not fully supplied. 
4. In making potash— The ashes that might be collected in Charleston, and from the woods burnt in clearing new lands in the country, would furnish the means of carrying on the manufacture of potash to great advantage." 
Gentlemen of fortune, before the late war, sent their sons to Europe for education. During the war and since, they have generally sent them to the Middle and N. States. Those who have been at this expense in educating their sons, have been but comparitively few in number ; so that the literature of the state is at a low ebb. Since the peace, however, it has begun to flourish. There are several respectable academies in Charleston, one at Beaufort, on Port Royal Island, and several others in different parts of the state. Three colleges have lately been incorporated by law, one at Charleston, one at Winnsborough, in the district of Camden, the other at Cambridge, in the district of Ninety Six. The public and private donations for the support of these three colleges, were originally intended to have been appropriated jointly, for the erecting and supporting of one respectable college. The division of these donations has frustrated this design. Part of the old barracks in Charleston has been handsomely fitted up, and converted into a college, and there are a number of students ; but it does not yet merit a more dignified name than that of a respectable academy. The Mount Sion College at Winnsborough, is supported by a respectable society of gentlemen, who have long been incorporated. This institution flourishes and bids fair for usefulness. The college at Cambridge is no more than a grammar school. That the literature of this state might be put upon a respectable footing, nothing is wanting but a spirit of enterprise among its wealthy inhabitants. The legislature, in their session in January 1795, appointed a committee to enquire into the practicability of, and to report a plan for, the establishment of schools in the different parts of the static 
Since the revolution, by which all denominations were put on an equal footing, there have been no disputes between different religious sects. They all agree to differ. The upper parts of this state are settled chiefly by Presbyterians, Bap*  tists, and Methodists. From the most probablecalculations, it is supposed that the religious denominations of this state, as to numbers, may be ranked as follows : Presbyterians, including the Congregational and Independent Churches, Episcopalians, Baptists, Methodists, &c. 
The little attention that has been paid to manufactures, occasions a vast consumption of foreign imported articles ; but the quality and value of their exports generally leave a balance in favour of the state, except when there have been large importations of Negroes. The amount of exports from the port of Charleston, in the year ending November, 1787, was then estimated, from authentic documents, at £.505,279. 19s. 5d. sterling money. The number of vessels cleared from the customhouse, the same year, was 947, measuring 62,118 tons ; 735 of these, measuring 41,531 tons, were Americans ; the others belonged to Great Britain, Spain, France, the United Netherlands, and Ireland. The principal articles exported from this state, are rice, indigo, tobacco, skins of various kinds, beef, pork, cotton, pitch, tar, rosin, turpentine, myrtlewax, lumber, naval stores, cork, leather, pinkroot, snakeroot, ginseng, &c. In the most successful seasons, there have been as many as 140,000 barrels of rice, and 1,300,000 pounds of indigo exported in a year. From the 15th of December, 1791, to September, 1792, 108,567 tierces of rice, averaging 550 lb. nett weight each, were exported from Charleston. In the year ending September 30, 1791, the amount of exports from this state was 2,693,267 dollars, 97 cents, and the year ending September, 1795, to 5,998,492 dollars, 49 cents. Upon the whole, it is certain, that previously to the revolutionary war the exports of S. Carolina amounted, upon an average, to £500,000 sterling, and consisted principally of rice, indigo, tobacco, deerskins, pitch, tar, turpentine, salt provisions, Indian corn, and lumber. During the war, agriculture and commerce were both materially injured. The usual supplies of clothing from the mothercountry being stopped, manufactories were established, and the Negroes were for the most part clothed with mixed cloths of cotton and wool, spun and woven for the occasion. Many negroes were taken from agricultural pursuits, as well to assist at these manufactures, as to carry on the erection of fortifications, and other public works; in consequence of which, the articles for exportation naturally decreased, or, when collected, were consumed at home, alternately, by friends and foes.]    SOUTH CAROLINA.  [At the conclusion of the war it appeared, that the agriculture and commerce of S. Carolina had retrograded nearly 47 years backwards, the exports of 1783 being scarcely equal to those of 1736. The internal consumption, however, must have been greater, but the loss to the state was the same. Since that period her agriculture and commerce have rapidly augmented, though in some degree counteracted by the partial prohibition of the importation of Negroes for several years past, and which was fully carried into execution on the 1st of January, 1808. From year to year, new prospects have presented themselves ; new objects of agriculture have arisen ; and the loss of one staple has been supplied by another of superior value : cotton is now the most valuable export of S. Carolina. 
Since the French revolution Charleston has  been the medium of the greatest part of that trade, which has been carried on between the French W. India islands and the mother country, under the neutral flag of the United States. In this manner quantities of cocoa, coffee, sugar, rum, indigo, and other articles, the produce of the French, Spanish, and Dutch possessions in the W. Indies and S. America, are included in the exports of S. Carolina, from the year 1793, which, in time of peace, are directly exported from the colonies to the mothercountry. Within these few years much of this neutral traffic has been gradually abolished, by the restrictive decrees and orders of council of the two great belligerent powers, in return for which the Americans have retaliated by a general embargo. It may not be amiss here to insert

Charleston is by far the most considerable city on the seacoast, for an extent of 600 miles. From it are annually exported about the value of two millions and a half of dollars, in native commodities; and it supplies, with imported goods, a great part of the inhabitants of N . Carolina and Georgia, as well as those of S. Carolina. The harbour thereof is open all the  winter, and its contiguity to the W. India islands gives the merchants superior advantages for carrying on a peculiarly lucrative commerce. A waggonroad of 15 miles only is all that is wanted, to open a communication with the inhabitants of Tennessee. Knoxville, the capital of that state, is 100 miles nearer to Charleston than to anv other considerable seaport town on the] " 3 n 2  SOU  
[Atlantic Ocean. The reformation in France occasioned a civil war between the Protestant and Catholic parties in that kingdom'. During these domestic troubles, Jasper de Coligni, a principal commander of the Protestant army, fitted out two ships, and sent them with a colony to America, under the command of Jean Riband, for the purpose of securing a retreat from persecution. Ribaud landed at what is now called Albemarle River, in N. Carolina. This colony, after enduring incredible hardships, were extirpated by the Spaniards. No further attempts were made to plant a colony in this quarter, till the reign of Charles II. of England. 
The militia of S. Carolina is divided into two divisions, each commanded by a majorgeneral. These divisions comprehend nine brigades, 39 regiments of infantry, eight regiments and a squadron of cavalry, and one regiment and a battalion of artillery, besides artillery companies which are attached to some of the regiments of infantry. The brigades are commanded by as many brigadiergenerals ; and the regiments are commanded by lieutenantcolonels. The governor is commander in chief of all the militia of the state, both by sea and land. 
Every ablebodied white male citizen, between the age of 18 and 45, is enrolled in the militia, and free people of colour are enrolled as pioneers. One third of the militia may be marched out of the state by order of the executive of the United States, on particular emergencies, and under certain conditions ; and treated in every respect the same as the regular troops, except that in cases of courtmartial, the court is to be selected from the militia of the state. Officers rise by seniority ; and no election exists except in the first appointment of subalterns. The number of effective militia in S. Carolina is about 40,000, of whom 2000 are cavalry. 
In Charleston, the inhabitants have formed themselves into volunteer corps, armed and clothed at their own expense. One half consists of cavalry and artillery. The uniform of the latter is a long blue coat with red facings, and large cocked hat and red feather ; it has a heavy appearance, and is but ill adapted to such a corps, whose chief perfection is in celerity of movement.

[SOUTHERN STATES; the States of Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, N. Carolina, Tennessee, S. Carolina, and Georgia : bounded n. by Pennsylvania, are thus denominated. This district of the Union contained, by the census of 1792, upwards of 1,900,000 inhabitants, of whom  648,439 were slaves, which is thirteen fourteenths of the whole number of slaves in the United States. The influence of slavery has produced a very distinguishing feature in the general character of the inhabitants, which, though now discernible to their disadvantage, has been softened and meliorated by the benign effects of the revolution, and the progress of liberty and humanity. The following may be considered as the principal productions of this division : tobacco, rice, indigo, wheat, corn, cotton, tar, pitch, turpentine, and lumber. In this district is fixed the permanent seat of the general government, viz. the city of Washington. See United States.]

Hadley, on the e. side of Connecticut River, made for the purpose of navigating round the falls in the river, were begun in 1793, and completed in 1795. The falls are about three miles in length ; and since the completion of these locks and canals, there has been a considerable increase of transportation up and down the river. Some mills are already erected on these canals, and a great variety of waterworks may, and doubtless will soon be erected here, as nature and art have made it one of the most advantageous places for these purposes in the United States. Canals are also opening by the same company, at Miller's Falls in Montgomery, about 25 miles above these, and on the same side of the river.]

In the W. Indies, the island of Cuba, Porto Rico, Trinidad, Margareta, Tortuga, &c. 3. In S. America, Tierra Firme, Peru, Chile, Granada, Paraguay, and Patagonia. These extensive countries are described under their proper heads. All the exports of Spain, most articles of which no other European country can supply, were estimated some years back at 80,000,000 livres, or £.3,333,333 sterling. The most important trade of Spain is that which it carries on with its American provinces. The chief imports from these extensive countries consist of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, cotton, cocoa, cochineal, redwood, skins, rice, medicinal herbs and barks, as sassafras, Peruvian bark, &c. Vaynilla, Vicuna wool, sugar, and tobacco. In 1784, the total amount of the value of Spanish goods exported to America was 195,000,000 rcales de Xiellon ; foreign commodities, 238,000,000 r. d. v. The imports from America were valued at 900,000,000 r. d. v. in gold, silver, and precious stones ; and upwards of 300,000,000 in goods. In the Gazeta de Madrid, 1787, (Feb. 20,) it was stated, that the exports to America (the Indies) from the following 12 harbours, Cadiz, Corunna, Malaga, Seville, St. Lucar, Santander, Canaries, Alicante, Barcelona, Tortosa, Gipon, St. Sebastian, amounted, in 1785, to 767,249,787 r. d. v. ; the duties paid on these exports amounted to 28,543,702 r. d. v.

==[[Supay-Urcu|SUPAY-URCU]]==, signifying Devil's Mount, a mountain of the province and corregimiento of Cuenca in the kingdom of Quito ; between the valleys of Chuquipata and Paute, celebrated for imaginary riches said to be concealed in it, and of which the following story is related. — " A countryman who found himself, in his native place, oppressed with misery, invoked, in a state of desperation, the Devil to come to his assistance, and, cursing the hour of his birth, was revolving upon putting himself to death. The common enemy, profiting himself of the moment, appeared in a human shape before the distressed man, and, having asked him the cause of his sorrow, and having ascertained that it arose from poverty, affected to be struck with compassion, and told the poor creature he could show him a place whence he might extract as much gold as he pleased. The countryman accepted the offer with joy, and believing that the journey would be short, put up only a small quantity of provision to take with him, about four small loaves, and then went complacently to sleep, expecting the time when his conductor should call him ; but what was his astonishment, to find himself, upon waking, in a country entirely unknown to him ; and in fact by the mountain of Supayurcu. His mind was rendered somewhat tranquil on his perceiving at a small distance an old house, and, making up to it, he  found it to belong to another countryman, who received him with great courtesy. Whilst they were sitting at supper, the host, who had bechance taken in his hand one of the loaves belonging to the guest, and knowing that it was such bread as was made in Spain, but seeing it was altogether quite new, asked, in surprise, his guest, how it was that he had made so long a voyage in so short a time? The guest then related all that had happened, and they both consented that he must have been carried thither by the devil, and that in the neighbouring mountain must be the riches which were promised him he should find." — This story is current in the kingdom of Quito ; and the father Manuel Rodrigues relates it. However great may be the fiction, it is universally believed that the said mountain abounds in exquisite riches ; and this although no attempts have been made to extract them. Indeed, the natural aspect of the mountain, and bits of metal found on its skirt, bear strong indications of its containing mines. But these indications are peculiar to other mountains, and we have only related the story of the countryman to account for the name which this mountain bears. In lat. 2° 28' s.

==[[Supera|SUPERA]]==, a settlement of the province and government of Antioquia, in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada. 
==[[Superagua|SUPERAGUA|Suparaba]]==, as others call it, a small island near the coast of Brazil, in the province and captainship of Rey, and at the entrance of the Bay of Sagasii. 
==[[Superior|SUPERIOR]]==, a large lake of Canada in N. America ; or, more properly, a small fresh water sea. [From the most w. point of this lake, in a straight line to the Falls of St. Maria, it is 344 geographical miles in length. Its breadth is very various, being from 10 to about 100 miles from n. to s.~\ It is full of islands, and the whole of its *. coast is straight and sandy ; but the n. coast is more convenient for sailing, as it consists of rocks which form little bays or inlets, in which vessels may lie secure in times of tempests. But these never occur without a warning of two days. The first day, the waters of the lake become somewhat disquieted, a murmuring noise being heard over every part, and, the following day, the whole lake is covered with a thick mud, being still navigable if the wind be favourable ; but on the third day, when it is least expected, the waters become suddenly agitated like those  
SUPERIOR.  of the ocean ; and then it is that vessels on the n. side of the lake make into the shore for the aforesaid inlets, whilst those on the e. side take the precaution, on the second day, to ride out from the shore. 
The country surrounding is but little known, and is frequented only by the Indians who go thither to hunt. These Indians hold the lake as a kind of deity, offering to it sacrifices, by way of gratitude for the great quantities of fish which they extract from it, and in token of the respect which they bear to it from its vast extent. They assert that Michabou, God of the Waters, formed it for the hunting of castors. 
In the channel by which it empties itself into Lake Huron, is a cascade formed by great rocks, which, according to the tradition of those barbarians, are the remains of some causeways which were built by their god, to restrain the waters of the rivers and those of the Lake Almipegon, which formed this lake. The French missionaries of the Jesuits, called this cascade the Falls of St. Marie, from a church which they had there. In some parts of the coasts, and in various islands of the lake, are found large bits of copper, which form an object of great superstition to the savages ; and they look upon this metal as being sent them by the deities residing beneath the lake ; collecting even the smallest pieces with the greatest care, and keeping them without ever making any use of them. They say that there was formerly standing out of the water a rock of this material ; but as it does not now exist, it is thought by them to have been removed by their deities to some other spot ; whereas, in all probability, the waves of the lake have by time covered it over with sand. Certain it is that a great quantity of the above metal has been found in various parts ; and, in the aforesaid church, the missionaries used to make of it their crosses and incensories. 
[Lake Superior, formerly termed the Upper Lake, from its n. situation, may justly be termed the Caspian Sea of America, and is supposed to be the largest body of fresh water on the globe. According to the French charts it is 1500 miles in circumference. A great part of the coast is bounded by rocks and uneven ground. It is situated between lat. 46° and 49° n. and between long. 84° and 92' 15" w. The water is very clear, and transparent. If the sun shines bright, it is impossible through this medium to look at the rocks at the bottom, above a minute or two. Although the water, at the surface, is much warmed by the heat of the sun, yet, when  drawn up at about a fathom depth, it is very cold. Storms are more dreadful here than on the ocean. 
There are many islands in this lake ; two of them have each land enough, if proper for cultivation, to form a considerable province ; especially Isle Royal, which is not less than 36 miles long, and in many places 12 broad. The natives suppose these islands to be the residence of the Great Spirit. 
Many rivers empty their waters into this mighty reservoir ; of these one is called Nipegon, another Michipicooton ; which are described under their respective heads. 
Not far from the Nipegon is a small river, that, just before it enters the lake, has a perpendicular fall from the top of a mountain, of more than 100 feet. It is very narrow, and appears at a distance like a white garter suspended in the air. On the s. side of it is a remarkable point or cape of about 60 miles in length, called Point Chegomegan or Kuwenaw. About 100 miles w. of this cape, a considerable river falls into the lake, the head of which is composed of a great assemblage of small streams. This river is remarkable for the abundance of virgin copper that is found on and near its banks. Many small islands, particularly on the e. shores, abound with copperore lying in beds, with the appearance of copperas ; thus warranting the assertions made by Albedo on this subject respecting the opinions of the Indians. This metal might be easily made a very advantageous article of commerce. This lake abounds with fish, particularly trout and sturgeon ; the former weigh from 12 to 50 pounds, and are caught almost any season of the year in great plenty. Storms affect this lake as much as they do the Atlantic Ocean ; the waves run as high, and the navigation is equally dangerous. 
The entrance into this lake from the Straits of St. Marie affords one of the most pleasing prospects in the world. On the left may be seen many beautiful little islands that extend a considerable way before you ; and on the right, an agreeable succession of small points of land that project a little way into the water, and contribute, with the islands, to render this delightful bason calm, and secure from those tempestuous winds by which the adjoining lake is frequently troubled. 
This lake discharges its waters from the s. e. corner through the abovementioned Straits of 
St. Marie, which are about 40 miles long, into 
. Lake Huron. Although about 40 rivers empty] 
3p2  
^m  SUPERIOR.  
[into Lake Superioi', many of which are large, yet it does not appear that onetenth part of the waters which it receives, is discharged by the abovementioned strait : great part of the waters, it is thought, find to themselves subterraneous vents, whilst more evaporate ; and Providence, doubtless, makes use of this inland sea to furnish the interior parts of the country with that supply of vapours, without which, like the interior parts of Africa, they must have been a mere desert. A number of tribes live around Lake Superior, but little is known respecting them. 
The following extract from the journal of a late traveller will be acceptable to the curious. 
" Mr. M,about the year 1790, departed from Montreal with a company of about 100 men, under his direction, for the purpose of making a tour through the Indian country, to collect furs, and to make such remarks on its soil, waters, lakes, mountains, manners and customs of its inhabitants as might come within his knowledge and observation. He pursued his route from Montreal, entered the Indian country, and coasted about 300 leagues along the banks of Lake Superior, from thence to the Lake of the Woods, of which he took an actual survey, and found it to be 36 leagues in length ; from thence to the Lake Ounipique, of which he gave also a description. The tribes of the Indians which he passed through, were called the Maskego Tribe, Shepeweyau, Cithinistinee, Great Belly Indians, Beaver Indians, Blood Indians, the Black Feet Tribe, the Snake Indians, Ossnobians,Shiveytoon Tribe, Mandon Tribe, Paunees, and several others, who in general were very pacific and friendly towards him, and are great admirers of the best huntinghorses, in which the country abounds. The horses prepared by them for hunters, have large holes cut above their natural nostrils, for which they give as a reason, that those prepared in this manner will keep their breath longer than the others which are not thus prepared : from experience, knowledge is gained, and the longpractice of this custom, consequent on these trials, must have convinced them of the truth and utility of the experiment ; otherwise we can hardly suppose they would torture their best horses in this manner, if some advantage was not derived from the measure. 
In pursuing his route, he found no difficulty in obtaining a guide to accompany him from one nation to the other, until he came to the Shining- Mountains, or Mountains of Bright Stones, where, in attempting to pass, he was frustrated by the hostile appearance of the Indians who inhabit  that part of the country. The consequence of which was, he was disappointed in his intention, and obliged to turn his back upon them. Having collected a number of Indians, he went forward again, with an intention to force his way over those mountains, if necessary and practicable, and to make his way to Cook's River, on the n. w. coast of America, supposed by him to be about 300 leagues from the mountains ; but the inhabitants of the mountains again met him with their bows and arrows, and so superior were they in numbers to his little force, that he was obliged to flee before them. Finding himself thus totally disappointed in the information he was in hopes to obtain, he was obliged to turn his back upon that part of the country for which his heart had long panted. Cold weather coming on, he built huts for himself and party in the Ossnobian country, and near to the source of a large river, called the Ossnobian River, where they tarried duringthe continuance of the cold season, and until some time in the warmer months. Previous to his departure from Montreal, he had supplied himself with several kinds of seeds, and before his huts he laid out a small garden, which the natives observing, called them slaves, for digging up the ground, nothing of that kind being done by them, they living wholly on animal food ; bread is unknown to them : to some he gave remnants of hard bread, which they chewed and spit out again, calling it rotten wood. When his onions, &c. were somewhat advanced in their growth, he was often surprised to find them pulled up ; determining therefore to know from what cause it proceeded, he directed his men to keep watch, who found that the Indian children, induced by motives of curiosity, came with sticks, thrust them through the poles of his fence, to ascertain and satisfy themselves, what the things of the white men were, and in what manner they grew, &c. The natives of this country have no fixed or permanent place of abode, but live wholly in tents made of buffalo and other hides, and with which they travel from one place to another, like the Arabs ; and so soon as the feed for their horses is expended, they remove their tents to another fertile spot, and so on continually, scarcely ever returning to the same spots again." 
By the treaty of 1783, it was agreed that a water communication should be had into the Mississippi, by a line drawn due w. from the Lake of the Woods: but this was afterwards found to be impossible, since it is now ascertained that there arc no waters flowing into]

Its territory passed into the hands of the Dutch in 1674, having been ceded to them in exchange for New York. It   478  
SURINAM.  was at that time Ml of woods, impenetrable both to the sun and air, and was consequently infested by hurtful vapours and exhalations ; but notwithstanding all this the inhabitants of Zealand determined to establish themselves here, under the protection of the States, and, seeing that the country was capable of producing great quantities of sugar, they cut down the trees in numbers sufficient to lay open the land and to make the territory more healthy. The States of Zealand, to whom the country belonged, sold it to the Dutch W. India Company ; but this company not having in its power to remit the necessary succours and provisions, was under the necessity of selling a third part of the possessions to the magistracy of Amsterdam, another part to Mr. Van Aarsans, and another to Mr. Someldyck. Thus it gained the name of the Society of Surinam, as being under three proprietors, although the sovereignty was vested in the States General. As soon as this division was made, various families established themselves here, and formed many sugarcane plantations, which produced immense profit; and, the air being now rendered salutary, great numbers of people were attracted hither ; so that in 1682 the colony was said to possess no less than 600 families. 
This encreasing prosperity secured it the protection and favour of the States, and induced them, in 1683, to grant it a patent, which consists of 32 articles, not merely in favour of the W. India Company, but for the security of all such as should choose to settle in it. Amongst other advantages enjoyed by the company, was that of the right of imposing a duty of three Dutch guilders upon every 100 tons of goods that were brought from, or carried to, the port of Surinam; as also the right of demanding 50 lbs. sugar yearly of each of the inhabitants of the colony, as well whites as Negroes ; and 2| per cent, on the value of the merchandises which were sent to Holland or sold here. Moreover it had the exclusive right of trading in Negroes, although it was under the obligation of selling them in an open market, and in pairs, to all persons whoever would buy. All the natives of the .United Provinces have the liberty of establishing themselves here or of trading to this place, upon paying the aforesaid centage on their cargoes, and under the restriction from touching at the African coast, or any other part to the infringement of the company's exclusive charter. They may also trade directly with the ports of the United States. The company was under the obligation of providing the establishments with ammunition  and artillery ; also of paying the troops, taking care of whatsoever related to the security of the colony, and of sending ministers, who were paid by the colony. 
The great number of Dutch and French who have come to establish themselves here, have caused it to be in a very flourishing state, insomuch as that it now extends upwards of 30 leagues above the mouth of the river Surinam. It is probable, however, that it will extend no farther, as the river is here rendered impassable through a number of cascades : add to this, that there is here a sort of natural bulwark formed of vast rocks, serving at once as a frontier to the colony and a defence against the savage Indians who dwell amongst the mountains. 
The plantations, we are assured, exceed in number 500, and yield immense profit. All these are situate on the shores of the rivers Comewine and Cotica, this last being an arm of the Surinam, and both abounding in excellent fish, and having in the wood on their borders an immense variety of birds. 
The climate from the end of November to the beginning of July is very mild ; as well because that the clouds impede the rays of the sun, as that the n. e. wind almost continually prevails, and not without great abundance of rain. The principal commerce of this colony consists in the productions of the country ; which are sugar, tobacco, and dyeing wood. The Dutch also have here planted coffee, of which such quantities are produced as to admit of much being exported to Holland, where it is as much esteemed as the coffee of the east. 
The land is cultivated by Negro slaves, who are provided to the planters by the company. No beasts of burden ever lead a life so wretched as do these poor creatures : they are doomed to incessant drudgery, suffering the most rigorous treatment for the least breach of the orders of their imperious masters. These allow them only five or six hours on a Sunday to cultivate their own gardens, the only means they have whereby to maintain themselves, excepting indeed a little salt meat, which is sometimes left for them on a table, without any thing else whatever. This barbarous treatment oftentimes drives them to desperation, when they endeavour to gain their liberty at every risk. But when they are in danger of being caught, they either put themselves to death, or, when taken, will bear the most excruciating torments with the greatest firmness. 
For the government of this colony there is at  

SURINAM.  
Amsterdam a college composed of 10 directors ; of the which five are elected from the magistrates of the city, four from the W. India Company, and another is the Lord of Someldyck. Although this tribunal is opposed to the company, it gives to the regency of Surinam all its influence for the preservation of the colony, and the aforesaid directors nominate the governor; although he must be approved of by the States General, and be bound by oath as well to these as to the directors. This governor, who has under him a commandant, exercises, in the name of the States General and of the company, a supreme authority in the colony, as well in civil as in military concerns ; but is obliged, in cases of great weight, to convene the political council, of which, as well as of the tribunal of justice, he is president, although in either he has not more than one vote, and the question being decided by the plurality. This political council has, besides the president, the commandant, who is first counsellor, and nine other counsellors, independently of the jiscal and secretary. The tribunal of justice consists of the governor, five counsellors, a secretary, and a judge. The governor has the filling of all the places and employments as well civil as military, but not without having first received the order from the college of directors. He, however, makes all the regulations which he considers convenient to the security of the colony against the insults and invasions of an enemy, and, with the commandant and the captains, forms the council of war; moreover, weighing all military subjects with the political council, and proposing whatsoever he thinks necessary. Besides the above, is a subaltern council of war, composed of the commandant and all the officers, captains, lieutenants, and corporals, for the taking cognizance and punishment of all the faults committed by the troops. The chamber of orphans is governed by four commissaries, with a secretary. 
The troops paid for the defence of the colony consist of four companies of infantry, who have a captain, a lieutenant, a corporal, and two Serjeants. The governor is colonel of the four companies, and also captain of the first ; and in the staff there is a majorgeneral, a surgeon, and a provost. The whole colony is divided into eight parts, which are, High Pamaribo, Low Pamaribo, Thorarika, High Comewine, Low Comewine, Cotica, Perica, and Para ; each of which forms a company of militia, having a captain, lieutenant, and corporal. Here are only three Calvinist churches, each governed by a curate,  two ancients, and a lecturer, who is at the same time a schoolmaster : all these churches are well endowed. 
The country has many peculiarities in natural history ; and a collection of these articles were made by Mary Sibila Merian, a native of Frankfort, who made a voyage to Surinam with no other object in view than that of acquainting herself with the various phenomena which here' present themselves : amongst the rest we must notice a species of frog, which is accustomed to live near an aquatic plant of a pale red colour and excellent for salad ; the female of which conceives and carries its young, before they are born, upon its back, where the uterus, which is very large, is situate ; and from whence the young frogs aie delivered at the time of parturition, one after another, by the breaking of the skin. One of these frogs were brought over to Europe in this singular state in some spirits of wine, when some of the little ones appeared with their head only out of the uterus, and others half their bodies. These animals are very good eating, and the Negroes use much diligence in searching for them. Their forepaws are like those of a frog, and their feet like those of the duck. In the fields is found a large rat, which carries its young upon its back ; the young ones flying to its mother in case of danger, and fastening themselves upon its neck by way of safety. Here is also a plant called dormilona (sleepy plant), well worthy of mention, and taking its name from the singular disposition of its leaves during the night ; for, upon the setting of the sun, these fold themselves, by pairs, one over the other, so as to form but one stem, and in this state remain the whole of the night. The aforesaid observatrix took the trouble of cultivating these trees, and discovered their virtues for curing of wounds. There is in this colony a settlement of Jews ; and the interior of the country towards the w. and n. w. is inhabited by Caribee Indians; of whom there are some tribes who are allied to the Dutch, and who trade with them. 
The French, commanded by the admiral Ducase, endeavoured to take possession of this colony in 1688, but were foiled in the attempt. The capital is Paramaribo. [See Dutch America.] 
Surinam, a large river of the province of Dutch Guayana, and from which the former colony and country take their name. That colony is situate on its w. shore, 15 miles from the mouth. It flows down from the mountains of Para, and, after watering the country of the barbarian. In*-   U1MBJ  S XJ R  sus  dians, and following a long winding course, enters the sea ; it is about 224 miles from its source in a direct line to its mouth, just before it enters the sea, precipitates itself down a cascade, and forms the fall of Surinam, being navigable to this place. It has at its entrance some sandbanks, which, at high tide, are covered with three feet water ; but, beyond these, the river grows deeper, and is navigable for more than 30 leagues inland; having, the whole of this distance, its shores well cultivated, and upon its w. shore the fort of Zealand to defend the entrance, which is in the Atlantic Sea, in lat. 6° 6' n.

[==[[Surry|SURRY]]==, a county of N. Carolina, in Salisbury district ; bounded e. by Stokes, and w_. by Wilkes. It contains 7191 inhabitants, including 698 slaves. The Moravian settlements of Wachovia are in this county. Near the river Yadkin is a forge, which manufactures bariron. The Ararat or Pilot Mountain, about 16 miles n. w. of Salem, draws the attention of every curious traveller in this part of the state. It is discernible at the distance of 60 or 70 miles, overlooking the country below. It was anciently called the Pilot by the Indians, as it served them for a beacon to conduct their routes in the n. and s. wars. On approaching it, a grand display of Nature's workmanship, in rude dress, is exhibited. From its broad base the mountain rises in easy ascent, like a pyramid, near a mile high, to where it is not more than the area of an acre broad; when, on a sudden, a vast stupendous rock, having the appearance of a large castle, with its battlements, erects its perpendicular height to upwards of 300 feet, and terminates in a flat, which is generally as level as a floor. To ascend this precipice there is only one way, which, through cavities and fissures of the rock, is with some difficulty and danger effected. When on the summit the eye is entertained with a vast delightful prospect of the Apalachian mountains on the n. and a wideextended level country below on the s. ; while the streams of the Yadkin and Dan, on the right and left hand, are discovered at several distant places, winding  their way through the fertile low grounds towards the ocean.] [Surry, a county of Virginia, bounded n. by James River, which separates it from Charles City County, e. by Isle of Wight, and w. by Prince George's County. It contains 6227 inhabitants, of whom 3097 are slaves.]

==[[Surubia|SURUBIA|Surubin]]==, a settlement of the Portuguese in the part of Guayana possessed by them : situate on the shore of the river of Las Amazonas, and at the mouth bearing its name. Surubia. This river rises in the country of the Coparipucus Indians, runs s. and enters that of Las Amazonas, between the strait of Pauxis and the river of Curupatuba. 

==[[Surumi|SURUMI]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Chayanta or Charcas in Peru ; annexed to the curacy of the settlement of San Marcos de Miraflores. It has a sanctuary of Nuestra Senora, to which singular devotion is paid, and to which a great multitude of people throng from the neighbouring parts. 
==[[Susa|SUSA]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Ubate in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada : situate in a pleasant and delightful valley in the road which leads from Santa Fe to Chuquinquira, between the settlements of Fuquene and Simijaca. It is of a moderately cold temperature, fertile, and abounding in all kinds of vegetable productions and seeds, both of a cold and hot climate. It contains more than 100 housekeepers, and has in its vicinity a mine of rock crystal, of so exquisite a quality as to appear like the most sparkling diamonds. It was, in the times of the Indians, a large, populous, and rich city ; and was conquered and pillaged by the zipa or king of Bogota, Nemequene. Fourteen leagues n. w. of Santa Fe. S. ==[[Susana|SUSANA]]==, a river of the province and government of Luisiana in N.America; between the rivers of Trinidad and Fores. S.

[SUSQUEHANNAH River, rises in Lake Ustayantho in the State of New York, and runs a very serpentine course; it crosses the boundary line between the States of Pennsylvania and New York. It receives the Tyoga river in ■lat.41°57 / w. Afterwards it proceeds s. e. to Pittsburg, and then  sus 
[5. w. till, at Sunbury, in lat. 40° 53', it meets the aj. branch of Susquehannah, which is navigable 90 miles from its mouth. By its course from Sunbury the river is passable with boats to Harrisburg and Middleton on the Swatara. About 15 miles above Harrisburg, it receives the Juniatta from the n. w. proceeding from the Alleghany mountains, and flowing through a broken country. Hence it takes its course about s. e. until it falls into the head of Chesapeak Bay, just below Havre de Grace. It is about a mile wide at its mouth, and navigable only 20 miles, the navigation being obstructed beyond that by the Rapids. 
The inland navigation between Schuylkill and Susquehannah, will bring by water to Philadelphia the trade of a most fertile country, of about 1000 miles square, or 600,000 acres of land. If this can be accomplished, an inland navigation may be easily made to the Ohio and to Lake Erie, which would at once open a communication with above 2000 miles extent of western country, viz. with all the great lakes, together with the countries which lie on the waters of Mississippi, Missouri, and all their branches. 
The water communication between Schuylkill and Susquehannah, which is the soul of all this, Will be about 60 miles, as the navigation must go, although the distance on a line is only 40 miles. This tract is cut by two creeks, " the Quitapahilla and the Tulpehoken. These two creeks lead within four miles of each other; the level of their head waters is nearly the same, and the space between them makes the height of land, or, as it is commonly called, the crown land between the two rivers, which is nearly on a plain, and the bottom of the canal, through which the navigation must pass, will no where rise more than SO feet above the level of the head waters of the two creeks above mentioned, nor so much as 200 feet above the level of the waters of Susquehannah or Schuylkill. 
The company, instituted the 29th of September, 1791, has a capital of 1000 shares, at 400 dollars each, payable at such time as the company shall direct. Coal of an excellent quality is found on several parts of this river, particularly at Wyoming.] 

[==[[Sussex|SUSSEX]]==, the n. w. county of New Jersey. It is mountainous and healthy, and has several    is floated down the Delaware in boats and rafts. Here are five Presbyterian churches, two for Anabaptists, one for German Lutherans, and one for Quakers. It contains 12 townships ; the chief of which are Newton, Greenwich, Hardy - ston, Knowltown, and Oxford. The population is 19,500, including 439 slaves. It is bounded n. e. by the State of New York, n. w. by Delaware River, which separates it from Northampton County in Pennsylvania, and s. e. and s. by Morris and Hunterdon Counties. Paulin's Kill is here navigable for small craft 15 miles. The Musconetcony, which divides the county from Hunterdon, is capable of beneficial improvements, as is the Pequest or Pequaset, between the abovementioned rivers. The courthouse in this county is 13 miles s. w. of Hamburg, 38 n. e. ofEaston in Pennsylvania, 25 s. w. of Goshen in New York, and 77 n. by e. of Philadelphia.

==[[Susticatan|SUSTICATAN]]==, a settlement of the head settlement of the district and alcaldia mayor of Xerez in the Nueva Espana ; and annexed to the curacy of its capital, from whence it lies three leagues to s. w. 
==[[Susupuato|SUSUPUATO]]==, a settlement of the head settlement of the district of Tuzantla and alcaldia mayor of Maravatio in Nueva Espana. It is much reduced, and contains only 1 1 Indian families. 
==[[Sutas|SUTAS]]==, a nation of Indians of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, who were conquered by the Adelantado Gonzalo Ximenez de Quesada. A short time afterwards, however, they rose in a body against the oppression they experienced from their new masters, and entrenched themselves in a fastness, composed of strong rocks, and so fortified by nature, as to have only one narrow entrance, where four men might defend themselves  iron mines ; and works have been erected for the against a multitude. In this retreat no less than  manufacture of bar and pig iron. It produces excellent crops of wheat ; and in no part of the state are greater herds of cattle. The produce vol. iv.,.  100,000 Indians had lodged themselves, with their families, provisions, and other necessaries, for many days; and, no sooner had Gonzalo 3 Q  SUT    
Ximenez de Quesada received intelligence of the fact, and also that other nations, in imitation of the Sutas, were already in a state of mutiny, together with the Tausas, than he resolved upon reducing them to obedience, and chastising them, before that the rebellion might become universal throughout the kingdom ; and to this end he appointed to the commission the Captain Juan de Cespedes, with two companies of infantry, trusting to the renowned valour and ability of this officer. Nor did the event discredit the election ; for, in spite of the very obstinate attempts made by the Indians to secure their liberty, he hit upon a plan, which was, however, attended with infinite danger. The first in this attack were Juan Gomez Portillo and Pedro Galeano, who made shocking havoc with the naked bodies of the Indians, and gave time for their companions to join the combat ; so that the poor Indians, rather than meet the cruel fate which awaited them, preferred to dash themselves headlong from the precipice ; and this even in preference to surrendering themselves prisoners. The tragical issue, however, of this contest, struck a terror into the breasts of all the other Indians ; and, from this moment, the kingdom regained its tranquillity. 

==[[Sutagaos|SUTAGAOS]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, who dwell between the rivers Pazca and Sumapaz. They are of a moderate stature ; and their accent is so mellifluous, as well to denote their native timidity and pusillanimity. Their principal occupation was, in the time of their gentilism, to sally forth in parties into the highways, not with an intention of putting the passengers to death, but merely of taking from them their booty. Moreover, they imagined that their idols were much better pleased with offerings which were the effects of such robberies. To these deities, which were of clay or wood, they uniformly repaired to make their offerings, before they dared to revisit their homes, after any of their excursions, though they would bring home with them part of their spoil, reserving it as something sacred. But it should have been remarked, that these savages never offered any thing of their own to their deities, inasmuch as they imagined that nothing was acceptable to them but what was stolen. Their arms were envenomed arrows ; and very much were these to be dreaded, from the virulent poison with which they were tipped, made of certain herbs found in abundance in their territory. So addicted were they to sorcery, that they tell us,  some of those who have been converted, that they had such a special connexion with the devil, that, if they wished to bring any one to his end, they had nothing more to do than to make a streak with the poison in the way the object of their hatred might pass, and that he would certainly fall a sacrifice to the spell, whilst others might pass totally uninjured. They were in strict alliance with the Pijaos^ their neighbours, in opposition to the Spaniards ; and ruled over the Sumapaez, Doas, and Cundayes, more through the dread excited by their poisonous herbs than any military valour. There was a town belonging to them, of their own name, which was taken, pillaged, and destroyed, by Gonzalo Ximenez de Quesada in 1538. These Indians are now very few, and live dispersed. 

==[[Sutamarchan|SUTAMARCHAN]]==, a settlement of the corregimiento of Sachicha and jurisdiction of the city of Leiba in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada ; situate in a delightful plain, and being of a cold, though agreeable temperature. Its territory is very fertile and cheerful, and abounds in vegetable productions. There was formerly in this settlement the image of Chiquinquira ; and it was then great and populous, and was called Marchan, having, subsequently, changed its name to that of Suta, being united to this latter settlement. It is now reduced to a very small population, is annexed to the curacy of Leiba, and is one league distance from the same, and eight from Chiquinquira, in the road leading to this place. 
==[[Sutatausa|SUTATAUSA]]==, a settlement of the corregimiento of Ubate in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada. It is of a cold temperature, abounding in wheat, barley, maize, and papas/ contains 200 housekeepers, and 100 Indians, and is very near the settlement of Ubate, and 12 leagues from Santa Fe.

It is of a moist and so excessively hot a temperature that corruption takes place in the shortest space of time ; so that they never kill here more animals than what they have an immediate necessity for. Its population is composed of 300 families of Indians, who speak the Mazateco idiom. It is extremely fertile and woody, and abounds in an infinite variety of exquisite fruits. Its principal commerce is in its crops of baynilla, so much esteemed for imparting a delicious aromatic flavour to chocolate. Here are, likewise, gathered some crops of cot-  ton and cacao, and there are cinnamontrees, which, were they cultivated, would be very fine ; nor is there wanting the pepper of Tabasco. Here grow some small trees, the wood of which is white ; but which, when steeped in water, becomes red, and from which are made brushes for cleaning the teeth, in great estimation. All the stone found in this settlement is of a rough grinding nature, and of this there is, in the n. part, a large rock of more than 100 feet long and 60 wide. This settlement is very subject to earthquakes, and is seven leagues from Xalapa.

In 1758 it was afterwards restored to the French, and again taken by Admiral Boscawen and Colonel Amherst, [when the garrison, consisting of 5600 men, were made prisoners ; and 11 men of war in the harbour, were either taken, sunk, burnt, or destroyed. — It was ceded to Great Britain by the peace of 1763.]  The Strait of Fronsac, which separates this island from Nova Scotia, is only a league wide. It is about 60 miles from Newfoundland, and with it forms the entrance of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This island properly belongs to Nova Scotia or Acadia, and is the only part which, in the peace, was ceded to the English, its present possessors. 
It is 96 miles long, and 60 wide, full of mountains and lakes, and its coasts abound in creeks and ports close to each other. The soil is very fertile, and abounds in every part in timber. In its mountains are veins of coal, and on its shores an unexampled quantity of fish. It also produces much flax, and cattle, and birds of every species. All its ports are open to the e. and are found all along the coast to the s. from Port Delfin to Port Tolosa, near to which is the entrance of the Strait of Fronsac. 
[The Harbour of St. Peter's at the w. end of the island, is a very commodious place for carrying on the fishery. This island was considered as annexed to Nova Scotia in respect to matters of government till 1784, when it was erected into a separate government by the name of Sydney. 
There is a great proportion of arable land on this island ; and it abounds in timber and hard wood, such as pine, beach, birch, maple, spruce, and fir. 
Here are about 1000 inhabitants, who have a lieutenantgovernor resident among them, appointed by the king. Isle Madame, which is an appendage to this government, is settled for the most part with French Acadians, about 50 families, whose chief employment is the fishery at Ashmot, the principal harbour in this little island. The principal towns are Louisburg, the capital, and Sydney. Louisburg has the best harbour in the island. The present seat of government is at Spanish River, on the n. side of the island. 
This island may be considered as the key to Canada, and the very valuable fishery in its neighbourhood depends for its protection on the possession of this island ; as no nation can carry it on without some convenient harbour of strength to supply and protect it, and Louisburg is the principal one for these purposes. 
The peltry trade was ever a very inconsiderable object. It consisted only in the skins of a few lynxes, elks, muskrats, wild cats, bears, otters, and foxes, both of a red, silver, and grey colour. Some of these were procured from a colony of Micmac Indians, who had settled on the island with the French, and never could raise more than 60 men able to bear arms. The rest came from St. John's, on the neighbouring con-]  TAB  [tinent. Greater advantages are now derived from the coal mines which are situate near the entrance of the harbour, the working of which, and the fishery, are the chief employment of the inhabitants. They lie in a horizontal direction ; and being no more than six or eight feet below the surface, may be worked without digging deep, or draining off the waters. Notwithstanding the 
{>rodigious demand for this coal from New Engand, from the year 1745 to 1749, these mines would probably have been forsaken, had not the ships which were sent out to the French islands wanted ballast. In one of these mines, a fire has been kindled, which, it is said, could never yet be extinguished. These mines yield a revenue of £12,000 yearly to the crown. 
In 1743, while this island belonged to the French, they caught 1,149,000 quintals of dry fish, and 3,500,000 quintals of mud fish ; the value of both which, including 3116^ tons of train oil, drawn from the blubber, amounted to £926,577 10s. sterling, according to the prime cost of the fish at Newfoundland. The whole value of this  trade, annually, at that period, amounted to 1,000,000 sterling. No less than 564 ships, besides shallops, and 27,000 seamen, were employed in this trade. At present the inhabitants of this island take about 30,000 quintals of fish annually, which are shipped for Spain and the Straits, principally by merchants from Jersey (in England), who yearly resort here, and keep stores of supplies for the fishermen. 
Though some fishermen had long resorted to this island every summer, the French, who took possession of it in August 1713, were properly the first settled inhabitants. They changed its name into that of Isle Royale, and fixed upon Fort Dauphin for their principal settlement. In 1720, the fortifications of Louisburg were begun. The other settlements were at Port Toulouse, Neruka, &c]

It was possessed by the Dutch, who established a colony in it in 1632, by the name of New Walcheren. The French, under Marshal Estrees, dislodged them in 1677 ; but surrendered it up at the treaty of Nimega. It was afterwards abandoned, and the English began to cultivate it, though these were obliged at last to quit it, from the repeated invasions they experienced from the Caribee Indians of Tierra Firme, who dwell at the mouth of the Orinoco ; and from this time, notwithstanding its fine climate, has it remained uncultivated and desert.

It is 180 miles long, and about 60 wide ; and its name is derived from its cazique or lord, who was governing at the time that the Spaniards entered it, commanded by Hernan Cortes, who was engaged in the conquest of Nueva Espana. In 1525, it was conquered and reduced to obedience to the kings of Spain, by Captain Vallecillo. It is of an hot and moist temperature, and the territory is low and plain, but very full of woods ; in which there are abundance of cedars, brazil, and many other sorts of woods. The country is unhealthy from the abundance of rain, and the prevalence of strong winds, which last for nine months together ; but it is very fertile in fruits of the country, such as mameyes, zapotes, aquacates, quaybas, and many others of a delicate taste, as also in European productions. 
It produces much maize, of which there are three or four crops annually ; rice and cocos, which are sent for sale to Vera Cruz ; pulse, garden and many medicinal herbs, tobacco, and, above all, cacao, this being the most abundant production of any, and that which is the greatest source of commerce ; it being also in this that the natives used to pay their tribute to the Emperors of Mexico. It is not less abundant in pepper, which is much esteemed, and of which great quantities are carried to all parts, although of inferior quality to the pepper of the east. The breed of cattle, of all species, has increased greatly in this country ; and in the woods there are leopards, dantas, small boars, rabbits, deer, monkeys, squirrels, tapeyes ; quintes, similar to stags, but smaller ; and very many birds, such as pheasants, parrots, quails, hens, pigeons,  doves, and an infinite number of others, large and small. Although the cottontree be here in abundance, the fruit is made no use of, since it is eaten by the monkeys before it ripens, as also by the squirrels, and other small animals, with which the country is overrun. But all these plagues are less obnoxious than the musquitoes, of different kinds, which will scarce suffer men to exist : for no one can sleep except covered by a canopy, the heat caused by which is intense. 
This province is watered by different rivers, which fertilize it; but the most considerable is that of its name. The capital is the settlement of the same name also, called De Nuestra Senora de la Victoria.

It has been celebrated for its pearlfisheries. 
It had a town near the sea in the n. part, which was destroyed by the pirates in the last (16th) century ; when they infested those seas ; and it was a mile's distance from a road, in which vessels might lie securely, anchoring in 16 to 18 feet water.

It is of a mild temperature, with an inclination to hot; and the territory is agreeable from its cheerfulness, being covered with shady groves and fruittrees of various sorts, and also abounding in medicinal herbs. On the e. part runs from n. to s. a crystalline river, which rises in the top of the sierra, gives a fall of more than 40 yards, and then oozing out from its bed near the settlement, provides a water sufficient to turn a mill, and to irrigate the surrounding country. The population is composed of 159 families of Spaniards, 50 of Mulattoes, and 170 of Indians. It has a convent of the religious of St. Augustin, and in its district are various estates, in which are gathered abundant crops of wheat, maize, and other seeds, and where there are some engines or mills for making certain portions of sugar, of which productions its commerce is composed. 
Half a league from the town is a large lake, which belongs to the House of the Counts of Onate ; from whence are extracted vast quantities of fish ; and at threequarters of a league's   distance is a mountain, close to an estate of the same house, in which there is a deep pool of crystalline water, sweet and limpid, which neither decreases in time of drought, nor swells in the freshes, but is always of one height.

It is also called De Valencia : is 23 miles long from e. to w. and seven wide from n. to s. ; and is so deep as to be at a very small distance from its shore unfathomable. It is formed by the waters of 14 rivers which unite here, after flowing down from the snowy sierra. Its shores are pleasant and beautiful to behold, covered with an immense variety of trees, and thronged with different fowl. It has some islands ; and, amongst the rest, two, which are, each of them, l\ leagues in circumference; abounding in baquiras, paugies, guacharacas, and geese. In this lake grow, upon the surface of the water, very large leaves ; which, entwining with each other by their roots, and harbouring other leaves which fall from the surrounding trees, as well as pieces of earth and timber brought down by the violence of the rivers, form a body of two or three yards thick, and upwards of 30 or 40 yards long, and of such consistency as to have growing upon them large trees ; and these catching the wind, and giving an impetus to the mass thus formed ; the whole is, to all intents, a perfect floating island, which, however, is often doomed to crumble to pieces by continual agitation. 
[New islands appear in this lake from time to time, from the diminution of water (las aparecidas).

==[[Tacuchameta|TACUCHAMETA]]==, a settlement of the missions which were held by the religious of S. Francisco, in the province of Cauliacan and kingdom of Nueva Vizcaya ; between the rivers Elota and Tabala. It produces maize, French beans, and an abundance of wax and honey. 
==[[Tacucu|TACUCU]]==, a small river of the province and government of Guayana or Nueva Andalucia. It enters the Caroni by the w. side, nearly opposite the settlement of La Divina Pastora. 
==[[Tacunga|TACUNGA]]==, a province and corregimiento of the kingdom of Quito, to the s. ; bounded e. by the vailey of Vicioso, n. by the corregimiento of Quito, n.w. by the province and government of Esmeraldas, by the province of Guayaquil; s.w. by that of Chimbo, and s. by that of Ambato. Its length is 21 leagues from e. to w. and its width 14 from n. to s. It is of a very cold temperature, but abounding in cattle which have excellent pastures. It produces wheat, barley, and rye, and wools of many kinds, of which some beautiful articles are manufactured. In the settlement of Pugiili are made various vessels of a red clay, which are carried for sale to Quito and to the other provinces, where they are much esteemed. 
This province is fertilized by many rivers, the principal of which are, that of Alaques and that of San Felipe. It has several medicinal baths, and abounds throughout in nitre, so that it make*  TAC  as good powder as any in Europe. It is well peopled with Indians, and it was, in the times of the gentilism, called by them Llatancunga. 
It was conquered by Sebastian de Belalcazar in 1533, after very little resistance on the part of the natives, although he was much assisted in his enterprise by an irruption of the volcano Cotopaxi, which greatly dismayed them. It enjoys different temperatures, according to the various settlements ; those on the mountains being warm, those of the llanos moderately so, and those close to the mountain deserts very cold. The genius of this people and of its neighbourhood is greater than that of those of the other provinces. 
In the llanura, in which the capital stands, and which abounds in huge crags of rock and stone, which have, at various times, been thrown up by the volcano, are to be seen the walls of one of the palaces which belonged to the Incas ; the entrance to which is by a passage of five or six toises long, and serving as an entrance to the hall. Around the hall are three great saloons, which form the three grand fronts, and in each of these are various divisions ; and at the back of that saloon which is opposite to the entrance are compartments, which, to all appearance, were made for keeping animals in. The materials of which this palace is built, consist chiefly of a hard black stone, which has the semblance of flint. Moreover, these stones are so beautifully knit together that the joining is scarcely visible. In the exterior part of the building the said stones are all worked convex, and at the entrance of the gates they are of a plain superficies ; for, although naturally of an unequal size and of irregular figure, this objection is overruled by the nicety and labour with which they have been knit together. The height of the walls is 2-ftoises, and their thickness from three to four feet. The gates also are five yards high, so as to admit the palanquins of the Incas. At 50 toises from this edifice to the n. is a small mountain, singular as being the only one in the llano. It is from 60 to 70 jards high, of a round figure, like a sugarloaf, and so equal in all its parts as to have the appearance of having been made by hand ; as we are assured was really the case. It was just by the chief gates, and served as a watch tower, commanding a full view of the plain. This mountain was called Panecillo del Callo, by the Spaniards, the same name having been given to, and retained by the aforesaid palace to the present day. 
Tacuba, the capital, is of the same name,  with the dedicatory title of San Vicente Martin ; situate in an extensive llanura to the s. of Quito, near the cordillera of the Andes, from which stands out a very lofty mountain, and at a distance from the skirt of which is the town, which is girt in on the w. by the river of San Felipe, of a tolerably large stream. This river, although it be fordable at times, must, at its swellings, be passed by the bridge. 
The town is large and well arranged, the streets are wide, the houses all of pumicestone (which is so light as to swim upon the water, and which unites well with mortar), arched and handsome, although low, to guard against mischief from earthquakes. It has, besides the parishchurch, a convent of the religious of San Francisco ; another of S. Domingo, another of S. Agustin, another of La Merced ; and it had a college which belonged to the Jesuits, and a monastery of Barefooted Carmelites, which was transferred to Quito, and now exists with the name of Carmen Baxo. 
This town was destroyed in 1698 by an earthquake, when nothing but the aforesaid college and one house out of 600 remained ; the greater part of the inhabitants also perishing. An equal catastrophe was likewise repeated in the years 1743 and 1757, from its being no further than six leagues distance from the volcano of Cotopaxi, and in consequence of which its temperature is very cold. The natives are great mechanics and artisans. The_y make cloth, baizes, and other manufactures called tucuyos, by which they carry on a good trade ; and they also carry bacon and hams for sale to Quito, Riobamba, and Guayaquil ; the same being highly esteemed for the manner in which they are prepared, namely, so as never to become rancid. All the neighbouring fields are sowed with fine clover and clumps of willows, the verdure of which affords a delightful prospect. 
The inhabitants of this town are reputed at 12,000 souls of all sexes and ages ; the greater part being of Spaniards and Mustees, and amongst the former some families of high distinction ; as, for instance, that of the Marquis of Maenza, who has here a magnificent house, and a rich estate, with some manufactories, called La Cienga : [it is 44 miles s. of Quito and 49 miles n. n. e. of Rio Bamba. In s. latitude 55' 14§", and w. longitude 78° 23'.]

It is very fertile, and abounds in Brazilwood, cotton, sugar, cedars, cocos, and many kinds of wood, of the which it maintains a lucrative commerce ; this being facilitated by a very good port which is in the island, and which is entered by a narrow channel. This port is commanded by a fortress which is upon an eminence, and it was taken by the Dutch, who built another fortress at its entrance with the name of Orange ; the same being inaccessible for the swamps with which it was surrounded; whilst vessels seeking to enter the port were exposed to the whole fire from this fort. 
The other mouth of the channel, called Catevamah, has scarcely 10 feet of water, and is fit only for flatbottomed vessels. The island is about three leagues long, one wide, and seven or eight in circumference. 
This captainship and government was founded by Pedro Lopez de Sousa, who having obtained from the king, Juan HI. a grant of 50 leagues of territory as a reward for his services ; took seven leagues only of the coast, and the rest from the interior to the s. This property passed by the female line to the house of the Marquises of    T A M 
Cascaes. It was at first possessed by the infidel Pitiv uares Indians, but who were conquered and subjected. The French took possession of this province, and kept it till 1635. It is watered by a river of the same 'name, and on the shores of which are 22 sugarengines ; and it pays annually to government 30,000 Portuguese ducats. Its population consists of the city of Goayana and the settlements of Tejucupapo, Tacoara, Capibaribi, and Nuestra Seiiora del Destierro, besides the capital, which is situate in the island, and bears the same name, with the dedicatory title of Nuestra Seiiora de la Concepcion. 
The capital is on the top of a mountain, has a magnificent parish church, and two regular garrison companies for its defence. The whole of the territory in its vicinity is covered with cultivated estates, sugar engines, and beautiful country houses, forming a region most pleasant and delightful, and one at the same time abounding in all the necessaries and conveniences of life. The population should amount to 200 housekeepers, [and that of the whole province may amount to" about 2000.

It rises in the country of the Itenes or Ytenese Indians, runs s. s. w. and enters the river Itenes, about 30 miles n. w. of Fort de Principe de Beira. [This magnificent river, which derives its copious sources, flowing through numerous large branches, from the abovementioned captainship, runs n. between the Madeira and the Chingu for 300 leagues, flowing into the Amazonas, in lat. 2° 27' s. and long. 54° 36' w. which is nearly the geographical position of the town of Santarem ; situate about 20 miles e. of its mouth, and 350 w. from the city of Para. In some of the 
?lains in which this river rises, are those called 'arexis, that is from an Indian nation which inhabits them. These plains occupy a vast" space, not level, but formed by undulating heaps of sand and light earth, resembling large waves. The spectator who is in the midst of them ever sees before him a distant and extended mount ; he advances towards it by a gentle and long declivity, traverses the plain, and advances by an ascent equally gentle, until he gains imperceptibly the heights he saw ; another eminence then presents itself, and he proceeds with the same recurring circumstances. The soil of these wide plains is sandy, and so light that loaded beasts in passing sink into it so much as to impede their progress. Thepasturage is poor, consisting of a grass composed of wiry stalks a foot high, and small rough lancetshaped leaves ; the animals in grazing pluck them up with the roots covered with sand; on this account the passage by land is difficult and tedious; though, on finding any of the streams, which abound in these plains, there is grass and other mild herbage, which afford them tolerable pasturage.] 
3 T  TAPOYAES.  
[The plains of Parexis form, to a large extent and breadth, the summit of those high mountains of the same name, and are situate on some of the most elevated land in all Brazil. In these plains and mountains are the origins of many very large rivers, which flow down from them on all sides ; the Paraguay, as well in its own numerous heads, the principal of which are, the Jauru, the Sypotuba, and the Cuiaba ; and the Madeira, which is the largest river that flows into the Amazonas on the s. has some of its sources in these mountains, though its most remote sources are in the mountains to the n. of Potosi in Peru. 
The Tapajos, flowing in a direction contrary to that of the abovenamed river (the Paraguay) rises in these mountains. Its easternmost branch is the river Arinos, which entwines its sources with those of the Cuiaba at a short distance from those of the Paraguay. The river Arinos has a w. branch, called Rio Negro, from which, to the point where it is navigable, there is a passage of eight leagues overland to the river Cuiaba, below its upper and greatest falls ; and, in like manner, from the Arinos itself the passage to the same part of the river Cuiaba is 12 leagues. 
The Arinos is auriferous at its springs, and in 1747 the mines of Santa Isabel were discovered in it, but immediately abandoned, as not answering the expectations created in those fortunate times by the great quantities of gold drawn from the mines of Cuiaba and Matto Grosso. The lands were infested by dangerous tribes of warlike Indians. . 
The river Sumidouro empties itselt on the s. side into the Arinos, and its source being a short distance from that of the Sypotuba, a large w. branch of the Paraguay, there is an easy communication from one river to the other. The famous discoverer, Joao de Souza Echevedo, in 1746 made this passage : he descended the river Cuiaba, and sailing up the Sypotuba to its very sources, he there passed his canoes overland into the Sumidouro, which he navigated, following the current, notwithstanding that the river runs for some distance under ground, and thence derives its appellation. After this, he passed into the Arinos* and thence into the Tapajos, where he surmounted the falls, though more difficult than those of the Madeira, and discovered many symptoms of gold in the river of Tres Barras, a w. arm of the Tapajos, 100 leagues below the springs of the Arinos. West of the Sumidouro, and in the plains of Parexis, the river Xacuru-  tina has its origin to the «. of the river Jauru : it is famous for a lake, situate in one of its branches, where every year is produced a great quantity of salt, which is a constant cause of war among the Indians. Some navigators make the Xacurutina an arm of the Arinos, and others of the Sumidouro. In these plains of Parexis, terminating to the w. in the high mountains so denominated, which, extending 200 leagues in a n. n. w. direction, front the Guapore at a distance of 15 or 20 leagues, springs the river Juruena, between the heads of the Jauru and the Guapore, a league w. of the former and two e. of the latter. This river, the largest and westernmost branch of the Tapajos, rises in lat. 14° 42' s. 20 leagues n. n. e. of Villa Bella, and, running n. 120 leagues, flows into the Arinos, and with it forms the bed of the Tapajos. 
The Juruena receives on both sides many small rivers, those from the w. affording many practicable communications by short passages overland with the Guapore and its confluent streams. The uppermost of these, which is nearest to Villa Bella, is the Securiu, navigable even there, and almost to its source. This is a league n. of the principal source of the river Sarare, which, a quarter of a league from its head, is three yards deep and five broad. Thus sailing up the Juruena into the Securiu, and making from its source the short landpassage of a league to the Sarare, the navigator may reach Villa Bella in less than eight days, without any other obstacle than that of the fall formed by the Sarare, three leagues below its source, where it precipitate* itself from the Parexis mountains on the w. slope : this difficulty may be surmounted in detail, or by at once passing the four leagues, for the Sarare from its fall becomes immediately navigable to the capital of Matto Grosso. A league n. of the source of the Sarare is the first head of the river Galera, the second confluent of the Guapore below Villa Bella; and a league e. of the same head rises the Ema, a w. branch of the Securiu, affording equal facility of communication. The Galera has three other sources n. of the first in the plains of the Parexis, all ample streams; the last and most n. called Sahara, is distant little more than a league from the source of the river Juina, a large w. branch of the Juruena. Thus, by the Juina and the Securiu, with a crossing of five or six leagues, so as to pass the falls of the Galera on the w. scarp of the mountain, the Juruena may be connected with the Guapore. 
Lastly, the Juruena may be navigated to its upper fall, which is within two leagues of its own]  [source. The fall is formed by two small leaps, the river being, even in this part, 30 yards broad and of great depth ; from hence downwards it flows with great rapidity, yet its falls are not greater, and are more passable, than those of the Arinos. With the same circumstances, and by similar short landpassages, a communication is practicable from the Juruena with the rivers Guapore and Jauru, which are to the e. of it, although these two rivers precipitate themselves from the s. side of the Parexis mountains, where they rise, and immediately form numerous and extensive falls. 
From the geographical position of the Tapajos, it is evident that this river facilitates navigation and commerce from the maritime city of Para to the mines of Matto Grosso and Cuiaba, by means of its large branches, the Juruena and Arinos. If the short passages overland should be found troublesome to drag canoes, the goods may be forwarded immediately on mules. This navigation to Matto Grosso is at least 200 leagues shorter than that performed through the Madeira and Guapore ; it is consequently less tedious and expensive, and equally advantageous to the mines of Cuiaba. The navigation of the river Tapajos might lead also to new discoveries in the vast unexplored parts of this river, up to its entrance into the plains of the Parexis, and their products might add to those of the extensive regions on the Amazonas. Besides this, the river is known to be auriferous for a great part of its course : it is known also, that, passing from the Juruena into its w. arm, the river Camarare, and the heads of the river Jamary or Das Candeas, which, running in broad streams down the e. side of the Parexis Mountains, enters the Madeira, there are mines which have inspired great hopes, though but lately seen, after a fruitless search of 20 years. — Mawe's Travels.^

==[[Tapuyes|TAPUYES]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians, and one of the most numerous in Brazil, spread over a great extent of territory towards the w. It is divided into many tribes, cantons or governments, each having its particular king. They are larger and more robust than any of the Brazilians, and, in some respects, also the most barbarous. They are of an obscure colour, have  black, flowing over their    508  shoulders, and shave their faces and all the other parts of their bodies, not even excepting the eyebrows. Their kings, for distinction, have their hair dressed in the shape of a crown, and their finger nails very long. Both sexes go naked, with the exception of a small sash round the waist. The men are accustomed to adorn themselves with feathers fastened to their foreheads with wild wax, being particularly choice in their selection. They weave mantles of cotton after the manner of nets, which are so strongly united with feathers as to keep out the strongest rain. They bore their ears, nostrils, and under lip, paint the body of a dark colour, sticking upon their skins great quantities of feathers with honey. Their sandals are of the bark of a fruit which they call aguay. When the father or mother of any one dies, he testifies his sorrow by cutting off his hair. They have a great relish for human flesh, and, in case of a stillborn, the mother immediately devours her infant. Their principal arms are bows and arrows, and with these they are so dexterous as to kill birds flying. Some of them do not use these weapons, but throw javelins with a certainty almost incredible; whilst others only carry a sort of club of very strong wood, and pointed at one end, which they manage with extreme address. Their martial instrument is a kind of trumpet made of some human bone, or of the horn of some animal. These Indians, besides being the most robust, are the best soldiers in Brazil. They are continually wandering about from place to place, and, for the most part, inhabit the woods. They neither sow or cultivate any thing, maintaining themselves by the natural productions of the soil and by the animals they kill. 
With respect to religion, they are without even that of the other Indians of Brazil, and are given up to a brutish and unbridled libertinism, and are, in consequence, more than any other Indians, enemies to the Europeans. 
The Dutch had extended their conquests through the territory of these Indians, but, since they were driven out from thence by the Portuguese, the Indians have disclaimed all intercourse whatever with Europeans. Notwithstanding this, some have been reduced to the Catholic faith. Their ifliom is the most common in Brazil, but is split into different dialects.

It is watered by the two large rivers Del Norte and of Yaquis, which also serve as its limits. It takes its name from the nation of Indians thus called, which was bounded by the nation of the Tepeguanes, and discovered by Juan de Fonte, of the order of the Jesuits, and a native of Tarraza in Cataluna, in 1614. 
These Indians used to live in very large caves, had for clothes mantles of pita, which they wove with great nicety. In the burying of their dead they differed from other nations ; inasmuch as they had a regular cemetery for this purpose at a distance from their abodes, although, like many others, they deposited with the defunct all his valuables, together with plenty of food for his supposed journey. They also immediately burnt the house in which he used to live. This people were naturally mild and pacific, and were easily reduced to the Catholic faith by the aforesaid Jesuit, although they, some years after, returned to their idolatry. 
The country of this province is mountainous and rugged, but abounding in silvermines, the metal of which was prepared in the real of Santa Eulalia.

==[[Tarija|TARIJA]]==, a district and jurisdiction of the province of Chichas in Peru, and of the archbishopric of Charcas. It is small, but its territory is very fertile in wheat, maize, wine, oil, and other fruits. It contains excellent pastures, in which are maintained much cattle ; nor does it want mines of gold and silver, although these are not worked, for want of hands. It is watered, by different rivers, which abound in fish, which are caught and salted down by the Indians, and carried for sale to Potosi. The river, which they call Tipuanis, and which laves the e. side of the jurisdiction, carries in its sands much gold, which the Indians employ themselves in picking out for the payment of their tribute. Tarija, the capital, is the town of the same name, with the dedicatory of San Bernardo. It was built under the command ot the viceroy Don Francisco de Toledo, to restrain the hostilities committed by the Indians, and for the purpose of defending the high road to Tucuman, in 1591. It has a convent of the religious of St. Domingo, and another of San Francisco ; which belonged to the Observers until 1755, when it came under the charge of apostolic missionaries of the same order; — other two of SanAgustin and San Juan de Dios, and a college which belonged to the Jesuits. 
In the aforesaid convent of San Francisco is venerated a cross, which was found in a cave at the beginning of the conquest, and which, some pretend, was made by one of the apostles, who preached the gospel in that country, although no traces of Christianity were found amongst the Indians at the arrival of the Spaniards. Towards the part bordering on the territory of the Infidels, a fort has been built to restrain their incursions. It is situate on the 5. shore of the river

It has a convent of the religious of San Francisco. 
==[[Tarimbo|TARIMBO]]==, a settlement of the province and alcaldia mayor of Valladolid, and bishopric of Mechoacan. 
==[[Tarma|TARMA]]==, a province and corregimiento of Peru ; bounded n. by the provinces of Huamalies and Guamico, e. by the mountains of the infidel Indians, s. by the province of Xauja, s. w. by that of Guarochiri, w. by that of Canta, and n.w. by that of Caxatambo, and also w. by an angle of the province of Chancay, formed by the territory of Chacras. Its temperature is, generally, cold, and thus nearly all its articles of subsistence are provided from the other provinces. But it produces some maize, and plenty of papas, and has abundance of cattle, of the wool of which they make much cloth of the country, this being its principal branch of trade. It has many mines, which are worked to considerable profit, and particularly so the celebrated mine of Lauricocha, which has upwards of 60 engines wherewith to work it. But this system of labour was much destroyed through the insurrection of the Cunchos Indians, which happened in this province in 1742 ; when they destroyed some settlements ; such as that of Huancabamba, which stood upon the mountain. Since that period it has ceased to yield the fruits which it did formerly, namely, woods, cocoa, fruit, and pulse ; and this, notwithstanding that the whole province had been restored to perfect tranquillity by the fieldmarshal D. Joseph de Llamas, marquis of Men a Hermosa, who was then general at Callao, and chieftain of the armies of Peru ; he having been sent upon the said expedition by the viceroy, the Count de Superunda. He built for the security of this  province many forts, to guard it from the Indians of the mountains. 
This province is watered by various rivers, one of the principal Of which is that of Pari, which rises in it from a lake called Chinchaycocha, which is nine leagues long and three wide. This river runs s. and has been thought by many to be the origin of the Maranon, and indeed it takes this name as running through the whole province of Xauja, and arriving at that of Guanuco, it collects in its course many other rivers, which swell it to an immense size. Another principal river is that which runs through the settlement of Rancas, annexed to the curacy of the settlement of Pasco, which has its rise from the streams of the waterfalls flowing down from the cordillera, and unites itself with another. Towards the n. near the lake called Lauricocha, issues another small river, which passes through the province of Guamalies, running to the n. and which, according to Mr. Samuel Fritx, a wise German missionary, is the true origin of the Maranon. 
This corregimiento had arepartimiento of 200,000 dollars, and its corregidor paid an alcabala of 400 annually, from whence an estimate of its high state of population may be inferred ; a truth borne out by the number of the following settlements, of the which that of its name is the capital, the same being a large and rich town owing to the valuable silver mines in its district, and to its lucrative trade in woollen cloths which it manufactures. [This city is situate on the n. shore of the river Chanchamayo, a branch of the Para, and in its vicinity are some very high mountains ; it is 103 miles e. n. e. of Lima, and  and are :  of Huanuco or Gu  anuco, in lat. 11° 35' s.  long. 75° 17' a>.]  The other settlements  Oroya,  Quiparaira,  Acobamba,  Ninacaca,  Palcamayo,  Huachon,  Picoy,  Pasco,  Tapu,  Vico,  Sto.

The new colonists, being convinced of the fertility and beauty of the valley of Cupira, began to sow cacao, and, in a short time, there came to establish themselves here many Spaniards from San Sebastian de los Reyes, and from other settlements ; so that the city was increasing in population when the Tomuzas Indians returned, for the second time, to the attack ; but were utterly routed through the valour of the inhabitants, who hung up nine of them whom they had taken prisoners: the same lot also awaited the assailants, together with the loss of a general, when the city was threatened by the Dutch. It has a very good church, dependent upon the bishopric of Puerto Rico ; the bishop of which, Don Juan   Lopez Agurto de la Mata, placed in it the most holy sacrament.

==[[Tasco|TASCO]]==, a province and alcaldia mayor of Nueva Espana. It abounds in silver mines, in which consists its chief commerce.

Acamistlahuac, Cozcatlan, 
Tasco el Viejo, Coatlan, 
Tlamahuazapa, Pilcaya, 
Talistac, Noxtepec. 
Tasco, the capital, is the real of mines of its name ; enjoys a mild temperature, and is inhabited by a number of people employed in working the mines, which is a labour of very long standing, although they do not produce now so much as they used ; since, as the deeper they are dug, the more troublesome is the water, and  T A V  to extract this is a work of great cost and infinite trouble. The regular population amounts to 200 families of Spaniards, Mustees, and Mulattoes, and 120 of Indians, includingthose of some wards of its vicinity. It has a very good parish church. [This was constructed and endowed towards the middle of the 18th century by Joseph de Laborde, a Frenchman, who gained immense wealth in a short time by the Mexican mines. The building of this church alone cost this individual more than two millions of francs, or £.83,340 sterling. Towards the end of his career, being reduced to great poverty, he obtained from the archbishop of Mexico permission to sell for his benefit, to the metropolitan church of the capital, the magnificent custodia set with diamonds, which, in better times, he had offered through devotion to the tabernacle of the parish church of Tasco. The elevation of this city is 783 metres, or 2567 feet. It is 60 miles s. by w. of Mexico, on the n. shore of the river Zacatula ; in lat. 18° 33' n. and long. 99° 31' a>.]

It has many goldmines, which have often induced the Spaniards to settle here ; although their attempts have been rendered invalid through the barbarity and ferocity of the natives. It is of an extremely hot, though variable temVOL, IV.  perature : on the e. it is washed by the river Atrato, by which the Indians have a trade with the English of Caledonia, receiving in exchange for gold cacao and campeche wood, knives, muskets, powder, and other articles.

==[[Taumaco|TAUMACO]]==, an island of the country of Espiritu Santo in the s. part of America; thus called as having been discovered by Fernando de Quiros in 1606, near 1250 leagues from Mexico. Here the commander entered into a treaty with the lord of the island ; who was corpulent, of a pale colour, with black eyes, the nose somewhat flat, the beard and hair white, and countenance serious. Here Quiros took in water, and asked the chief if there were any other islands near to them ; upon which upwards of 60 were named by the chief, who also spoke of a great country called Manicola. These islands are situate from the *. a quarter to s. w. to n. e. The chief also indicated by signs, that it was a ten week's voyage to the said country ; that there were there people of all colours, friends and enemies; and that some were Caribes, which he gave to be understood by seizing the flesh of his arm between his teeth. The other informations obtained by Quiros in the bay accorded with these ; but he was, in addition, told, that he would meet with cows, buffaloes, birds, and a great quantity of pearls. On his departure he took with him four of these Indians, three of whom were drowned in swimming back to the shore, and the third arrived at Mexico, where, having iearned Spanish, he completely verified all that Quiros had learned. This Indian was a native of the island Chichayano, which is larger than that of Taumaco, being SOO miles distant from the same. He said that his country was very level, and more abounding in fruits ; that the natives wore their hair much longer, and that some of them had it red, and were very fair ; whilst others were of a Mulatto colour, and some with curly hair like a Negro ; that they used to find various sorts of pearl oysters, especially where the water was shallow, and that there were many other islands which he named, such as Guatopo, 150 miles from Taumaco ; Tucopia, 100, where was the country of  
Manicola; and that in Taumaco there was a pilot, who had been in many others. 
He also mentioned an island called Pauro, from whence were brought many curiosities, and amongst the rest arrows with coloured points. Quiros took notice, in the days of Philip and James, of many black stones of great weight; some of which he carried to Mexico, and which proved to be silver. Again, the Indian, Pedro, asserted, that in Taumaco there was abundance of these stones, and spoke much of the great population of all the above islands, as well as of other countries to the s. e. and w. Indeed, all that he said coincided with the conjectures of the most intelligent persons, and with the experience of several latter discoverers; although there are not wanting some to doubt of the truth of these relations ; as, for instance, the Exjesuit Coleti, who, however, does not give any proof against what has been written by, and appears in the diary of, Fernando de Quiros. 

[==[[Taunton|TAUNTON]]==, a river which empties into Narraganset Bay, at Tiverton, opposite the n. end of Rhode Island : it is formed by several streams which rise in Plymouth County, Massachusetts.

==[[Tayronas|TAYRONAS]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, in the province and government of Santa Marta. It is one of the most numerous nations, and acknowledged to be superior, by all the others, as well for its valour, as because it was the only nation which had a metal foundry, there being a great quantity of gold in the valley of its name : and it was on this account that its conquest was undertaken by captain Pedro de Ursua in 1552 • but who, in spite of all his endeavours, was forced to return to Santa Marta with his army, worn out with fatigue from the valorous resistance it had made when attacked by the Taironas, in the most dangerous of all the passes of Origuo (this name having been corrupted into Rodrigo), and where, with only 12 Spaniards, the bold Ursua made front against 1000 enemies, although he at last, with his brave comrades, died of hunger. This valorous nation, which has never bowed its neck to the Spanish yoke, has now been for several years extinct, or has been mixed and incorporated with other nations, according to the opinion of the Exjesuit, Don Antonio Julian, in his History of Santa Marta, in contradistinction to the opinion of the Senor Piedrahita, who will have it they are totally destroyed. It is equally a doubt what extent of territory was held by the Taironas, though, with respect to the valley which induced the Spaniards to undertake the conquest of the country, the aforesaid Senor Piedrahita asserts, that it is upon the shore of the river Don Diego. The capital was the town of Posigueica.

It produces wheat, maize, French beans, barley, large vetches, and other seeds. The natives breed neat cattle and goats, are laborious, and fabricate mantles of cotton and other woven stuffs, by which consists their commerce. They also make mats of reeds of palm, and small baskets, providing with the same nearly the whole of the kingdom ; since, although they be made in other parts, these have always the preference. Here is also a marble quarry, in which are found many veins of a green and white colour, of which several curiosities are made; viz. altars, and skylights as clear as though they were of glass. This jurisdiction is divided into two divisions, to the which 16 settlements are subject, five in the n. and two in the s. part, and in these are counted 1346 families ; and in the midst of these settlements is the capital.

It is united to the alcaldia of Teozacualco, notwithstanding there are found lying between, both those of Penoles, Cinatlan, and part of that of Oaxaca. It has no other production or trade, save in that of cochineal ■ for, although the soil is fertile, and capable of yielding whatever is sown, the natives despise agriculture, studying the cultivation of nopalares, as being more advantageous, and, consequently, sowing no more maize than what is required for their own consumption.

Its population consists of 320 families of Zapotecos Indians, and 20 of Mustees and Mulattoes, the latter of whom are employed in the ranchos of the district, and the former in the cultivation of cochineal.

It comprehends nine principal settlements or head settlements of the district; has abundant salines, and by these makes a great trade, as well as by the fruits and seeds which it produces, and the fish caught in its rivers. 
Tehuacan, the capital, which is of the same name, is. of a beautiful plant, of a mild and pleasant temperature, and delightfully situate in the high road leading to Oaxaca and to Guatemala ; and is, thus, a place of considerable trade. The waters, which irrigate and fertilize its territory, are sweet and well tasted, but are full of nitrous particles, and, consequently, coagulate, and petrify the earth in the pipes and aqueducts through which they pass ; depositing on them, as it were, a coat of stone and mortar, so that it is necessary frequently to change the pipes for the free passage of the water ; and thus it is common to see laying about the fields parts of this incrustated matter, which has the appearance of the ruins of some old buildings. This same nitre, of this petrifying quality in water, acts as a dissolvent on the stone and gravel in the bladder. 
This city has four principal temples, which are the parishchurch and the three convents of San Francisco. It has, besides these, the convent of the Barefooted Carmelites, and that of San Juan de Dios, with a good hospital. The streets, houses, and squares, are modern and handsome, so that it is one of the best cities in the king-  TEH  do in. It carries on a great trade in flour from the quantity of wheat grown in its district (there being in the valley of San Pablo alone 22 estates), and with this article supplies the market of Vera Cruz and the neighbouring provinces as far as the Havana and Campeche. This city is inhabited by very many families of Spaniards, Mustees, and Mulattoes, and more than 2080 of Indians, not to mention 300 or more residing in the country estates. [It was, according to Humboldt, one of the most frequented sanctuaries of the Mexicans before the arrival of the Spaniards. One hundred and eighteen miles s. e. of Mexico.

It is situate at the foot of the sierra Madre, is of a mild temperature, and fertilized by the said river. The commerce of its inhabitants is in the making of rigging and thread, and in wax seeds and some fruits. In the s. part extends to the S. Sea a large tract entirely desert, rugged, and uninhabited. The way leading from hence to Tecpan, of the jurisdiction of Zacatela, is very dangerous, and what is worse, there is no choice to be made. The population consists of 50 families of Indians.

[==[[Tejuco|TEJUCO]]==, the capital of the diamond district of this name, in Brazil. It is situate in the midst of sterility, and a great portion of its inhabitants, in number about 6000, bear the usual marks of penury and wretchedness ; yet the place is considered in a flourishing state, and the shops are well stocked with English cloth, baizes, hams, cheese, butter, and porter, all brought on mules from Bahia, or Rio de Janeiro ; from the first of which it is distant, in a straight line, about 500 English miles s. by w. and 400 n. of the latter : in lat. 18° IV s. and long. 42° SO' w. according to Arrowsmith's map, but probably twice the distance by the zigzag route of the mountains. Mr. Mawe's account of the above district is very full and interesting. We are indebted to his work for the following information. It consists of rugged mountains, that have a n. and s. direction, and are generally allowed to be the highest in Brazil. What is termed the Diamond Ground, of which (as we have just observed) Tejuco is the capital, extends about 16 leagues from n. to s. and about eight from e. to w. It was first explored by some enterprising miners from Villa do Principe, a few years after the establishment of that town. These men proceeding n. found an open country watered by many small rivulets, which they tried for gold by washing : some of them engaged their attention for a short time, but not proving sufficiently rich, they continued their route, passing the places now called San Gonzales and Melho Verde, until they arrived at a few streams that flow from the base of the mountain on which Tejuco is built. These rivulets were then washed for gold, and were considered as belonging to the district of Villa do Principe. No idea was first entertained that the rivulets contained diamonds, although it is said that some were collected and presented to the then governor of Villa do Principe as curious bright stones, and were used by him as counters at cards. Soon afterwards a few of them found their way to Lisbon, and were given as pretty pebbles to the Dutch minister to send to Holland, which was then the principal mart in Europe for precious stones.

VOL. IV.    were presented for examination, pronounced these pebbles to be very fine diamonds. Information was accordingly sent to the Dutch consul at Lisbon, who did not fail to profit by the occasion ; for he managed the affair with government so well, that he contracted for the precious stones at the same time that he communicated the intelligence. Government afterwards endeavoured to monopolize the diamonds, and made a distinct district of Cerro do Frio, placing it under peculiar laws and regulations. 
The number of diamonds sent over during the first twenty years after the discovery is said to be almost incredible, and to exceed one thousand ounces in weight. This supply could not fail to diminish the general value of diamonds, as none had ever before been known to come from any other part of the globe, except India, whither the Brazilian diamonds were afterwards sent, and found a better market there than in Europe. 
By stratagems and intrigues government was prevailed on to let these invaluable territories to a company, who were under stipulations to work with a limited number of Negroes, or to pay a certain sum per day for every Negro employed. This opened a door to every species of fraud ; double the stipulated number of Negroes were admitted; and this imposition was connived at by the agents of government, who received pay in one hand and bribes in the other. Presents were made to men possessing influence at court, by the contractors, who soon became rich, and they continued (subject to a few regulations) in possession of the diamond mines until about the year 1772, when, government determining to take them into their own hands, these contracts were ended. 
This was the time for reforming abuses, and for placing this rich district under the best regulations, but it was neglected; prejudice prevailed over prudence ; and the management was entrusted to men who did not understand the real interests of the concern, or, what is more probable, who were so shackled in their authority, that they could not pursue them. From this time affairs became worse, and the establishment was in debt to foreigners, who had advanced a considerable sum of money on the security of having all the diamonds which the mines produced. This debt still remains unpaid, and there are other incumbrances which can be removed only by a total change of system. In its present state the establishment appears to produce much greater wealth than it actually does. During a period of five years, from 1801 to] 3x  T E J U C O.    
[1896 inclusive, the expenses were £.204,000 ; and the diamonds sent to the treasury at Rio de Janeiro weighed 115,675 carats. The value of gold found in the same period amounted to £17,300 sterling; from which it appears, that the diamonds actually cost government 33s. 9d. per carat. These years were esteemed singularly productive ; the mines do not in general yield to government more than 20,000 carats annually. Exclusive of this amount there is a vast quantity smuggled. 
The town is under the absolute government of the intendant. The principal officers of the civil and military establishments are, an ouvidor or fiscal, a captain of cavalry, and a captain mor. In the Diamond establishment there is a great number of officers, of whom the following are the principal: 1st. The intendant, who is a judge, and the intendantgeneral of the district of Minas Geraes (this office is one of the best in the gift of the crown) : 2d. The treasurer, whose situation is almost a sinecure : he receives 8000 crusades per annum; and 3d. The administratorgeneral, who has a salary of 6000. The bookkeeper has 4000, and there are three clerks, or keykeepers, who have from 800 to 1000 each. These officers are employed in whatever relates to the treasury, or to the general concerns of the establishment ; they all reside in Tejuco, and are the most respectable of the inhabitants. The management of the different works is entrusted to eight or 10 underadministrators, each having in his care 200 Negroes, called a troop, to which, besides a clergyman and a surgeon, are attached several overseers and subordinate officers, who have salaries of from 400 to 200 crusades. The privilege of employing a certain number of Negroes in the works is common to all the officers, to an extent corresponding with their rank : the superior officers let to hire as many as they please, say 40, and sometimes upwards of 50 ; the inferior officers are permitted to let out two or three, in preference to other individuals ; a decidedly bad practice, as will be shown hereafter. 
The intendant holds a place of great trust : he is the superior magistrate, and his duty is to administer justice, and to see that the laws peculiar to the district are duly executed. He is of course president of the assembly, or junta, and calls meetings whenever he thinks proper ; he disposes of the military force of the district, orders roads to be made or stopped, and stations guards on them to examine travellers, and to detain suspicious persons. He has also the privilege of  giving or refusing permission for persons to enter the district, or settle in it ; and every one, however high in rank or property, who passes thither, is supposed to have the intendant s express concurrence, which, as a matter of form, is sometimes dispensed with. He appoints officers, signs all papers, receives all reports that are made, and acts accordingly. To him solely the treasure is entrusted for the payment of the salaries of the officers, the Negroes' wages, tradesmen's bills, and every incidental expense attending the establishment. He issues papermoney, and withdraws it from circulation whenever he thinks proper ; for all which he is responsible to government alone, and may be said to be almost absolute in his office. In addition to these important functions, the intendant has lately assumed the whole direction and regulation of the mining concern, which none of his predecessors ever practically interfered with, it being the peculiar province of the administratorgeneral. 
The administratorgeneral, to whom belong the direction and management of the works, ought to be equally experienced in mining and mechanics, particularly in hydraulics : he should be a man of general information, combined with great practical knowledge relative to the locality of the district, so as to be able to ascertain the real value of every situation, and to direct the operations accordingly. He should have a mind fertile in resources, and prepared to meet every disappointment or casualty that can possibly occur, that the time of the Negroes may not be employed in vain ; he should also facilitate their labours by the introduction of machinery, and should be particularly attentive to their good treatment, since on them his success, and consequently his reputation, must in a great measure depend. 
On this latter point humanity and policy ought alike to direct the attention of the superiors of the establishment. It is natural to suppose that Negroes, when treated with harshness, ill fed and ill clothed, will be indifferent to the interests of their employers, and, perhaps, determined not to find diamonds, whereas, when subjected to milder and kinder usage, which might be done without relaxing in vigilance, they would become anxious to please, and would search more diligently in order to obtain notice and reward. It must be obvious, that Negroes rarely conceal diamonds for themselves ; and yet custom has rendered the feelings of their real owners in Tejuco so irritable, on being suspected to encourage the practice, that if the word grimpera]   U C O.  f(smuggler) is mentioned in conversation, they shudder with horror, and distort their features, calling on the Virgin to witness their abhorrence of a crime to which government has attached the greatest disgraces and punishments. But, notwithstanding all this show of honesty, diamonds are bartered for every thing, and are actually much more current than specie. 
In Tejuco there are about nine or ten principal shopkeepers, to whom the establishment itself, and the officers belonging to it, are frequently indebted ; indeed, these men receive the greater part of the money due to the various persons employed in the works, in exchange chiefly for English commodities of one description or other. The establishment is paid once a year, and for this purpose a sum not less than 300,000 crusades is sent from Villa Rica, to which may be added 60,000 or 100,000 more, found in the gold mines of the district. The greater part of this money flowing into the hands of the shopkeepers, as above stated, is immediately employed in a way injurious to the interests of government ; nor can worse policy be imagined, than that of allowing so large an expenditure in a place which offers such temptations. 
Some years ago many goldmines were washed in this district; but as information was given that diamonds were found in them, they were ordered to be abandoned. At present more equitable measures are adopted, and the proprietors are commencing to work some of them again, under an agreement to give up what diamonds they find. 
There is a general order to work all the goldmines which were formerly confiscated, and this measure will, it is hoped, increase the quantity of ^old, and have a good effect in every respect. 
If* government are obliged to hire Negroes wherever they can obtain them, (which appears to be the case,) it would be at least expedient to have a store to supply them, in order that the money paid in wages to them might return into the funds of the establishment. 
The hiring of Negroes to the diamondworks is the favourite occupation of all ranks in Tejuco ; rich and poor endeavour to engage in it to as great an extent as their property will allow. The pay of the slaves is trifling compared with the risk, their labour being heavy, their maintenance poor, and their treatment harsh; there must, therefore, be some temptation not openly seen, yet as well known as light from darkness. Numbers of persons are thus induced  to reside in Tejuco under various pretexts, but with no other real view than to get their Negroes into the service, and to live idly on their wages, and on what they conceal or pick up. Thus all fatten upon the pasture, except those in the extreme of indigence, and others who, from neglect of economy, are always poor. There are a numerous class, from the age of seven years to upwards of twenty, who are without any visible means of earning their subsistence, and would remain idle even if manufactories were established ; for though they are brought up from their infancy with Negrochildren, yet in the working department they would abandon their former playfellows. The people in general are rendered more averse from habits of regular industry, by the continual hopes which they indulge of becoming opulent by some fortunate discovery of mines ; these fallacious ideas, which they instil into the minds of their children, strongly prejudice them against labour, though they all exist miserably, and not unfrequently depend upon donations. Their education is extremely limited : they are in general total strangers to the sciences, and are very scantily informed on any useful subject. 
The great demand for the precious stones, and the facility of secreting them, have caused them to be searched for and carried away in violation of the existing laws of the country. Of the numbers who have engaged in this illict traffic, from an eager desire to become rich at once, many have eluded the vigilance of the guards, and have finished their career with credit and opulence ; others, less fortunate, have been detected, and have incurred the punishment annexed to the offence, namely, the surrender of their illegally acquired treasure, the confiscation of their whole property, and exile to Africa, or confinement, perhaps for life, in a loathsome prison. This policy may, doubtlessly, be considered too severe ; for, if we should inquire who were the discoverers of perhaps all the diamondmines which have enriched the caskets of the royal family of Portugal beyond comparison with those of any other state, and which have not only augmented the revenues of the government, but have proved the source from which many respectable and enterprising individuals have derived their opulence, we should find that they were adventurers, who, at great risk, and with indefatigable toil, had penetrated unknown forests, and explored deep ravines among the haunts of the savage Anthropophagi, in search of goldmines, and who have by chance found in them] 3x2  TEJUCO.  
[diamonds. When a place of this description has been once discovered by these men, it seldom remains long secret ; the agents of government take possession of it, and either work it immediately, or guard it until a future occasion. The discoverer of course flies from the place ; and if he have picked up a few stones, or robbed the earth of some of its more brilliant rarities, he will seek the best and safest means of procuring value for them. If he be a man of sufficient property, he will hire a few mules, load them with cotton, bacon, and other commodities, and proceed to Rio de Janeiro in regular form. On his arrival there, he enters some good house in which he has confidence, and disposes of his concealed treasure. His mind is then relieved from apprehension, and he begins to make preparations for his return. His first care is to lay out his money to the best advantage : Negroes are his chief object, and these pay a duty to the state on their leaving Angola, and another of 10 milreis each on entering the mining country. If they be employed in mining, government obtains a fifth of the gold found ; and if in agriculture, a tenth of the produce is exacted. The next object of the adventurer is to lay in a stock of woollens, and other English manufactures, which pay a duty of 15 per cent, on being landed, and are subject to another, according to their weight, on entering the territory of the mines. Thus it really appears that most of the contraband property is divided between the state and the smuggler : but this is not all ; the diamonds are sent out of the country, and real effects of value are received in return, leaving a balance much in favour of Brazil. 
This illicit trade has been carried on to a very considerable extent : there is strong presumptive authority for stating that, since the first discovery of the mines, diamonds to the amount of two millions sterling have thus found their way to Europe, exclusive of what the contractors accounted for. This has been owing to the ill management of the whole establishment, and to the total want of necessary regulations, which have prevailed so long, that it will not be easy to apply a remedy. Let us suppose for a moment the system to be changed; the 2000 Negroes employed in the establishment to be the property of the crown (whom two years' profit of the diamond mines would be adequate to purchase) ; these Negroes to be supplied with every article for their support from a general store, and to be treated as mildly as possible: they would then form a society, and, knowing no other mas-  ters than their officers, would have only one common interest to serve. The contraband trade, by this means, though perhaps not totally destroyed, would receive an irrecoverable blow, and would be reduced almost to nothing. Should such a change take place, the shopkeepers, and those persons who subsist by hiring Negroes to the works, would find the source of their emoluments dried up, and, rather than remain at Tejuco, would migrate to situations more congenial to their interests : thus the district would be freed from that bane which has so long overrun it, and government would reap the advantage of having the mines worked by their own Negroes, whom it would be difficult for others to seduce. 
Another evil which such a change of system would be calculated to remove, is the following : — Every article of sustenance required for the establishment is purchased of farmers who reside a few leagues from Tejuco, or who have farms at a greater distance ; and this absurd practice is the cause of much unnecessary intercourse. There are thousands of acres of excellent land in the vicinity of the diamond works, having choice of situation, and fit for the growth of every species of produce. How well might a part of the military force of the place be occasionally spared for a few days only, to be employed in the first operations of husbandry, which would be, to enelose a sufficient quantity of ground in various parts, for the maintenance of the establishment. A certain number of Negroes would be allotted, in proportion to the land under cultivation, and on particular occasions, as in harvest, an auxiliary force would be always at hand. This would be farming with double advantage ; the plough would work instead of the hoe ; aftercrops would be sown to be eaten off the ground, which would thus be enriched and kept in good condition. Numbers of acres would be planted with artificial grass, subject to irrigation where that was practicable, and thus, contrary to the general practice, the cattle would be provided with subsistence in the dry season. Indian corn, wheat, mandioca, feijones, potatoes, &c. would be cultivated, and, under proper management, would yield crops equal to the most sanguine expectation. Storehouses, with requisite conveniences, would soon be erected, in which the grain might be kept without spoiling. Thus would the first principles of husbandry be introduced into the district, and prove a source of more lasting benefit to the state than mines either of gold or dia-]  

TEJUCO.  [monds ; for when the latter were exhausted, there would remain an active and industrious population. It seems, indeed, to have been the purpose of nature, in distributingthese precious substances in these, remote and almost unknown parts, to allure civilized men to settle upon them. 
From the circumstances which have been already explained, it will appear that, under the present system, the government pay for all the diamonds that are found here, and probably receive little more than onehalf; therefore it is evident, that those conveyed through other channels can be sold to the public at a lower price than that at which the former are obtained. But the embarrassed state of the establishment is such, that the managers cannot lessen their expenses, beingobliged to take credit for every article, and to hire almost any Negroes that are offered. These evils have taken too deep root to be eradicated, even by the abilities of the present intendant : had such a man been placed here 40 years ago, empowered to act without controul, and to govern the district as private property, on the principles above stated, he might have rendered it rich and independent. 
As all the diamonds found in these works belong to the crown, the royal family have been accustomed to select from the quantity annually remitted whatever stones they considered worthy their notice, which were generally those exceeding 17 carats. They were formerly sent to Holland to be cut, the Dutch being the contractors of the diamonds from the first discovery of the mines ; but since the emigration of the court to Rio de Janeiro, that trade has been transferred to England, where these precious stones annually arrive, and are sold by private contract. 
The collection of diamonds now in the possession of the Prince Regent is unequalled in number, size, and quality, by that of any potentate in the world ; and is supposed to exceed in value three millions sterling. 
The district of Tejuco has a direct communication with Bahia, and a few troops of mules are continually employed in going from one place to the other. The journey is much longer than to Rio de Janeiro, but the country is less mountainous ; there are fewer ranchos or hovels on the road, and in two parts it is requisite to cany fresh water for two days' consumption. The commodities sent from Tejuco and Minas Novas are very trivial, consisting of topazes, amethysts, and other stones ; in return for which  are brought English finemanufactured goods, particularly hats, printed cottons, stockings, and saddles, which have been much cheaper in Bahia than in England. Coarser articles are generally sent from Rio de Janeiro, the distance being, as before observed, much shorter. 
Of navigable rivers we can say but little. The many small streams that rise in various parts join and form the Jigitonhonda, which may be navigated to sea, without any impediment, in at most ten days' time. How much would the country be benefited if a port were established at the entrance of this river, and vessels were allowed to load and unload ; canoes would find their way from thence into the interior in the short space of 20 days, loaded with every article necessary for the consumption of the district. How superior would this mode of conveyance be to that of making roads through impervious woods, and over almost impassable mountains. How many thousands of crusades, annually expended on mules, would be thus saved to the public ; and what numbers of men would thus be trained for the service of the marine, instead of those now employed as muleteers. With the advantage of such a communication, Minas Novas and Cerro do Frio would more than double their population, and it might be anticipated, that the banks of these fine rivers, now lying deserted and useless, would bloom with every variety of vegetation which this genial climate is capable of producing. 
Under the present system Tejuco ought to maintain itself, and have the least possible intercourse with other places : its commerce ought to be confined wholly to gold and precious stones ; but should government determine to make diamonds a free trade, then a contrary policy would be requisite. 
The quadrupeds of this district are common to other parts of Brazil : mules are the principal beasts of burden, and are much dearer than in the districts more to the s. ; horses are not so numerous, but cheaper, being in very little request, and used only on journeys of pleasure. Horned cattle are bred at a considerable distance, and brought for the consumption of the place. Sheep are almost unknown ; hogs and goats are more plentiful ; of dogs there are but few, and the race is very indifferent. Ounces are very seldom seen ; there are not many deer ; the danta, or tapir, is not uncommon. 
Of birds there are a few varieties, but in no great numbers : partridges are rather common : many are found in the neighbourhood of the mines,,]  
<*2T*    526    and they prove good eating. Domestic fowls are in tolerable plenty, but by no means cheap, being eighteenpence to two shillings each. 
Of serpents, the greater part are harmless ; but the rattlesnake and the jararaca, both equally venomous, are common in this district. Lizards are very numerous, and the cayman, or alligator, is found in most of the rivers. 
Fish are extremely scarce in all the streams, owing to the quantity of matter with which their waters are impregnated from the numerous washings. 
This district is in general free from that troublesome plague, the mosquito, as that insect is peculiar to low and swampy places, and does not bite with such disagreeable effect in elevated and airy situations. Bees are but little attended to, and are scarcely known ; were the management of them better understood and practised by the inhabitants, they might be much increased, and wax might even be exported. 
In closing our observations on this district, we shall add some particulars relative to the capital. The families appear to. live in great sociability ; they frequently form teaparties. The dress of the ladies consists almost entirely of articles of English manufacture, cotton prints, straw hats, artificial flowers, jewelry, &c. Owing to the great distance of Tejuco from a seaport, pianofortes have not been introduced here, or they would probably be in great demand ; for the ladies in general have a taste for music, and touch the guitar with great spirit and elegance. Dancing is a favourite amusement, and all appear much pleased and animated with the English countrydance. The ladies seldom go abroad, except to mass, and then they are usually carried in a chair hung with curtains and a canopy, and suspended from a pole borne by two men. The sedentary habits of the females has been thought injurious to their health ; but, since English saddles have been introduced, they begin to take airings on horseback. 
Warm baths are very generally used, being considered of great efficacy in removing recent colds, to which all persons here are liable, on account of the peculiar nature of the climate. They are invariably offered at night to travellers, as a means of relieving the pains occasioned by the fatigues of the day.]

TEN, a small settlement of the province and government of San Juan de los Llanos, in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada ; annexed to the curacy of the settlement of Tamara, on a spacious and charming plain on the shore of the river Ariporo, which was formerly called Guazeco. It is of a hot temperature, and produces wheat, maize, plantains, &c. and the Indians who dwell here are very few. 

==[[Tena|TENA]]==, Santa Rosa de, a settlement of the head settlement and jurisdiction of Tocaima in the government of Mariquita, of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada. It is of a very hot tern-  perature, and thus produces maize, plantains. yucas, and much sugarcane. Its inhabitants may amount to 800, and they have a tradition, that in their mountains the Indians hid immense treasures upon the entrance of the Spaniards ; but these could never be discovered in spite of every diligence in the search. Eight leagues from Santa Fe. Ten a, another settlement, with the dedicatory title of S. Juan, in the province and government of Quixos and Macas, of the kingdom of Quito. It is reduced, and its situation is between two rivers, which make it fertile in yucas, maize, and plantains. It has an asiento of gold mines, from which a certain quantity of this metal is extracted by the natives. There is also much fish in the rivers.

==[[Tenanfia|TENANFIA]]==, San Francisco de, a settlement of the head settlement of the district of Tlalixcoya, and alcaldia mayor of Mizantla in Nueva Espana ; containing 44 families of Indians. 
==[[Tenango|TENANGO]]==, a jurisdiction and alcaldia mayor of Nu^va Espana, with the surname Del Valle. Its district is limited, although there have been added to it three settlements of the jurisdiction of Tacuba. In the time of the arrival of the ships from the Philippines the roads which pass from the provinces of Zelaya, Guanajuato, and others, from being less rugged, are more crowded than is the high road leading to Mexico ; and thus the caravans of the merchants pass to the right of the capital, without touching at it, especially in the rainy season, when the way is impassable. This road runs through the jurisdictions of Metepec, Marinalco, Temascaltepec, and Zultepec; and the inhabitants are regularly given to the employment of muleteers, though the greater part are miners, who labour in the real De Zaqualpa, abounding in silvermines, which produce tolerably good profit. But, not-  withstanding these employments, agriculture is not forgotten ; for the earth produces fine crops of wheat, maize, and other seeds ; and here are also some engines or mills in which they make sugar, honey, and loafsug'ar, which they carry for sale to the different provinces. Tenango, the capital, is the settlement of the same name ; called also Teutelmango, and situate on the s. confines of the great valley of Ixtlahuaca, Toluca, and Metepec. It contains 188 families of Indians, and 25 of Spaniards and Mustees ; all given to the cultivation of the seeds peculiar to the cold climate, such as wheat, barley, maize, beans, and vetches : 14 or 16 leagues s. w. of Mexico. [It is now a very small settlement, if at all in existence.] The other settlements of this jurisdiction are,

==[[Tenanzinco|TENANZINCO]]==, a settlement of the head settlement of the district of Zoquizingo, and alcaldia mayor of Marinalco in Nueva Espana. It is of a cold and moist temperature, produces many seeds, fruit, woods, large and small cattle, and swine ; contains 608 families of Indians, including those of four wards in its vicinity, 134 of Spaniards, and 53 of Mustees and Mulattoes. In its district is a large estate called La Teneria, through the midst of which passes a large river, whose copious waters irrigate the adjoining lands wherein are gathered large crops of wheat, maize, barley, and other seeds. This settlement is surrounded by seven other estates,- inhabited by about 50 families of Spaniards and Mustees. Two leagues w. of its capital. 
==[[Tenayuca|TENAYUCA]]==, a settlement of the province and alcaldia mayor of Tacuba in Nueva Espana; formerly one of the finest towns in the kingdom, and the capital of the empire of the Chichimecos, and where the Emperor Xiloc held his court and palace ; and at that time the lake came close up to it. After the conquest by the Spaniards it was one of the alcaldias mayores most esteemed for its advantages ; but time has reduced it to a miserable village. It is situate on the skirt of a mountain, which is a stone quarry, from whence they extract large slabs for paving the places, which they call tenayucas, and from whence this settlement takes its name. It contains 160 families, and is three leagues n. n. w. of Mexico.

It was a large and commercial town formerly ; but now reduced to a miserable village, inhabited only by people of colour. It is of a very hot and moist temperature. It had for its curate, for some time, San Luis Beltram, and in the vicinity of its parishchurch is preserved the chasuble with which they used to say mass. [It is 97 miles s. with a slight inclination to the w. of Santa Marta, in lat. 9° 45' n. and long. 74° 33' ©.]

==[[Tenextitlan|TENEXTITLAN]]==, a small settlement of the alcaldia mayor of Guachinango in Nueva Espana; annexed to the curacy of the settlement of Naupan. 
==[[Tenextlatiloyan|TENEXTLATILOYAN]]==, San Miguel de, a head settlement of the district of the alcaldia mayor of San Juan de los Llanos in Nueva Espana. From this spot begins the fertility of the mountains, and the waters here are so abundant that the whole serrania appears a garden covered  with fruit trees, particularly with apples. This cordillera extends as far as Zacatlan. Throughout the whole of this country there are great indications of many mines, and these are corroborated from there having been found in 1725, in the river Teitic, at the foot of a mountain called Tolozin, some detached pieces of stone inlaid with veins of silver of two or three marks of the finest and best alloy. Although many have endeavoured to trace the origin of these stones, all attempts have hitherto been vain ; nor have there been any stones of a similar nature even discovered in the neighbouringrivers or serranias, so that it is thought that they must have been thrown to that spot by some earthquake. 
In these mountains are a great number of apes, parrots, pheasants, and other birds, who are secured by the uncultivated and craggy parts of the territory they inhabit. The temperatures of the several parts differ much ; and here are not wanting many lions, tigers, and venomous serpents, which they call nauyaques.

It is of an agreeable and benign temperature, abounding in every species of fruit and seeds, and its population is composed 6*f more than 200 housekeepers, and 100 Indians ; close to the settlement of Tabio, where its jurisdiction terminates. Here are still remaining the vestiges of the road which led to Santa Fe.

All speak French and  Mobilian, and live much like their neighbours, the Pescagolas.] 
[TENNANT'S Harbour, on the coast of the district of Maine, lies about three leagues from George's Islands.] 

[==[[Tennessee|TENNESSEE]]==, a large, beautiful, and navigable river of the State of Tennessee, called by the French Cherokee, and absurdly by others Hogohegee River, is the largest branch of the Ohio. It rises in the mountains of S. Carolina with the name Tennessee, in about lat. 35° n. but its most remote sources are in Virginia, in lat. 37° 10', and pursues by its course about 1000 English miles s. and s. w. nearly to lat. 34° 30', receiving from both sides a number of large tributary streams. It then wheels about to the n. in a circuitous course, and mingles with the Ohio, nearly 60 miles from its mouth. It is navigable for vessels of great burden to the Muscle Shoals, 250 English miles from its mouth. It is there about three miles broad, full of small isles, and only passable in small boats or batteaux. From these shoals to the Whirl, or Suck, the place where the river is contracted to the breadth of 70 yards, and breaks through the Great Ridge, or Cumberland Mountain, is 250 miles, and the navigation for large boats all the way excellent. The highest point of navigation upon this river is Tellico Blockhouse, 900 miles from its mouth, according to its meanders. It receives Holston River 22 miles below Knoxville, and then running w. 15 miles receives the Clinch. The other waters which empty into Tennessee, are Duck and Elk Rivers, and Crow Creek, on the one side and the Occachappo, Chickamauga, and Hiwassee rivers on the s. and s. e. sides. 
In the Tennessee and its upper branches are great numbers of fish, some of which are very large and of an excellent flavour. The river to which the name Tennessee was formerly confined, is that part of it which runs n. and receives Holston River 20 miles below Knoxville. The Coyeta, Chota, and Chilawee Indian towns, are on the w. side of the river ; and the Talasse Town on the e. side.] 
[Tennessee, East and West, form one of the United States of America, and, until 1796, were called the Tennessee Government, or Territory of the United States s. of the Ohio. This State is in length 410 miles, and in breadth 90; between lat. 35° and 36° 30' n. and long. 81° 52' and 90° 3' w. It is bounded n. by Kentucky and part of Virginia; e. by N. Carolina; s. by Georgia ; w. by the Mississippi. It is divided into three districts, viz. Washington, Hamilton,  and Mero, which are subdivided into 13 counties, viz. Washington, Sullivan, Greene, Carter, Hawkins, Knox, Jefferson, Sevier, Blount, Grainger, Davidson, Sumner, Robertson, and Montgomery. The first four belong to Washington District, the next five to that of Hamilton, and the four latter to Mero District. The two former districts are divided from the latter, by an uninhabited country of 91 miles in extent; that is, from the blockhouses at the point formed by the junction of the river Clinch with the Tennessee, called S. W. Point, to Fort Blount upon Cumberland River, through which there is a waggonroad, opened in the summer of 1795. 
There are few countries so well watered with rivers and creeks. The principal rivers are the Mississippi, Tennessee, Cumberland, Holston, and Clinch. The tract called the Broken Ground sends immediately into the Mississippi, the Wolf, Hatchee, Forked-Deer, Obian or Obean, and Reelfoot ; which are from 30 to 80 yards wide at their mouths : most of the rivers have exceedingly rich low grounds, at the extremity of which is a second bank, as on most of the lands of the Mississippi. Besides these rivers, there are several smaller ones, and innumerable creeks, some of which are navigable. In short, there is hardly a spot in this country which is upwards of 20 miles distant from a navigable stream. 
The chief mountains are, Stone, Yellow, Iron, Bald, and Unaka, adjoining to one another, from the e. boundary of the State, and separate it from N. Carolina; their direction is nearly from n. e. to 5. w. The other mountains are Clinch and Cumberland. It would require a volume to describe the mountains of this State, above half of which is covered with those that are uninhabitable. Some of these mountains, particularly the Cumberland, or Great Laurel Ridge, are the most stupendous piles in the United States. They abound with ginseng and coal. The caverns and cascades in these mountains are innumerable. The Enchanted Mountain, about two miles s. of Brass Town, is famed for the curiosities on its rocks. 
There are on several rocks a number of impressions resembling the tracks of turkeys, bears horses, and human beings, as visible and perfect as they could be made on snow or sand. The latter were remarkable for having uniformly six toes each, one only excepted, which appeared to be the print of a Negro's foot. By this we must suppose the originals to have been the progeny of Titan or Anak. One of these tracks was very large, the length of the foot 16 inches,] 3 y 2  

STiME£   SB  TENNESSEE.  
[the distance of the extremes of the outer toes 13 inches, the proximate breadth behind the toes seven inches, the diameter of the heelball five. One of the horsetracks was likewise of an uncommon size, the transverse and conjugate diameters were eight bj ten inches; perhaps the horse which the Great Warrior rode. 
What appears the most in favour of their being the real tracks of the animals they represent, is the circumstance of a horse's foot having apparently slipped several inches, and recovered again, and the figures having all the same direction, like the trail of a company on a journey. If it be a lusus naturae, the old dame never sported more seriously. If the operation of chance, perhaps there was never more apparent design. If it were done by art, it might be to perpetuate the remembrance of some remarkable event of war, or engagement fought on the ground. The vast heaps of stones near the place, said to be tombs of warriors slain in battle, seem to favour the supposition. The texture of the rocks is soft. The part on which the sun had the greatest influence, and which was the most indurated, could easily be cut with a knife, and appeared to be of the nature of the pipestone. Some of the Cherokees entertain an opinion that it always rains when any person visits the place, as if sympathetic nature wept at the recollection of the dreadful catastrophe which those figures were intended to commemorate. 
The principal towns are, Knoxville, the seat of government, Nashville, and Jonesborough, besides eight other towns, which are as yet of little importance. In 1791, the number of inhabitants was estimated at 35,691. In November, 1795, the number had increased to 77,262 persons, and, by the census of 1810, the total population was in East Tennessee - 101,367 West Tennessee - 160,360

The soil is luxuriant, and will afford every production, the growth of any of the United States. The usual crop of cotton is 800 lbs. to the acre, of a long and fine staple ; and of corn, from 60 to 80 bushels. It is asserted, however, that the lands on the small rivers, that empty into the Mississippi, have a decided preference to those on Cumberland River, for the production of cotton, rice, and indigo. Of trees, the general growth is poplar, hickory, black and white walnut, all kinds of oaks, buckeye, beech,  sycamore, black and honey locust, ash, hornbeam, elm, mulberry, cherry, dogwood, sassafras, poppaw, cucumbertree, and the sugartree. The undergrowth, especially on low lands, is cane ; some of which are upwards of 20 feet high, and so thick as to prevent any other plant from growing. Of herbs, roots, and shrubs, there are, Virginia and Seneca snakeroot, ginseng, angelica, spicewood, wild plum, crabapple, sweet annise, redbud, ginger, spikenard, wild hop, and grape vines. The glades are covered with wild rye, wild oats, clover, buffaloegrass, strawberries, and peavines. On the hills, at the head of rivers, and in some high cliffs of Cumberland, are found majestic red cedars ; many of these are four feet in diameter, and 40 feet clear of limbs. 
The animals are such as are found in the neighbouring states. The rivers are well stocked with all kinds of fresh water fish ; among which are trout, perch, catfish, buffaloefish, redhorse, eels, &c. Some catfish have been caught which weighed upwards of 100 pounds; the w. waters being more clear and pure than the e. rivers, the fish are in the same degree more firm and savoury to the taste. 
The climate is temperate and healthful; the summers are very cool and pleasant in that part which is contiguous to the mountains that divide this State from N. Carolina ; but on the w. side of the Cumberland Mountains the heat is more intense, which renders that part better calculated for the production of tobacco, cotton, and indigo. Limestone is common on both sides of Cumberland Mountain. There are no stagnant waters ; and this is certainly one of the reasons why the inhabitants are not afflicted with those bilious and intermitting fevers, which are so frequent and often fatal near the same latitude on the coast of the S. States. Whatever may be the cause, the inhabitants have been remarkably healthy since they settled on the waters of Cumberland River. 
The country abounds with mineral springs. Salt licks are found in many parts of the country. [See Campbell's Salines.] Iron ore abounds in the districts of Washington and Hamilton, and fine streams to put ironworks in operation. Iron ore was lately discovered upon the s. of Cumberland River, about 30 miles below Nashville, and a furnace is now erecting. Several leadmines have been discovered, and one on French Broad has been worked ; the ore produced 75 per cent, in pure lead. The Indians say, that there are rich silvermines in Cumber-}

[land Mountain ; but cannot be tempted to discover any of them to the white people. It is said that gold has been found here ; but the mine from which that metal was extracted is now unknown to the white people. Ores and springs strongly impregnated with sulphur are found in various parts. Saltpetre caves are numerous; and in the course of the year 1796, several tons of saltpetre were sent to the Atlantic markets. 
This country furnishes all the valuable articles of the S. States. Fine waggon and saddle horses, beefcattle, ginseng, deerskins and furs, cotton, hemp, and flax, may be transported by land ; also iron, lumber, pork, and flour, may be exported in great quantities, now that the navigation of the Mississippi is opened to the citizens of the United States : but few of the inhabitants understand commerce, or are possessed of proper capitals ; of course it is as yet but badly managed. However, being now an independent state, it is to be hoped that the eyes of the people will soon be opened to their true interest, and agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, will each receive proper attention. 
The Presbyterians are the prevailing denomination of Christians ; in 1788, they had 23 large congregations, who were then supplied by only six ministers. There are also some Baptists and Methodists. The inhabitants have paid great attention to the interests of science; besides private schools, there are three colleges established by law ; Greenville in Green's County, Blount at Knoxville, and Washington in the county of that name. Here is likewise a " Society for promoting Useful Knowledge." A taste for literature is daily increasing. The inhabitants chiefly emigrated from Pennsylvania, and that part of Virginia that lies w. of the Blue Ridge. The ancestors of these people were generally of the Scotch nation, some of whom emigrated, first to Ireland, and from thence to America. A few Germans and English are intermixed. In 1788, it was thought there were 20 white persons to one Negro; and the disproportion is thought to be far greater now. 
This country was included in the second charter of king Charles II. to the proprietors of Carolina. In a subsequent division it made a part of N. Carolina. It was explored about the year 1745, and settled by about 50 families in 1754 ; who were soon after driven off or destroyed by the Indians. Its settlement recommenced in 1765. The first permanent settlement took place near Long Island of Holston, and upon Watauga, about 1774 ; and the first appearance of anv persons from it, in the public councils of N.  
Carolina, was in the convention of that State in 1776. In the year 1780, a party of about 40 families, under the guidance and direction of James Robertson (since Brigadier-General Robertson of Mero District), passed through a wilderness of at least 300 miles to the French Lick, and there founded Nashville. Their nearest neighbours were the settlers of the infant state of Kentucky, between whom and them was a wilderness of 200 miles. From the year 1784 to 1788 the government of N. Carolina over this country was interrupted by the assumed State of Frankland ; but, in the year 1789, the people returned to their allegiance. In 1789, N. Carolina ceded this territory to the United States, on cei'tain conditions, and Congress provided for its government. A convention was held at Knoxville, in 1796, and on the 6th of February the constitution of the State of Tennessee was signed by every member of it. Its principles promise to ensure the happiness and prosperity of the people. The following are the distances on the new road from Nashville, in Davidson County, to Fort Campbell, near the junction of Holston with the Tennessee.

==[[Tepeaca|TEPEACA]]==, a province and alcaldia mayor of Nueva Espana, in the bishopric of La Puebla de los Angeles. It is of a great extent, and generally of a hot temperature, although it has parts, some of which are warm and others cold. It abounds greatly in small cattle, of the wools of which they make woven stuffs, in which consists its principal commerce. It produces also much wheat, barley, and other seeds, the crops of which are abundant ; and not less in fruit, flowers, and garden herbs. In the celebrated valley of Balzaquillo, which is extensive, there are 56 cultivated estates. In this jurisdiction is the volcano of Orazava. Its numerous population consists of the following settlement : Tepeaca, the capital, which is the city of its name, was founded near a mountain, of a moderately hot temperature, and with fine fresh water, although, at times, it is badly supplied with this article, the whole of it coming from the lofty sierra of Tlaxcala, which is seven leagues distant. The inhabitants have, therefore, the precaution of saving it in cisterns, and from these the town is supplied. 
The population is composed of 80 families of Spaniards, 102 of Mustees, 22 of Mulattoes, and 481 of Indians. The principal square is large, and, in the middle of it, is a fort which served as a retreat and place of defence to the valorous Hernan Cortes and his army, upon his retiring from Mexico. This building is now in a state of great dilapidation, having undergone no repair whatever since that time. In one of the fronts of the said square, namely, that which looks to the e. is the convent of San Francisco, a large, magnificent, and beautiful building, founded entirely on arches, all the expenses of it having been defrayed by Cortes and his captains ; and, although 250 years have now elapsed, yet is it entirely free from all damage or want of repair. On the other side of the square, and opposite this convent, is the parishchurch, not so large, but of equal beauty and architecture.  T E P 
This city has several woollen cloth manufactories, and in these consists its principal commerce with the other provinces. In its head settlement are 26 cultivated estates, inhabited by 177 families of Indians, and in which they gather abundant crops of wheat, barley, and other seeds, and, of the former alone, more than 100,000 fanegas (bushels) yearly.

VOL. IV.    ==[[Tepeguanes|TEPEGUANES]]==, a settlement and garrison of Nueva Espana, on the shore of the river of Las Nasas, and founded to restrain the Infidel Indians of this nation ; who were at last destroyed through the exertions of the Count San Pedro del Alamo, who was sent to defend this territory. The nation of barbarous Indians, from whom the above settlement took its name, inhabited the jurisdiction of the kingdom of Nueva Vizcaya, and was one of the most ferocious^ and valorous races of those regions, although not very numerous. They lived in temporary huts between rOcky and broken places ; they prided themselves as being superior to any of the Indians with whom they engaged, and particularly to the Acaxees and Taraumaras, their neighbours, and these were kept in such awe, as to permit them to carry away from their settlements their wives, without offering any resistance. 
The Spaniards, allured by the richness of the silvermines, established themselves pacifically amongst these Indians, and the father, Geronimo Ramirez, of the Jesuits, entered amongst them to preach to them the faith. He founded the settlements of Santiago and Santa Catalina, and the numbers of his proselytes were daily encreasing by the labours of other missionaries until 1616, when there was a general apostacy, a rebellion being excited amongst the other nations, and the father, Hernando de Tovar, of the Jesuits ; the father Juan de Gurierez, a Franciscan, being put to death, together with 200 Spaniards, who were made to undergo the greatest tortures. But the governor of Nueva Vizcaya, Don Gaspar de Alvear, of the order of Santiago, after several attempts, induced them at last to submit to be instructed by the missionaries of the Jesuits.

==[[Tequendama|TEQUENDAMA]]==, a celebrated fall of the river Bogota, in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada ; and which is looked upon as a prodigy of nature : for the impetuous current of this river being confined within very narrow limits, bursts forth through an opening at the top of the sierra as it were through a spout, forming by its waters a bow of 220 fathoms in length, and altogether with a noise so tremendous as to be heard at seven leagues distance. The water falls into a basin of more than a league in circumference. The quantity and force of the falling water causes thick clouds to arise around this spot, insomuch as that it is impossible to examine it in the evening; but, in the morning it forms a spectacle the most delightful, for the rays of the sun beaming upon the spray of the waters, a thousand beautiful rainbows are formed ; and the whole prospect is, rendered grand and sublime by the immense square stones which form the basin, and which are as perfect as though they had been cut by the chisel and with the greatest labour. 
The tops of these stones are covered with beautiful trees and flowers, and the whole prospect, with the delightful song of a multitude of birds, forms a complete paradise.

==[[Tercero|TERCERO]]==, a river of the province and government of Tucuman in Peru ; it rises in the serranias to the s. w. of the city of Cordoba, called mountains of Achala; runs e. collecting the waters of a smaller river, called Saladillo. On its shores are many estates of cattle, which are frequently attacked and plundered by the Abipones and Guaicurus Indians. Whenever this river is high, its pass is difficult, though the Indians of the district are very dextrous in crossing it in a cowskin, as in a basket, drawn by two horses. [It enters the river Parana just above the town of Rosario, and 7.3 miles s. of the city of Santa Fe.j 

==[[Teremendo|TEREMENDO]]==, a jurisdiction and alcaldia mayor of the province and bishopric of Mechoacan in Nueva Espana. It is much reduced and profitless, not being able to support its corregidor ; and it is thus looked upon as united to the jurisdiction of Xocona. It is of a cold temperature, and produces nothing but what is just necessary to support its scanty population. It consists only of a capital of its name, with 90 families of Indians, and of the settlement of Jaso, very close to it, and of six or eight Spanish families, who live in some ranchos and cowsheds of its district. At a little distance is a mountain thickly covered with trees and shrubs, in which have been discovered mines of silver of excellent quality; and in 1712, there was found in a deep glen a very capacious mouth, or entrance of a certain cave, but which the Spaniards were afraid of entering from the idea that it was inhabited by wild beasts. They accordingly let off at its mouth different fireworks, which caused several foxes, and screech owls, and crows, to issue from it; and then entering it with lighted torches, they dicovered some prodigious apartments or vaults, which had belonged to the Indians in their gentilism, and which were supported by very strong walls. 
In the middle of the second of these vaults was found a bank in the shape of an altar, on which were a certain number of idols and newlymade offerings, such as of copal or incense, and of woollen yarn, as also various figures of men and animals. On examination of the manner in which this cave was built, it was found that the stones were of a nature very easy to be wrought, and that the angles between the tops on the out-    544    
T E 11  side of the several vaults had been so connected together, and rendered one plain superficies by means of burning wood upon them ; that they had, through course of time, become a plain covered with thick trees. This settlement is eight leagues from the capital Valladolid, to w. s. w.

==[[Terrenafe|TERRENAFE]]==, a large and populous settlement in the province and correghniento of Sana and kingdom of Peru. 
[TERRITORY N.W. of the Ohio, or N.W. Territory, a large part of the United States, is situated between lat. 37° and 50° n. and between lonjr. 81° 8' and 98° 8' w. Its greatest  length is about 900 miles, and its breadth 700. This extensive tract of country is bounded n. by part of the n. boundary line of the United States; e. by the lakes and Pennsylvania; s. by the Ohio River; w. by the Mississippi. Mr. Hutchins, the late geographer of the United States, estimates that this tract contains 263,040,000 acres, of which 43,040,000 are water ; this deducted, there will remain 220,000,000 of acres, belonging to the Federal Government, to be sold for the discharge of the national debt ; except a narrow strip of land bordering on the s. of Lake Erie, and stretching 120 miles w. of the w. limit of Pennsylvania, which belongs to Connecticut. But a small portion of these lands is yet purchased of the natives, and to be disposed of by Congress. Beginning on the meridian line, which forms the w. boundary of Pennsylvania, seven ranges of townships have been surveyed and laid off by order of Congress. As a n. and s. line strikes the Ohio in an oblique direction, the termination of the seventh range falls upon that river, nine miles above the Muskingum, which is the first large river that falls into the Ohio. It forms this junction 172 miles below Fort Pitt, including the windings of the Ohio, though, in a direct line, it is but 90 miles. That part of this territory in which the Indian title is extinguished, and which is settling under the government of the United States, is divided into five counties, as follows : 
Counties. When erected. 
Washington, - - - July 26th, 1788. 
Hamilton, - - - - Jan. 2d, 1790. 
St. Clair, - - - - April 27th, 1790. 
Knox, ----- June 20th, 1793. 
Wayne, 1796. 
These counties have been organized with the proper civil and military officers. The county of St. Clair is divided into three districts, viz.  

TERRITORY N. W. OF THE OHIO.  [the district of Cahokia, the district of Prairiedurochers, and the district of Kaskaskias. Courts of general quartersessions of the peace, country courts of common pleas, and courts of probate, to be held in each of these districts, as if each was a distinct county ; the officers of the county to act by deputy, except in the district where they reside. 
The principal rivers in this territory are, Muskingum, Hockhocking, Sciota, Great and Little Miami, Blue and Wabash, which empty into the Ohio ; Au Vase, Illinois, Ouisconsing, and Chippeway, which pay tribute to the Mississippi, besides a number of smaller ones. St. Lewis, Kennomic, St. Joseph's, Barbue, Grand, Miami of the Lakes, Sandusky, Cayahoga, and many others which pass to the lakes. Between the Kaskaskias and Illinois Rivers, which are 84 miles apart, is an extensive tract of level rich land, which terminates in a high ridge, about 15 miles before you reach the Illinois River. In this delightful vale are a number of French villages, which, together with those of St. Genevieve, and St. Louis, on the w. side of the Mississippi, contained, in 1771, 1273 fencible men. 
The number of souls in this large tract of country has not been ascertained. From the best data that has been received, the population was estimated, in 1792, as follows : 
Indians (suppose), - - - . 65,000 1792 
Ohio Company purchase, - 2,500 do. 
Colonel Symmes's settlements, 2,000 do. 
Galliopolis (French settlements), opposite the Kanhawy River, 1,000 do. 
Vincennes and its vicinity, on the Wabash, ----- 1,500 do. 
Kaskaskias and Cahokia, - - 680 1790 
At Grand Ruisseau, village of St. 
Phillip, and Prairiedurochers, 240 do.  
Total 72,920 
In 1790, there were in the town of Vincennes about 40 American families and 31 slaves, and on the Mississippi 40 American families and 73 slaves, all included in the above estimate. On the Spanish or w. side of the Mississippi there were, in 1790, about 1800 souls, principally at Genevieve and St. Louis. 
The lands on the various rivers which water this Territory, are interspersed with all the variety of soil which conduces to pleasantness of situation, and lays the foundation for the wealth of an agricultural and manufacturing people. 

VOL. IV.  
Large level bottoms, or natural meadows, from 20 to 50 miles in circuit, are found bordering the rivers, and variegating the country in the interior parts. These afford as rich a soil as can be imagined, and may be reduced to proper cultivation with very little labour. The pre-  vailing growth  of timber, and the most useful  trees, are, maple or sugartree, sycamore, black and white mulberry, black and white walnut, butternut, chesnut; white, black, Spanish, and chesnut oaks, hickory, cherry, buckwood or horsechesnut, honeylocust, elm, cucumbertrees, lynntree, gumtree, ironwood, ash, aspin, sassafras, crabapple tree, paupaw or custard apple, a variety of plum trees, nine bark spice, and leatherwood bushes. White and black oak, and chesnut, with most of the abovementioned timbers, grow large and plenty upon the high grounds. Both the high and low lands produce great quantities of natural grapes of various kinds, of which the settlers universally make a sufficiency for their own consumption, of rich red wine. It is asserted in the old settlement of St. Vincent, where they have had opportunity to try it, that age will render this wine preferable to most of the European wines. Cotton is said to be the natural production of this country, and to grow in great perfection. The sugarmaple is the most tree for an inland country. Any number of inhabitants may be for ever supplied with a sufficiency of sugar, by preserving a few trees for the use of each family. A tree will yield about lOlbs. of sugar a year, and the labour is very trifling. Springs of excellent water abound in this territory, and small and large streams, for mills and other purposes, are actually interspersed, as if by art, that there be no deficiency in any of the conveniences of life. Very little waste land is to be found in any part of this tract of country. There are no swamps but such as may be readily drained, and made into arable and meadow land; and though the hills are frequent, they are gentle, and swelling no where high, or incapable of tillage. They are of a deep rich soil, covered with a heavy growth of timber, and well adapted to the production of wheat, rye, indigo, tobacco, &c. 
The communication between this country and the sea will be principally in the four following directions : 1. The route through the Scioto and Muskingum to Lake Erie, and so to the river Hudson, described under New York head. 2. The passage up the Ohio and Monongahela to the portage above mentioned, which leads to the navigable waters of the Patowmack. This port-] 4 A  TERRITORY N. W. OF THE OHIO.  
[age is SO miles, and will probably be rendered much less by the execution of theplans now on foot for openin 3. The Great  the navigation of those waters.  
Lanhaway,  which falls into the  
Ohio from the Virginia shore, between the  
Hockhocking and the Scioto, opens an extensive navigation from the s. e. and leaves but 18 miles portage from the navigable waters of James's River in Virginia. This communication, for the country between Muskingum and Scioto, will probably be more used than any other for the exportation of manufactures, and other light and valuable articles, and especially for the importation of foreign commodities, which may be brought from the Chesapeak to the Ohio much cheaper than .they are now carried from Philadelphia to Carlisle, and the other thicksettled back counties of Pennsylvania ; though, indeed, a gentleman of much observation, and a great traveller in this country, is of opinion that this communication, or route, is chimerical. 4. But the current down the Ohio and the Mississippi, for heavy articles that suit the Florida and W. India markets, such as corn, flour, beef, lumber, &c. will be perhaps as frequently loaded as any stream on earth. 
The distance from the Scioto to the Mississippi is 800 English miles ; from thence to the sea is 900, including its meanders. This whole course is easily run in 15 days ; and the passage up those rivers is not so difficult as has usually been represented. It is found, by late experiments, that sails are used to great advantage against the current of the Ohio ; and it is worthy of observation, that in all probability steam boats will be found to do infinite service in all the extensive river navigation. 
No country is better stocked with wild game of every kind. The rivers are well stored with fish of various kinds, and many of them are of an excellent quality. They are generally large, though of different sizes ; the catfish, which is the largest, and of a delicious flavour, weighs from six to eighty pounds. 
The number of old forts found in this w. country are the admiration of the curious, and a  matter of much speculation. They  of an oblong form, situated on  ire mostly ng wellchosen ground, and contiguous to water. When, by whom, and for what purpose, these were thrown up, is uncertain. They are undoubtedly very ancient, as there is not the least visible difference in the age or size of the timber growing en or within these forts, and that which grows without ; and the oldest natives have lost  all tradition respecting them. There are posts established for the protection of the frontiers. 
By an ordinance of Congress, passed on the 13th of July, 1787, this country, for the purposes of temporary government, was erected into one district, subject, however, to a division, when circumstances shall make it expedient. The ordinance of Congress, of July 13th, 1787, article 5th, provides, that there shall be formed in this territory, not less than three, nor more than H\e states ; and the boundaries of the states shall become fixed and established as follows, viz. the w. state in the said territory shall be bounded on the Mississippi, the Ohio, and Wabash rivers ; a direct line drawn from the Wabash and Post Vincents due n. to the territorial line between the United States and Canada, and by the said territorial line to the Lake of the Woods and Mississippi. The middle state shall be bounded by the said direct line, the Wabash from Post Vincents to the Ohio ; by the Ohio by a direct line drawn due n. from the mouth of the Great Miami to the said territorial line, and by the said territorial line. The e. state shall be bounded by the lastmentioned direct line, the Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the said territorial line : — provided however, and it is further understood and declared, that the boundaries of these three states shall be subject so far to be altered, that if Congress hereafter shall find it expedient, they shall have authority to form one or two states, in that part of the said territory which lies n. of an e. and w. line drawn through the 5. bend or extreme of Lake Michigan : and when any of the said states shall have 60,000 free inhabitants therein, such state shall be admitted by its delegates into the Congress of the United States, on an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatever ; and shall be at liberty to form a permanent constitution and state government; provided the constitution and government so to be formed shall be republican, and in conformity to the principles contained in these articles ; and so far as it can be consistent with the general interest of the confederacy, such admission shall be allowed at an earlier period, and when there may be a less number of free inhabitants in the state than 60,000. 
The settlement of this country has been checked, for several years past, by the unhappy Indian war, an amicable termination of which took place on the 3d of August, 1795, when a treaty was formed at Grenville, between Majorgeneral Anthony Wayne, on the part of the United States, and the chiefs of the following]   T E R 
[tribes of Indians, viz. the Wyandots, Delawares, Shawanoes, Ottawas, Chippewas, Putawatimes, Miamis, Eel River, Weeas, Kickapoos, Pian Kashaws and Kaskaskias. By the third article of this treaty, the Indians cede to the United States, for a valuable consideration, all lands lying e. and s. of a line " beginning at the mouth of Cayahoga River, and running thence up the same to the portage between that and the Tuscarawas Branch of the Muskingum ; thence .down that branch to the crossingplace above Fort Lawrence ; thence w. to a fork of that branch of the great Miami River, running into the Ohio, where commences the portage between the Miami of the Ohio, and St. Mary's River, which is a branch of the Miami of the Lake ; thence a w. course to Fort Recovery, which stands on a branch of the Wabash, then s. w. in a direct line to the Ohio, so as to intersect that river opposite the mouth of Kentucky or Catawa River." Sixteen tracts of land, of six and 12 miles square, interspersed at convenient distances in the Indian country, were, by the same treaty, ceded to the United States, for the convenience of keeping up a friendly and beneficial intercourse between the parties. The United States, on their part, " relinquish their claims to all other Indian lands n. of the river Ohio, e. of the Mississippi, and w. and s. of the Great Lakes and the waters uniting them, according to the boundaryline agreed on by the United States and the king of Great Britain, in the treaty of peace made between them in the year 1783. 
But from this relinquishment, by the United States, the following tracts of land are explicitly excepted. — 1st. The tract of 150,000 acres near the Rapids of the Ohio River, which has been assigned to General Clark, for the use of himself and his warriors. 2d. The post of St. Vincents on the river Wabash, and the lands adjacent ; of which the Indian title has been extinguished. 3d. The land at all other places in possession of the French people and other white settlers among them, of which the Indian title has been extinguished, as mentioned in the third article ; and, 4th. The post of Fort Massac, towards the mouth of the Ohio. To which several parcels of land so excepted, the said tribes relinquish all the title and claim which they or any of them may have." Goods to the value of 20,000 dollars were delivered the Indians at the time this treaty was made ; and goods to the amount of 9500 dollars, at first cost in the United States, are to be delivered annually to the Indians at some convenient place n. of the Ohio.    A trade has been opened, since this treaty, by a law of Congress, with the forementioned tribes of Indians, on a liberal footing, which promises to give permanency to this treaty, and security to the frontier inhabitants.]

==[[Tetela|TETELA]]==, Del Volcan, a jurisdiction and alcaldia mayor of Nueva Espana. It is one of the most limited and reduced of that kingdom ; since its limits do not exceed five leagues from n. to s. and since its whole territory is of mountains and deep ravines totally incapable of cultivation. It is two leagues wide from e. to w. and in its few plains are gathered some scanty crops of maize, lentils, and fruits of the country ; these affording its only branch of trade. For, although they formerly collected large quantities of cochineal, yet has this custom entirely fallen off, from the Indians having lost the nopaleras, from which the cochineal was procured ; again, although it is known that there are some silvermines in this jurisdiction, yet are they not worked. It was in former times more populous, as well in Spaniards as in Indians, but when its productions began to decline, its inhabitants betook themselves to the neighbouring jurisdictions ; and, indeed, those that remain, pay their tribute in the jurisdiction of Coautla Amilpas, and obtain necessaries out of the jurisdiction. Its population consists of only three settlements, which are,, Metepee, Xuehicalco, Hueyapan. Tetela, the capital, is the settlement of the same name, contains 100 families of Mexican Indians, and 10 of Spaniards, and a convent of Dominicans. Twenty leagues s. e. of Mexico.

It contains 80 families of Indians, and seven of Mustees, whose  trade is very small. Fifteen leagues s. e. of its head settlement. 
Tetela, another, a real of silvermines, and a modern town, of the same head settlement and cdcaldia mayor as the former. 
Tetela, another, also a real of silvermines, of the alcaldia mayor of Zetela Xonotla. It contains 32 families of Spaniards, 107 of Mulattoes, Mustees, and Negroes, who, at the cost of the miners, have erected a beautiful temple, which is a chapel of ease of the head settlement of the district of Xonotla. In this settlement resides the lieutenant of the alcalde mayor: Its inhabitants are employed in sowing seeds, cutting woods, and making charcoal, and torches for the use of the mine. In this mine there is a vein of gold, but of such base alloy as to render but little profit, so that the mine is worked very little. 
Tetela, another jurisdiction and alcaldia mayor, with the addition of Xonotla. It is small and much reduced, and its trade consists in the working of one mine, which, although there be many others, is the only one that is worked. The inhabitants sow maize, French beans, beans, and axonjoli, and of these they gather great crops, as the soil is particularly favourable to their cultivation. The nuts here are also much esteemed in all the provinces, and especially at Mexico, whither there is a great quantity regularly carried. In all this jurisdiction there is no other than one estate called Totonalapa, which is two leagues from the capital, and in which they breed much large and small cattle. This alcaldia is composed of two districts ; the one of Tetela and the other of Xonolta ; so that it takes the name of both. In the former the population is reduced to three settlements besides the capital, and which are, 
San Pedro, San Christoval, San Estevan. And the second to five, which are, 
San Martin, San Andres, 
San Francisco, Los Reyes. 
Santiago, Tetela, the capital of them all, which, as we have observed, is of the same name, is of a cold and moist temperature, contains 242 families of Indians, and 40 of Spaniards. Before it runs an abundant stream, which, diffusing its waters through that territory, renders it fertile and delightful: and there are here, in consequence, many gardens full of flowers, fruits, and pulse. The said river, after surrounding the real of the mines, fertilizes its district. Thirtysix leagues n. of Mexico.

It is much reduced, and, in consequence, there have been added to it the districts of Huipuxtla and Mizquiahuala. It is very scarce of water, and the natives cultivate nothing but some wheat and maize with labour, dedicating themselves rather to the fattening of swine, in which consist their principal trade ; and, although in the gardens they gather some fruits, yet, as from the distance, they cannot carry them to Mexico, they are of little profit. It is computed that this district contains 1000 families of Indians, who, for the most part, live in the cultivated estates and in the ranchos, where there are also 100 other families of Spaniards, Mustees, and Mulattoes.

It also produces many woods, which they carry in canoes . to Mexico by the lake • nor do they want manufactories, where they make no small quantity of serges and other stuffs from the wool of the cattle which is found here in tolerable numbers. Here are also breeds of swine, and with these, besides some salt, does this jurisdiction carry on a fair trade with the capital and the neighbouring jurisdictions. It enjoys a benign and mild temperature, but is scantily supplied with water for irrigation. Its population consists of 16 principal settlements or head settlements of the district, and of many smaller. Tezcoco, the capital, is the city of the same name, which, through corruption, they call com-   nronly Tezcuco. It was in the time of the gentilism of the Indians, one of the most populous and celebrated ; governed by many kings of various nations, especially of the Chichimecan. It was here that the king Nazahualcoyot, so famous as well for valour as for government, maintained his sovereignty ; and, after the establishment of the Mexican empire, it was the court of the princes of the race of Moctezuma, and was, consequently, a place of great magnificence. It was also the military school, wherein was taught the management of arms, and the characters in which their histories were written, and which were similar to the hieroglyphics used by the Egyptians. In these they handed down to posterity the rites and ceremonies of their false religion," and they had a method of forming their calendars so exact as to keep the nicest account of the years, of the movements of the stars, and of the increase and wane of the moon ; and thus did they, without the knowledge of a single letter, clearly explain, by figures of men and animals, whatsoever they wished to transmit to memory. 
At the time of the conquest by the Spaniards, when Cortes drew near to this city, Moctezuma assembled in it all his augurs and necromancers, to consult them ; and in it the same Hernan Cortes afterwards held his garrison, and built some brigantines, making all the other necessary arrangements for the siege of Mexico. At present this beautiful town is nearly destroyed, from the want of trade ; although it still has some magnificent buildings, in memory of what it was. Its streets are very wide and handsome, and is the first city wherein the Spanish government was established in that kingdom. 
It has a very fine convent of Franciscans, and another of San Juan de Dios, which is an hospital : it is inhabited by 1250 families of Indians, and 150 of Spaniards, Mulattoes, and Mustees. At half a league's distance from it is the holy sanctuary of Nuestra Senora de Tulantongo, which is the chapel of ease to the city : in the same is a beautiful picture on a tablet of three quarters of a yard long, and of twothirds wide. There is a tradition that this picture, having been damaged in the house of a certain Indian, was conveyed to a blind Indian, a neighbour, in order that he might pray before it, to be released from his infirmity ; and that whilst he was praying, he heard a voice, telling him to wash his eyes with the water of the well which is in the church ; that he immediately did so, and recovered his sight, whilst the image presented itself to his view in a perfect state. The whole of the city   T E Z 
Was soon assembled to witness this prodigy, and ever since that time, now 200 years, have the colours of the painting remained as lively as though they were just laid on ; and the most extraordinary devotion is manifested towards it, as well by the inhabitants of this as of the other, the most distant jurisdictions. 
[This city formerly possessed very considerable cotton manufactories ; but they have suffered much in a competition with those of Queretaro. Its present population, according to Humboldt, amounts to 5000. It is 15 miles e. n. e. of Mexico, at the foot of the sierra, which is the e. wall of the valley of Tenoxtitlan ; in lat. 19° 31' 30" n. and long. 98° 52' w.~]

Thomas, S. another, with the surname of Castilla, in the province and government of Honduras and kingdom of Guatemala. It is a small population, established from the convenience of its port, which is very secure and much frequented. It was discovered by the Spaniards in 1525, on the day of St. Thomas Aquinas, and from this circumstance it took its name. It has a castle, built for its defence, and is 60 leagues from the capital, Guatemala. 
Thomas, S. an island of the N. Sea, one of the Antilles, or Virgin Islands, the largest of them to the e. of Puertorico, and that which, according to Molly, is nearest to the Anegada, although the father Labat places it more zi>. [It is, accurately speaking, 10 miles long and three wide.] It abounds greatly in papas, millet, and other seeds, fruits and garden herbs, but much infested by mosquitoes and insects. 
The English established themselves in this island, together with some French, Who were driven from their own country. Percy asserts that this island produces oranges, citrons, limes, guavas, plantains, and figs; and, according to father Labat, it has very few horses and large cattle ; but is provided with fleshmeat from the island of Puertorico. In this island are found excellent kids, and all sorts of wild birds; though its great population and riches cause every thing to be very dear. 
William Dampierre calls the port of this island Port Franco, and a receptacle for pirates ; asserting that it belongs to the King of Denmark, as well as the island itself, and that it regularly maintains its neutrality in the wars of Europe ; is open for all nations, and is very large, convenient, and safe : it has two natural ramparts, whereon, in case of necessity, might be planted two batteries to defend the entrance. Although this island is not more than six or seven leagues in circumference, a part of it is held by the Brandenburgans, under the protection of the King of Denmark ; but the whole of the trade is carried on by the Dutch, under the name of the Danes* Nearly in the centre of the fort is a small port, but without a ditch or any other work ; and the city, which begins about 60 paces to the a), of the fort, consists of a very long street, at the end of which is the factory : this is a very large building, with necessary storehouses for the merchandise, and for receiving the Negroes, who are 4b 2  T H O  here sold to other nations. On the right hand of this factory is the part appropriated to the merchants or traders of Brandenburg, consisting of two small streets inhabited by French refugees from Europe and the American colonies. 
The greater part of the houses are of brick and in the Dutch fashion, but are only one story high, it not being possible to give them much foundation, owing to the soil being sandy and the springs lying within three feet of the level. 
The commerce of this small island is very considerable, especially in time of peace, and it may be considered as the emporium of the contraband trade of the English, French, Dutch, and Spanish ; and, in the time of war, the privateers come in hither to sell their prizes. Every day many vessels leave this island for the carry-   ing on a traffic with the coasts of Tierra Firme, and return with great quantities of money, and with productions of much value; so that the town is very rich and well provided with all necessaries. 
This island belonged formerly to a Danish company, but produced nothing until it was sold to the king, who made it a port of free commerce to all nations. In 1688 the factory was attacked and plundered by the Flibustiers ; after which a battery was constructed in the interior of the port, mounting 20 cannons. [The island of St. Thomas, with most of the smaller islands in the West Indies, has fallen into the hands of the British in the present war. It has been said, by our author, that its trade is important : the following documents will verify his assertion.  in

[==[[Thomastown|THOMASTOWN]]==, a posttown of the Dis-  trict of Maine, Lincoln County, on the w. side of Penobscot Bay, and about four leagues from Franklin Island, at the mouth of the river St. George, which divides this town from Warren and Gushing, to the w. A considerable river in the s. e. part of the township is called Wessowessgeeg. From the hill of Madambettocks may be seen islands and lands to a great distance • and near it there is thought to be plenty of iron ore ; but no attempts have been made to ascertain its quality. The grand staples of Thomastown are lime and lumber. Limestone is very common, and spots of land, or rather rock, of six rods square, are frequently sold for 100 dollars. There are now about 35 kilns erected, each of which, on an average, will produce 200 fifty gallon casks. These kilns, if burned only three times a year, (though many are five or six times) will furnish about 21,000 casks ; which net, after all expenses, about six shillings a cask. Too much attention being paid to this business, prevents a due cultivation of the lands. In 1792,      there were owned on the river 12 brigs, schooners, and sloops, equal to about 1100 tons, employed in foreign and coasting voyages. On the river, and its several streams, are a number of tide and other grist and saw mills, which afford great profit to their owners. A fort with a number of cannon, and a regular garrison of provincials, was formerly stationed about five miles below the head of the tide. Few vestiges of the fort now remain ; but in place of it an elegant building was erected in 1794, by the Hon. Henry Knox, Esq. The settlement of Thomastown began about 1720, in 1777 it was incorporated, in 1790 it contained 801 inhabitants ; and it was computed to contain in 1796 above 1200. There are here no public schools constantly kept, though there are several private ones throughout the year. There are two churches, the one for Baptists, who are the most numerous, and the other for Congregationalists. Here is also a social library. The compact part of the town is seven miles s. of Camden, seven e. of Warren, 32 n. e. of Wiscasset.]

It has also a convent of the title of San Juan de Dios, which is an hospital, and was founded by the governor D. Juan de Dios Valde. It is of a hot temperature, and very unhealthy from the damps arising from the stagnant waters, left  by the floodings of the Orinoco ; and it would be very scant in provisions, but for the zeal and attention of the Catalonian Capuchin missionaries. The English pirate (for so the Spaniards call Mm), Walter Raleigh, sacked it in 1618, and, after this, two redoubts were rebuilt for its defence, although they are now in a state of ruin, and in their stead Charles III. ordered a fort to be built at the mouth of the channel formed by the river, and which they call De Limones. [The governor's salary is 3000 piastres fortes, but he is subject to the captainshipgeneral of Caracas : 244 miles w. of the mouth of the river Orinoco^ in lat. 8° T n. and long. 63° 55' w.~\ Thome, S. another city.

[TIERRA AUSTRAL DEL ESPIRITU ==[[Santo|SANTO]]==, called by Bougainville, The Archipelago of the Great Cyclades, and by Captain Cook, The New Hebrides, may be considered as the e. extremity of the vast Archipelago of Nueva Guayana. The islands are situate between lat. 14° 29' and 20° 14' s. and between long. 166° and 170° 21' e. from Greenwich ; and consist of the following islands, some of which have received names from the different European navigators, and others retain the names which they bear among the natives; viz. Tierra Austral del Espiritu Santo, St. Bartholomew, Mallicollo, Pic de l'Etoile, Aurora, Isle of Lepers, Whitsuntide, Ambrym, Paoon, Shepherds Isles, Sandwich, Erromango, Immer, Tana, Erronan, Annetom, Apee, Three Hills, Montagu, Hinchinbrook, and Erromanga. Quiros, who first discovered these islands, in 1606, describes them, as " richer and more fertile than Spain, and as populous as they are fertile; watered with fine rivers, and producing silver, pearls, nutmegs, mace, pepper, ginger, ebony of the first quality, wood for the construction of vessels, and plants which might be fabricated into sailcloth and cordages, one sort of 

VOL. IV.    which is not unlike the hemp of Europe." The inhabitants of these islands, he describes as of several different races of men ; black, white, mulatto, tawny, and coppercoloured ; a proof, he supposes, of their intercourse with various people. They use no firearms, are employed in no mines, nor have they any of those means of destruction which the genius of Europe has invented. Industry and policy seem to have made but little progress among them : they build neither towns nor fortresses; acknowledge neither king nor laws, and are divided only into tribes, among which there does not always subsist a perfect harmony. Their arms are the bow and arrows, the spear and the dart, all made of wood. Their only covering is a garment round the waist, which reaches to the middle of the thigh. They are cleanly, of a lively and grateful disposition, capable of friendship and instruction. Their houses are of wood, covered with palmleaves. They have places of worship and burial. They work in stone, and polish marble, of which there are many quarries. They make flutes, drums, wooden spoons, and from the motherofpearl, form chissels, scissars, knives, hooks, saws, hatchets, and small round plates for necklaces. Their canoes are well built and neatly finished. Hogs, goats, cows, buffaloes, and various fowls and fish, for food, are found in abundance on and about these islands. Added to all these and many other excellencies, these islands are represented as having a remarkably salubrious air, which is evinced by the healthy robust appearance of the inhabitants, who live to a great age, and yet have no other bed than the earth. 
Such is the description which Quiros gives of these islands, in and about which he spent some months, and which he represents to the King of Spain as " the most delicious country in the world ; the garden of Eden, the inexhaustible source of glory, riches, and power to Spain." — On the n. side of the largest of these islands, called Espiritu Santo, is a bay, called San Felipe and Sant-Yago, which, says Quiros, " penetrates 20 leagues into the country ; the inner part is all safe, and may be entered with security, by night as well as by day. On every side, in its vicinity, many villages may be distinguished, and if we ma y j ud g' e by the smoke which rises by day, and the fires that are seen by night, there are many more in the interior parts." The harbour in this bay was named by Quiros, La Vera Cruz, and is a part of this bay, and large enough to admit 1000 vessels. The anchorage is on an excellent bottom of black sand, in water of different]

TIERRA ==[[Firme|FIRME]]==, a kingdom of S. America ; bounded e. by the province and government of Cartagena, from which it is divided by the river S. Juan, w. by the province of Costarica in the kingdom of Guatemala, and n. and s. by the two seas, at the Isthmus of Panama, or Tierra Firme. It is 146 leagues long, 90 wide in the broadest part, and eight at the narrowest, and at the aforesaid isthmus, the which is the most celebrated of any ever heard of. This kingdom is divided into three provinces, which are those of Darien, Veragua, Panama or Tierra Firme ; which, united, give the whole the latter name. It is of a hot and moist temperature, though the nights are fresh and agreeable^ for from five o'clock in the evening the wind from the sea springs up. 
It is watered by an infinite number of rivers, the most considerable of which are, the Chagre, Bayano, Atrato, Tiura, some of which enter the N. and others the S. Sea. The territory is for the most part mountainous and craggy, and almost inaccessible, owing to the great cordillera which intersects it ; not but that it has some fertile, though little cultivated llanuras ; the natives being rather dedicated to the commerce with the provinces of Peru and with Europe, as, in the time of the galleons, they lay in the very way for such a trade. They, consequently, only cultivate such maize as may be necessary for the subsistence of the Negroes and the great herds of cattle which they breed, and of the flesh of which they make, by drying it in the sun, salted meat in strips of three fingers wide, which they call iasajo, and which is also the common food. 
Here are some gold mines, particularly in the province of Darien, the same which were formerly worked with great success, but which are now abandoned through the incursions of those Indians ; and there are now no other mines worked but some in the province of Veragua, which are of very good alloy. In the mountains are found an infinity of strange birds and animals, the former of great beauty and delightful note ; and, amongst the latter, many which have excited the particular attention of the naturalist. Amongst others is a species of the sloth, thus called from the difficulty with which it moves, inasmuch as he is whole hours in proceeding only a few steps. This animal is of the shape of a cat, and utters lamentable groans upon moving either his fore or hind feet, and it is said that he does so from the great pain occasioned by the exertion. —  
Amongst the birds, the king of the fowls deserves attention, as being rare and of exceeding beauty, with wings of different colours, and of the size of a moderate sized turkeycock. Should there happen to be any animal killed near the spot where this kingbird is setting, the other birds, although they may be assembled around in vast numbers, never presume to touch the prey until the king shall have first darted upon it. He generally satiates himself with the eyes and the heart; and his retiring is the signal for the rest to begin their feast. 
In the province of Veragua are some smal 1 monkeys of a yellow colour, and with a white crown, with a skin as fine as the best silk. They are extremely gentle, but so delicate, that they invariably die upon being removed from their native place ; for, although every precaution to bring them to Europe has been adopted, they have all been unsuccessful. In this kingdom are abundance of insects, snakes of many kinds, spiders, centipedes, mosquitoes, and various others, which are troublesome in the extreme. 
There are several very good ports on the coasts of both seas, serving as asylums for the illicit traders, the commerce of this kingdom having greatly diminished since the establishment of that of Buenos Ayres. It has therefore become much less opulent than formerly, since then all the trade which was done by Peru and Guatemala with Spain, and vice versa, passed through Tierra Firme, and was shipped and landed at Portobello. The population is not proportionate to its size. — See an account of the same under the article of each of the three provinces composing this kingdom. The capital is the city of Panama. 
Tierra Firme, one of the provinces of the above kingdom, and from whence the kingdom had its name. It lies between the province of Darien to the e. and that of Veragua to the w. is 55 leagues long from the jurisdiction of the alcaldiamayor of Nata, by a line which runs from the isle of Veragua in the N. Sea, as far as the settlement and isle ofGuarare in the S. Sea, and, on the opposite part, by another line, which runs from the great strand on the n. coast of the province of Darien to the Port Quemado in the S. Sea. In this province the isthmus, dividing the two seas, is the narrowest, being only eight leagues across; although, from the roughness of the mountains and from the abundance of the waters of the rivers, it is necessary to pass across by a ciixuitous rout of no less than 16 leagues.  This province is very fertile, and would, if cultivated, produce great profit ; has large estates, in which are bred much cattle, and some mills in which sugar and brandy are made. The common people use guarapo for their drink, which is a fermentation of plantations, and the consumption of this is very great. The Indians who have remained here are now very few indeed, and the greater part of the inhabitants are slaves, and freemen, Mulattoes, and The capital is also that of the kingdom other settlements are,

Thus it is that in the many estates here, they gather in abundance seeds, flowers, and fruits, and bread much cattle ; and in the woods are found wild rabbits and pigeons.    T I X 
The Indians assert that the first Inca of Peru came from this island, his name being Manco Capac ; and with him his sister and wife Mama Olio Huacu, making the Indians believe that they were born of the Sun, and that they were sent to them to instruct them in the manners of civilized life ; and here, as in a sacred place, did they build the celebrated Temple to the Sun, covered all over with gold, and certainly the most magnificent of any temple in that kingdom.

It is bounded by the provinces of Mexico and Goaxaca. It is for the most part fertile and of good temperature, abounding in fruit, herbs, birds, and animals of the chase, and covered with cultivated estates and ranchos, wherein many head of cattle are bred. This province is crossed by the great sierra of its name, which, in that idiom, signifies house of bread; and it vies in height with the most lofty sierra of that kingdom, and is constantly covered with snow. Before the arrival of the Spaniards the inhabitants of this province were in the grossest state of idolatry, and many are the remains of idols and altars found in different caverns and recesses ; it being also believed that in the same sierra the caziques have deposited great treasures, with the view of returning to take possession of them. This province was in those times very populous, and a republic, governed by a tribunal ; and its natives were so valorous that they lived by force of arms, maintaining themselves independent of the Mexican emperors ; these never having been able to subdue them. 
The Spaniards, on their entrance, found their way disputed by the Tlaxcaltecas, and with these they had several conflicts ; but the same people who had been such bitter enemies, afterwards proved themselves the most faithful allies to the Spaniards, and it was altogether owing to the assistance they gave by their exertion and cunning, that this chief succeeded at length in the  

TLA  conquest of Nueva Espaila. These Indians have in consequence, and very justly, maintained many privileges, the one of which is their indemnification from all tribute, save a very trifling one, which is a mere acknowledgment of their vassalage : their numbers is so considerable as to amount to 11,000 families. Its population consists of several wards and estates. 
Tlaxcala, the capital, is the city of the same name, founded by the emperor Chichi meco. It was formerly very populous and rich, and pleasantly situate on the shore of a river which runs into the S. Sea; and is now chiefly inhabited by Indians, who, as they pay no tribute, are very rich, and have some good churches and convents. The author Thomas Gage, asserts, that at his time the jurisdiction of this city consisted of 28 towns and settlements, containing 150,000 families. — Heylin says, that, upon the arrival of the Spaniards it contained 300,000 inhabitants, and Fa ther Acosta asserts, that it had a marketplace in which 30,000 persons might assemble, and that in the shambles there were scarcely ever less than 1500 sheep, and 4000 cows ; but the case was very different in the time of Gemeli, who was here in 1698 ; for he asserts, that the city was but of a moderate size, with one parish church, in which there was a picture of the ship in which Hernan Cortes arrived at Vera Cruz. — [Humboldt asserts its present population to amount to 3400 souls, among whom there are not more than 900 Indians of pure extraction.] 
In this city was the senate, or tribunal, which, according to defined laws, governed the republic, and one of the members of the same, whose talents have rendered him the most memorable, was Xicontencal and Magistcatzin. It has a convent of the religious of S. Francisco; and the aforesaid parish church was erected into a cathedral and bishopric in 1526, and remained so until 1550, when it was translated to La Puebla de los Angeles. This city is inhabited by 500 families of Spaniards, Mustecs, and Mulattoes, who, for the most part, are employed in the manufacture of cloths, baizes, mantles, and other cotton articles, the same being the principal branches of its commerce.

Its length is about 26 miles, but its breadth only about six, and its circumference about 70 miles. The climate is not so hot as might be expected so near the equator ; and it is said, that it lies out of the course of those hurricanes that have sometimes   T O B proved so fatal to the other W. India islands. It has a fruitful soil, capable of producing sugar, and indeed every thing else that is raised in the W. India islands, with the addition (if we may believe the Dutch) of the cinnamon, nutmeg, and gum copal. It is well watered with numerous springs, and its bays and rivers are so disposed as to be very commodious for all kinds of shipping. The value and importance of this island appears from the extensive and formidable armaments sent thither in support of their different claims. It seems to have been chiefly possessed by the Dutch, who defended their pretensions against both England and France with the most obstinate perseverance. By the Treaty of Aix la Chapelle, in 1748, it was declared neutral ;    though, by the treaty of 1763, it was yielded up to Great Britain; but in June, 1781, it was taken bv the French, and ceded to them by the treaty of 1783 : and captured by the British in 1793, in whose hands it still remains. In the report of the privy council on the Slave Trade, in 1788, the British property vested here is estimated at 28,000 taxed acres of patented estates ; and the Negroes are computed at 14,883, at £.50 each Negro.

==[[Toca|TOCA]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Tunja in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada : it is of r a cold but healthy temperature ; situate in a* 1 very beautiful llanura, and abounding in barley, maize, papas, and other productions of its climate. It has large breeds of cattle ; and of the wools of these they make, besides the commoner manufactures of blankets and rugs, shirts, hats, serges, and baizes. It contains about 100 housekeepers, and as many Indians : in the time of the gentilism of the latter it was a large and rich city, and the court of the Fourth Elector of the Zaque, or King of Tunja; but nothing of its ancient grandeur has remained : two leagues and a half s. from Tunja. 
==[[Tocabela|TOCABELA]]==, a settlement of the head settlement of the district Teotalzingo and alcaldia mayor of Villalta in Nueva Espaiia. It contains 19 families of Indians, and is 20 leagues from its capital. 
==[[Tocachi|TOCACHI]]==, a settlement of the province and kingdom of Quito, in the district of the corregimiento of Las Cinco Leguas de la Capital, to the e. of the settlement of Malchingui, and to the w. of the settlement of Cayambe. It is situate in a pleasant plain, surrounded with fertile hills, but of a somewhat cold temperature. It is watered by a small river of its name, which runs s, and enter* the Pisque : in lat. 3' n. 
==[[Tocaima|TOCAIMA|Tocayma]]==, a city of the government of Mariquita in the new kingdom of Granada ; founded by Hernando Venegas Carrillo de Manosalbas in 1544, near the river Pati, which is the same which, higher up, is called ,Bogola, and enters the Magdalena very near   this city. It is of an extremely hot temperature, and situate in the midst of a small mountain covered with brambles, which it is necessary to cut down every six months. It suffers from drought, the river being at some distance, and as the water of a pit which is near, is ill tasted and never drank, although it affords advantageous bathing to such as are afflicted with the itch. Besides the inconvenience of the heat, its inhabitants are afflicted with the shingles, which they call carate, and which produces a very frightful appearance ; also with cotos, or swellings in the throat, and buboes. It is much infested by venomous creatures, such as spiders, snakes of various kinds, vipers, tayas, corales, rattlesnakes, and mosquitoes, ticks, and other insects, and above all by the coy a, which, although it does not sting, is of so venomous a nature, that if it be crushed so that its blood touch the skin of any one, it immediately causes death with violent struggles. [This account is, however, known to be fabulous.] The woods abound in exquisite sorts of timber, cedars, walnuts, pomegranates, tamarinds, buos, and guayacanes of two sorts, which are often found petrified. It produces also much cocoa and tobacco, which is too strong to be smoked ; an infinite variety of sugarcanes, of which they make many sweets and sugar ; also maize, yucas, plantains, potatoes, yams, and a great quantity of other fruits. It abounds no less in fish in the rivers of Bogota and Fusagasuga, and in these there are likewise many alligators. Here grow some pineapples, the seeds of which serve as cathartics and emetics. The inhabitants, who amount to about 700, are very poor and weak, and much addicted to idleness, though they take the trouble of breeding some swine, which they carry for sale, by the river, to Honda, and alive, by land, to Santa Fe. In the district of this city are found mines of the finest copper, which are not worked, and of loadstone ; and formerly there were some of gold, so rich, that they say here, that there was a certain inhabitant, called Juan Diaz Xaramillo, who became so wealthy as to measure his riches by the peck, and that he built a palace of such magnificence, that he brought from Spain, at immense cost, the window frames, the balconies, the tiles for the roof, and all other things necessary for its ornament. But this edifice %vas destroyed, (in punishment, as they say, of a dreadful blasphemy which its master had uttered,) together with the citv, from the river having overflowed its bed in 1673, and at a considerable distance from the    

TOO  spot where the town stood there was found floating' upon a plank an image of Jacinthus, which had belonged to the town, and which is now preserved in the convent of the Franciscans, which building was raised upon the ruins of the palace above mentioned ; the new city being built upon the top of the mountain, at the skirts of which runs the said river. The city is small, and of little commerce; it has a good parish church. It is in the ancient province of Los Panches ; [56 miles s. w. of Santa Fe, and 58 s. of Mariquita, in the high road leading down to Honda, Mariquita, Neiva, and Popayan, in lat. 4° 16' n. and long. 74° 59' aj.]

==[[Tocancipa|TOCANCIPA]]==, a settlement of the province and corregimiento of Zipaquira in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada. It is situate in a llanura, of a mild and healthy temperature, produces plenty of wheat, maize, and papas, and manufactures pitchers, jars, and other articles of earthenware, which are carried for sale to Santa Fe and other parts. The number of white inhabitants is so small, as scarcely to amount to 20 ; but the Indians exceed 200 : seven leagues n. of Santa Fe, in the high road leading to Tunja. 
==[[Tocancipaes|TOCANCIPAES]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, descendants of the Guatavitas.

They are furious and irreconcileable enemies of the Portuguese,  from  whom they have retired, flying to the mountains and woods to the s. They are verj numerous. Tocantines, the aforesaid river, which takes its name from the above nation, is large and irrigates are fertile and  copious : the lands it pleasant ; and the Portuguese have made different excursions through them. This river, after having run many leagues in a n. direction, and collected the waters of the Araguaya, enters the river Para (which is an arm of the Maranon, or Amazon) by the s. side : [in lat. 1° 45' s.] 

==[[Tocarema|TOCAREMA]]==, a settlement of the jurisdiction of Tocaima and government of Mariquita in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada.

It is of a hot temperature, abounding in sugarcanes, maize, yucas, and plantains, and is annexed to the curacy of the settlement of Anolaima. It is celebrated for two battles fought near it, between the Spaniards commanded by Gonzalo Ximinez de Quesada, aided by the Moscas Indians, and the Panches, commanded by Zaquizazipa, the last king of Tunja, in 1538 ; in the first of which engagements the latter were victorious, though in the second they were completely routed by the Spaniards. It is ten leagues from Santa Fe.

[==[[Tocaya|TOCAYA]]==, the principal village of Minas Novas, in the province and government of Rio de Janeyro, in Brazil. It is 35 leagues distant from Tejuco, in a n. e. direction. The road thither is parallel with the river Jigitonhonha, which runs from two to five leagues w. of it. On this road there are numerous farmhouses, which afford sufficient accommodation for a traveller to pass a night : they in general belong to persons resident in Tejuco, where their produce is sold. Numerous rivulets flow into the Jigi-] 4 r. 2  T O C  [tonhonha in this direction, in some of which are found white topazes, more commonly known here by the name of minus novas : they are pretty pellucid pebbles, generally rounded, though sometimes they occur perfectly crystallized, in the same form as the yellow topaz. Blue topazes and aguamarinas are also found here ; some of the former are of a singular variety, being in one part blue, and in the other clear and pellucid. This neighbourhood is also noted for producing the beautiful chrysoberyl, which is much esteemed by the higher orders of society in Brazil, and in great request among the jewellers of Rio de Janeiro. These gems rarely occur crystallized ; they sell at considerable prices in their rough state, and are much more valued in America than in England, where, indeed, they are little known, or they would be more highly appreciated, being, when polished, of great brilliancy and very beautiful. 
To the w. of the river Jigitonhonha, and opposite the village of Bom Successo, is the Cerro of Sant Antonio, a place much famed for diamonds, which are said to be of an indifferent quality. There are also other parts, well known to many of the inhabitants of the district as being rich in these treasures. 
The country is very fertile, and produces a great variety of the finest woods for cabinetworks ; also numerous fruits, and most exquisite vaynilla, which grows spontaneously. The land, being less elevated than Cerro do Frio, is said to be much warmer, and is highly favourable to the growth of sugar and coffee. The plantations are chiefly of cotton, which is reputed to be equal in colour and quality to that of Pernambuco. 
Minas Novas is under the jurisdiction of the Ouvidor of Villa do Principe, who goes thither once a year to settle disputes, administer justice, and discharge other duties belonging to his office. 
At Tocaya the Jigitonhonha flows into a larger river, called Rio Grande, which, taking an e. direction, enters the sea in lat. 16° 20' s. near Porto Seguro. The current to the sea is very rapid, and the navigation ftom Tocaya is performed in six days. It cannot be too much recommended to the government of Brazil, immediately to order a survey of this river, which might be performed in one of their launches in two months at little or no expense, avid were it found necessary, a chain of connection might be established from its mouth to Tocaya. 
The population of Minas Novas is thin, compared with its extent, but is daily increasing. It   does not appear that mining is the object which attracts settlers, though there is a considerable quantity of stones exported, which are found only here, as has been before observed. 
Where the rivers are deep it is very difficult to raise the cascalhao from their beds, in order to wash it for gold, &c; for this purpose various trivial and ineffectual methods are practised : it would be highly conducive to the interest of the proprietor, as well as of the state, to have rafts or boats constructed, and to adopt the machinery used by the ballastheavers on the river Thames, by means of which the cascalhao might be raised, even from a depth of twenty feet, however rapid were the current. This machinery is highly to be recommended, not only in this district, but throughout the mining country. Were a model of it made by order of government, and the requisite ironwork prepared in Rio de Janeiro (if necessary), and admitted into the mining country, free of duty, there would probably be such an increase of gold obtained by it, that the proportionate augmentation of the royal fifths would amply repay the expense of introducing the improvement.

==[[Tocuyo|TOCUYO]]==, a town of the province and government of Venezuela in the new kingdom of Granada ; situate between two mountains in the valley of this name, and on the shore of a river near the seacoast, by the point of Chiburiche. [Its atmosphere is cloudy, and its climate, though rather cold, is wholesome. It has a convent of Franciscans, and another of Dominicans. It is governed by a cabildo. The soil is adapted to every sort of production, and the wheat is reckoned the best of the province. From eight to ten thousand quintals are annually exported to Baraquisimeto, Guanou, San Philipi, and Caracas. The inhabitants manufacture here blankets and other clothes, and they have a tannery; but their lucrative trade is in salt, which they procure from the saltpits of Coro. The population is computed at 10,200 souls. Suicide is remarkably common amongst them. Tocuyo is  58J  183 miles w. s. w. of Caraccas, and 58 n. n. e. of Truxillo, in lat. 9° 25' s. and long. 69° 51' w.~]

It fertilizes the neighbouring country, the soil of which is naturally good, and it also affords means of transporting produce ; but the indolence of the Spaniards is so great, that none of the adjoining lands are cultivated.] 
Tocuyo, another settlement, in the province of Barcelona and government of C.umane, situate on the coast, to the w. of the river Unare. 

TODOS ==[[Santos|SANTOS]]==, a large, handsome, and convenient bay of the province and captainship of the same name, or San Salvador, in the kingdom of Brazil. It is 37 miles long from n. to 5. ; its greatest width from e. to w. 27 miles, and its circumference is 36. Its entrance is about eight miles from the point of Tagapipe to that of San Antonio, its two extremities. In it are many bays for careening vessels, and many fertile islands, but on the w. side are two shoals laying on the left as you enter, which are, however, not dangerous, since, there being so large a distance between the two aforesaid points, a sufficient chasm is left for the passage of vessels. Several rivers enter this bay ; the principal of which are six, called the Paraguasu, Serzipe, Jaguaripe, Matuim, Paranamerin, and Piraja. The first who discovered this bay was Christoval Jacques, and it began to be peopled by Francisco Pereira Cowtino, by order of King Don Juan III. of Portugal, he taking with him from that kingdom several persons of distinction for the purpose ; but these were all obliged to retire upon an insurrection of the Topinambes Indians, and again returning to their settlement, they had the misfortune to encounter shipwreck on the coast of Itaparica, where they all perished by the hands of the infidels ; on which account the right and proprietorship of the settlers fell upon the crown, who commanded it to be repeopled, and declared it the capital of the state of Brazil ; as such there leaves it yearly a fleet, besides many other vessels bound for Lisbon, laden with gold, diamonds, topazes, sugar, tobacco, and other productions of immense profit. The Dutch gained possession of it in 1623, it    
■  
582 T O D O S having then belonged to the crown of Spain, as well as the kingdom of Portugal itself, through the inheritance of Philip II. ; but which was recovered the following year, 1624, by a powerful armament under the command of Don Fredrique of Toledo. 
[A description of this bay has been already given by Alcedo, under article Santos. We have not thought right to suppress this account, it being, although containing some repetition, perhaps the better one of the two. We shall take this advantage of adding some particulars not contained in either, which we have collected subsequently to the publication of the former article, and which will not, we believe, be unimportant. 
Some useful observations were made several years ago, respecting the different kinds of timber employed at this bay for shipbuilding, by Colonels de Brito and Weinholtz. The following table, drawn up by them, shows the gravity of a cubic foot of each, and to what purposes they may be most advantageously appropriated. lb. oz.

These are only a very few of the trees which might be advantageously employed, not only in the construction of ships and houses, but for various other purposes; and it ismuch to be lamented that so many of the valuable productions of this country are still unknown to botanists. On account of the difficulty of transporting timber, many large woods in the interior of the country are burnt down by the inhabitants, in order that they may form plantations of maize and manioc ;  

SANTOS. and, like the backsettlers in North America, they forsake these plantations in a few years, and proceeding still farther into the interior, continue to reduce the woods in the same manner, by which means a vast number of trees is destroyed that might be converted to purposes of utility. 
The surrounding country is in generafwell cultivated, and abounds with many large plantations, the owners of which employ from two to three hundred slaves, with a proportionate number of horses in their sugar works. Many of these planters have realized large fortunes, and built for themselves elegant mansions, with chapels adjoining. Here they reside with their families, except during the rainy season, when they repair to the city, San Salvador. 
The natural productions and animals in the province of Todos Santos are similar to those in the other captainships. Nitre (nitrum nativum) is found in great abundance towards the s. w. of the province ; it is said to be of the best quality, and, if properly attended to, might furnish a profitable article of commerce. In Caxeira, another district of Todos Santos, apiece of native copper, weighing 2666 pounds, was found several years ago. It was transmitted to the Royal Museum at Lisbon, and far exceeds in size the specimens contained in any other European cabinet. From Bahia there was also brought, nearly about the same period, a specimen of globular iron mineral, ( Mineraferri subaquosa globosa, Wall-Min.) with balls of various sizes, from two lines to half an inch. From this mine, besides the iron, ready formed balls for muskets and ordnance might be extracted. 
In this province there are several little trading tow ns besides the capital ; the chief of these are Jagoaripe, Amor Jacobina, Do Sitio, St. Francisco, and Cachoeira. The last of these places is pleasantly situated on the banks of a small river, about fourteen leagues from Bahai. It is here that the produce of the gold mines of the north centres, and for the space of about ninety leagues round the country, is highly cultivated and planted with tobacco. Though most of the captainships furnish a small quantity of this plant, it is in the province of Bahia alone that it is become of consequence as an article of commerce. 
About forty years ago the stagnation of the exportation of tobacco, on account of the enormous duties imposed upon it in Portugal, was severely felt in this province, when the government found it necessary to lighten them, on which this trade recovered its former vigour. Besides]   TODOS SANTOS.  [that, which, previous to the recent changes, used to be exported to the mothercountry ; a considerable quantity of inferior tobacco is annually sent to the African coast, for which they receive various articles in return. 
Tobacco, Brazil wood, and the produce of the gold and diamond mines were wholly monopolized by the crown ; and from the probable estimates given by different writers on the subject of Portuguese finance, the revenue they derived from these articles was very considerable. So carefully, however, was this subject guarded from all inquiry, that it was impossible to attain a knowledge of the exact amount. 
Though the trade of Todos Santos is not equal to that of Rio de Janeiro, it is nevertheless considerable; which, however, is rather imputable to its local advantages than to the industry of the inhabitants. Before the irruption of the French into Portugal, its principal trade was carried on directly with Lisbon and Oporto. Above fiftylarge vessels were employed in this trade, which supplied the colony with European manufactures, as well as various other commodities, such as wine, flour, butter, cheese, &c. In return they were freighted with tobacco, lignum vita?, mahogany, and various other woods, both for useful and ornamental works ; coffee, sugar, cotton, a variety of medicinal roots, gums, and balsams, dyeing woods, and an ardent spirit distilled from the juice of the cane mixed with molasses, but different in flavour from rum. The shops in Rio de Janeyro are filled with Manchester fabrics of different kinds ; several of these are likewise to be found at St. Salvador; but the printed cottons most commonly in use here are extremely coarse, and and chiefly of Lisbon manufacture. 
The colonial trade of Todos Santos is also very considerable. A great number of vessels of about two hundred and fifty tons burden are employed in it. They are loaded at Bahia with rum, sugar, earthenware, British, and German goods, salt, &c. These cargoes are mostly disposed of in a contraband traffic with the Spaniards of Maldonado and Montevideo, and for which they are paid in silver. They bring home with them salt beef and hides. The beef, on their return, is sold by retail at about two vintims a pound to the poorer class of the inhabitants, as well as for the use of the slaves, and for victualling the shipping. 
The inland trade, notwithstanding the indolence of the colonists, is also very considerable. Near a thousand launches, as Alcedo observes, and other small craft, are constantly arriving in  the bay with the various productions of the interior of their own and the adjoining captainships. These chiefly consist of tobacco, cotton, and drugs of various kinds, from Cachoiera, rum and oil from Itaporica, wood of different kinds from the province of Ilheos, salt fish from Porto Seguro ; cotton, maize, sugar, firewood, &c. from the adjacent woods and rivers ; and vegetables from the more immediate confines of thebay. 
The cotton, which here forms an important staple of trade, after being landed, is deposited in a warehouse appropriated to the purpose, where it is sorted, weighed, and made up into bales for exportation. The different qualities are marked on the outside of these packages ; and they remain in the warehouse till they are disposed of. 
Foreigners of all nations were expressly prohibited from any kind of participation in the trade of Brazil : they were not even allowed to ship colonial produce in Portuguese bottoms. Such unjust and impolitic restrictions and monopolies, while they deadened industry, and shackled the fair trader, opened a wide field for smuggling. Hence a great quantity of British commodities were poured into Bahia and the other parts of Brazil by the Lisbon traders ; which even the severe laws, inflicting a heavy fine upon the captain engaged in such trade, and transportation to Africa for three years, could not wholly prevent. 
Notwithstanding the large quantity of specie in circulation, a great part of their commerce is conducted by barter. The people of Todos Santos are accused by some writers of practising a mean and knavish cunning in their mercantile dealings, especially with strangers, from whom ? it is affirmed, they frequently ask double the price they will take ; while, on the other hand, they endeavour to undervalue, by every artifice in their power, the articles offered to them in exchange. In a word, they are represented as being, with a few exceptions, wholly devoid of the feelings of honour, and destitute of that common sense of rectitude which ought to regulate every transaction between man and man. 
Except tanning of leather, manufactures of every kind were expressly prohibited ; and so strictly was this absurd law enforced, that a few years ago a cottonspinner, who lately attempted to establish one near St. Salvador, was sent to Europe, and his machinery destroyed. 
The coast round Todos Santos abounds with whales ; only a few large boats are, however, employed in this fishery; and the oil procured]   584    
[from those which are thus caught is by no means equal to the consumption ; consequently it bears a high price. 
The military establishment in this province is on the same footingas in Rio de Janeyro, and the other captainships of Brazil. The government is particularly strict, especially in St. Salvador and the other cities, in having all the young men enrolled either to serve in the regulars or in the militia. No rank, however high, is deemed sufficient to exempt them • even the Portuguese, as soon as they land, are liable to the same law while they remain in the colony, though they may be already enrolled to serve in the mothercountry. Being a member of the holy office does not even appear to afford a sufficient protection. The capital of the bay and captainship of Todos Santos is San Salvador, which see.

TOPlA, Sierra de, a cordillera of very high mountains in Nueva Espana. It runs from n. to s. more than 150 leagues from New Mexico to the city of Guadalaxara, and is more than thirty broad. Its elevation is such as to be comparable only witli the sidrra of the Andes in Peru, and in it are to be seen many chasms which cannot be looked at without horror. The whole of this sierra is covered with pines of an amazing height and bulk, and so thick as to be impenetrable to the rays of the sun. It enjoys different temperatures, for in its higher parts the cold is intolerable, getting more mild in proportion as you descend the skirts of the mountains. From the same heights fall down many rivers, which, united, run towards the w. and enter the S. Sea, others falling by the e. into the N. Sea. These rivers become amazingly swelled at the melting of the snows on the sierra, where it often lays, upwards of a month, more than two yards deep. The largest of these rivers are the Nasas, the Papasquiaro, and the Ahorcados, the which form a great lake. The rains fall here continually from the month of June to September, and then they exhibit a grand and alarming  sight, for they spread themselves with excessive rapidity over a space of two or three leagues, causing a distressing inundation, to which is added the plague of an intolerable number of mosquitoes. 
There are several trees in its woods producing wild fruit, and there are breeds of guacamayas, very beautiful through their varicoloured plumage ; carpenterbirds, who are fond of boring holes in the firs, in which they deposit their food 90 as to prevent it from corrupting ; and it is curious to observe what extreme pains are required by any one to dislodge it from its place of security. Here also are great flocks of peahens, besides a multitude of other birds, with some royal eagles. No less are there found some wild beasts, such as bears, lions, and tigers, which with difficulty are killed by the Indians for their hides,with which to adorn themselves ; and besides these, there are a great variety of squirrels. 
This sierra has some very rich silvermines, which at first yielded at the average of one mark of silver for every quintal of earth. It Avas this, indeed, that allured the Spaniards to enter these terrific wilds, and it is pretty certain, that no other inducement could have had any effect, for, according to all that have seen them, their horrors are such as to beggar all description. They were nevertheless inhabited by several barbarous nations of Indians, the principal of which is that of the name of the sierra itself, amongst whom the Jesuits entered in the year 1590, with a view of bringing them within the pale of the church. The chief of these missionaries was the father Andres de Tapia, who succeeded in converting many, and reducing them to a civilized settlement ; and it was by such means that the Spaniards first began to establish themselves, and to work the mines, the which have been subsequently abandoned through the excessive cost of carrying materials to so great a distance. So great was the spiritual fruit that rewarded the labours of the missionaries, that in the year 1640, they had converted more than 50,000 souls, according to father Andres de Rivas, who dwelt there for many years, and wrote the history of the country.

The greater part of them have now retired into the mountains and woods towards the s. very few remaining in the Portuguese territory. They were formerly very warlike, and laid down the law to other nations. 
[These Indians are of a moderate stature, and of a lighter complexion than their more northern neighbours, who are not, however, so dark as the African negroes under the same degree of latitude. The Topinambis resemble them in their flat noses, which being esteemed a beauty, are produced by art, during infancy. The hair of their head, which is black, isTong and lank ; but, like the Tapuyers, they have no hair on their faces or any part of the body.]

Nicholas, 70 miles n. of Little Gonave, and 65 e. of the island of Cuba. It is surrounded by rocks on the n. and w. side, and the bottom on the e. is not only difficult to find, but dangerous through shoals of rock and sands, a circumstance which probably first led the said pirates to seek the island as a place of refuge. Notwithstanding this, their establishments were taken and destroyed by the Spaniards in 1638 ; but they afterwards returned    TOR to recover it, and established themselves again under Captain Wallis, an Englishman. The latter was obliged shortly to abandon it to the French, and these were persecuted for many years by the Spaniards, till at last they were obliged to retreat. So unremitting, however, did they continue in their pretensions to recover it, that they made one last effort, and, with the assistance of the inhabitants of the other islands, and being joined by the pirates of all nations, they succeeded in making a settlement in Tortuga, and began to erect some towns and forts on the coast to the n. of St. Domingo. [This last possession by the French was effected in 1676.] Tortuga is 60 miles in circumference, and only five miles and a half distant from St. Domingo. It has many shoals, especially towards the n. but is very fertile and abundant in tobacco, palms, sandal wood, guayacan, resin, China root, aloes, sugar, indigo, cotton, ginger, oranges, lemons, apricots, bananas, and many other fruits peculiar to the W. Indies, such as certain pease, yucas, Sec; but it is very scarce of water, so that the inhabitants are obliged to catch the rainwater in cisterns. It abounds greatly in wild boars, the hunting of which is prohibited, as they serve for provision in case of invasion, and when the people are obliged to retreat to the mountains. In these are found parrots, starlings, and other birds, and some wild pigeons, which, in the proper season, are very good ; but the rest of the year are flabby and bitter. The landsnails and seacrabs, which abound greatly, cause vertigoes and shortness of sight. The n. part of this island is desert, through the unhealthy air that prevails there, and through the coast being rough and difficult of access; but the s. part is well inhabited, the soundings on this part of the coast are good, and fish is caught in great quantities, and of all sorts. It has only one convenient port, the entrance of which forms two channels : the same is fit for large vessels, and lies at the end of a deep bay called Basse Terre. The capital, which is the city of Cayona, is defended by fort D'Ogeron, a name it took from the governor by whose orders it was built, and who was the founder of this colony.

==[[Trinidad|TRINIDAD]]==, an island of the N. Sea, opposite the coast of Tierra Firme, 10 leagues distant from it and from the mouths of the Toro and the river Orinoco ; discovered by Admiral Columbus in his fourth voyage, in the year 1498, and conquered by Governor Antonio Berrio in 1592. Some make it 50 leagues long from e. to w. and 30 wide from n. to s. following the chronologer Antonio de Herrera ; whilst others, with greater probability, agree with Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo, who allow it to be only from 25 to 30 : [but according to the latest surveys its longest lines are from Cape Galera on the n. e. to Cape Ycacos, or Icaqui, on the s.w. 79 miles; and from Cape Galeota on the s. e. to Cape Blanca on the n. 56 miles.] It is the largest, most fertile, and most beautiful of all the Leeward Islands, and was thus compared by its discoverer to a paradise. It is full of forests of exquisite kinds of wood, such as cedars, walnuts, guaj/acanes, and many others. It abounds also in palms, in cocos (which grow spontaneously), and, as its temperature is hot, it is found well adapted for the cultivation of the sugarcane, which is one of its principal productions, yielding the greatest profit. Indigo grows on the sides of the roads naturally, and in the same abundance as briars in other parts. Here are vines yielding very good grapes, china oranges, lemons, and citrons, in such abundance as to be esteemed of little value. The crops of maize are so large, that quantities of this article are carried for sale to Margarita ; but the production of the greatest value in this island is the cacao, which, from its fine quality, is every where in request, in preference to that of Caracas ; and the crops were even bought up before they were gathered, so that the persons to whom they belonged refused to pay their tenths to the clergy, and strange to say, that, as it should seem, Heaven in chastisement of their covetousness, had entirely deprived them of this means of emolument, inasmuch as, since the year 1727, the whole of their crops have turned out fruitless and barren, with the exception of^one that belonged to a certain person, by name Rabelo, who had continued to pay his tythes, and whose estate is the only one in which that production is now furnished.   

TRINIDAD.

The opinions of writers concerning the quality of the land of this island is very various. Walter Raleigh, the Englishman, who visited it in 1593, says, that the n. part is mountainous; but that the soil is well adapted to the cultivation of sugarcane and tobacco. It abounds in wild hogs, in fish, birds, and animals; and the Spaniards confessed to the said Raleigh, that there was some gold in the rivers. In the reign of Charles I II. great pains were taken for increasing the cultivation, population, and commerce of this island, and there were planted in it coffee, cotton, and many other productions ; at the same time a regiment of infantry was established for its defence in the capital, which is S. Joseph de Oruna. 
[This island was, as Alcedo has observed, discovered by Columbus, in his fourth voyage, having entered, or rather been forced through the passage, called, at present, the Serpent's Mouth, Boca del Sierpe, by the force of the currents. It is said, that here he imagined all his labours were lost, or had ceased, and in consequence named the gulf he got into the Golfo Triste, as it was some time before he perceived the outlets now known by the name of Bocas del Drago, or Dragon's Mouths, and through which he sailed. It also received the name of Golfo de la Balena, from the vast quantities of whales which he then saw, and which now resort thither at certain periods of the year. 
The island is nearly of a square form, having two points stretching to the w. from its n. and s. corners. Point Icaque, which has been mentioned above, is about 10° 4' of n. lat. and is distant from the Macareo channel of the great river Orinoco, between five and six leagues, but from the nearest land of the American main lOf miles. 
The gulf is now known by that of the Gulf of Paria, from the opposite part of the continent, which runs to the w. and is perhaps one of the most beautiful sheets of water to be conceived, always placid, and having the best of anchorage throughout. The usual entrances for vessels coming from the n. e. or n. are by the Bocas del Drago. The first from the e. called the Boca de Monas, or Ape's Mouth, is only made use of by smali vessels. The second, Boca de Huivos, Egg Mouth, or Parasol Mouth, so called from the resemblance which a tree on the rock on the n. side of it has to a parasol, is the common passage for squarerigged vessels, provided the wind is strong enough to insure it. The third, Boca <le Navios, Ship's Mouth, is seldom used, except 

VOL. IV.  in going out. The Boca Grande is the best and surest, as all danger is avoided from the caprice of the currents. The breadth of the channel here to Point Moro on the Main is between two and three leagues. La Isla del Palo, or Duck Island, is situated within the gulf, about two leagues to the s. e. of the Grand Bocas, and five miles from the Spanish main. Ships coming into the gulf are obliged, generally, to pass to s. of this island, the strength of the current, as also certain shoals which lie between it and the main, frequently making it dangerous to attempt to weather it. The Serpent's Mouth, Boca del Sierpe, on the s. side, can only be made use of, as a channel of entrance, by vessels from the e. running down the coast of Guayana, the streams of the river Orinoco invariably rushing into the gulf with such vast strength, as to render it next to impossibility for vessels to stem it, and consequently to go out of the gulf by that channel. 
Properly speaking, there is no harbour within the gulf, except Chaguarama, and even it can only be classed as a roadsted, rendered disagreeable by a tendency of the currents to pass through it; yet the island of Chiccachiccanea, the westernmost of the Bocas, furnishes one of the finest in the whole W. Indies, and where ships of the largest rate may anchor, and lie with safety close to the sides, and the importance of this station is such, as to controul and command the whole Gulf of Paria, the proper course being close to this island ; but the gulf itself is not to be surpassed for anchorage throughout, and free from danger. 
Trinidad is happily situated out of the parallel of hurricanes, which have never as yet shifted so far to the s.; although, on the 12th of August, 1810, a very violent indication happened; it luckily lasted only a few hours, blowing only from the s. w. Shocks of earthquakes have been felt, but very slight, and not of such consequence as to cause alarm. 
The n. side of the island is a continued ridge of hilly mountains, which end at Toco, or Point Galera, and seem formerly to have been the continuation of the Parian Mountains, before the great convulsion, which, no doubt, has insulated Trinidad, and forced the passages of the Bocas. From the ridges or summits of the above hills, abundance of the finest and clear streams issue on both sides, and contribute on the s. side to form the river Caroni, which is considerable, and can be navigated by fiats and canoes some distance into the interior of the island. Another ridge of hills commences at L'Ebranche on the] <k H    602  

TRINIDAD.  
[e. side, and run in a s. w. course, and are called the Monserrat Hills ; the rivers or streams from which are distinguished bj a yellow clayish colour. A canal has been traced by order of government by Lieutenant-Colonel Rutherford, then surveyorgeneral, from the mouth of the Caroni to L'Ebranche, across the island, and passing through the valley which lies between these two ridges, which, if ever completed, must infallibly produce incalculable advantages to the colony, equally in a commercial as in an agricultural view, as its entrance on the e. side at once affords the easiest and most direct communication with the river Orinoco, and is therefore peculiarly adapted for trade with Spanish Guayana, and even with Santa Fe, Quito, and Lima. 
The gulf and coasts of the island abound with fish of various kinds, and fisheries in time might be established sufficient to furnish salted food for the Negroes ; even at present more appears at the market than is required for the. poorer classes of the free inhabitants. Oysters are to be had in abundance, particularly the class called mangroves, which fasten and breed on the branches of trees so named. Off Point Galera there are banks, which furnish them of a superior quality. Various sorts of shellfish are also to be found, including the finest lobsters, crabs, &c. as well as shrimps and prawns. The whole fishery might likewise be carried on with safety to great advantage at certain times of the year. 
The mornings and evenings in Trinidad are delightful, and the nights invariably cool and refreshing, although the heat is great during the day. Upon the whole, the island is undoubtedly full as healthy as any part of the new world, and many are the instances of people arriving at extreme old age. 
The population is of a very mixed nature, composed of no less than 17 different nations, according to the latest returns of the commissary of that department, and is enumerated at the bottom of this article. 
The introduction of the Chinese as colonists has been attempted without success, a consequence which might have been foreseen, as they were not accompanied by women of their own nation, a matter probably not easily to be accomplished : as it was, however, it has been found that no class would intermix with them ; indeed, with respect to the coloured part of the community, they would think themselves dishonoured, nay disgraced, by such a connection, as they respect and regard their rank and situation with extreme jealousy. The event, of course, has  been, that very few noAV exist in the island; some have died, but by far the greater proportion have returned to Europe with the intention of getting back to India, or their own country, their stipulation with government having provided for that object, should they not be satisfied with their situation in Trinidad. The few who remain are, in some measure, useful as pork butchers, or fishermen ; but for purposes of agriculture, none of them evinced the smallest disposition. 
It is scarcely to be doubted, but that Trinidad has already reached to its greatest state of population, unless the distraction of its neighbouring provinces on the continent may furnish yet some emigrant inhabitants. 
The island is divided into several districts under the superintendance of commandants and adjoints, who preserve the peace by adjusting small differences or complaints, and, if necessary, refer them either to the governor or the tribunals. 
Trinidad is capable of producing every article for the W. India market, equally, if not superior in many, to any other of the Windward Islands. Its sugar is excellent, and there is more land applicable for its culture than in Jamaica itself: at present, from the want of capital, the estates are small, and consequently not so productive as the larger properties of the same in the other islands. Cocoa, from not being subject to the demand of great capitals, bids fair to be the principal staple, and it is only lately that the advantages to be reaped from, provided any sale could be got for, it, have been noticed, and which will very soon be felt. The greatest part of the island is excellently adapted for this tree, and it has been found that it will bear its fruit, or pod, much sooner than generally was believed. Nature has furnished for it a tree, called the bois immortelle, or, by the Spaniards, la madre del cacao, in English, mother of the cocoa : it is planted at equal distances amongst the cocoa, and in the driest weather collects the dews, moistens, shades, and nourishes it. The cocoa once bearing continues to do so for many years. Coffee is excellent in its quality, but only planted on small properties, and does not add much to the revenue. The indigo is equal to the Guatemala plant, from which probably it was originally brought, as it is not aboriginal. The culture of it is by no means to be recommended, from its poisonous and pestilential smell, without a process could be introduced of effecting its manufacture by means of boiling,]   

TRINIDAD.  [which is said to be the case in India and Africa. Tobacco grows here, and is of a superior quality, but it is only planted for immediate use by the inferior class of inhabitants : what is used by the estates for the Negroes is imported. The want of this article, at times, is of a most serious nature, as the Negroes esteem it equally as necessary for their subsistence as food itself. The grape vines which have been brought from the s. of France, or from Spain, equal in flavour their parent stocks, and are delicious ; of course, at this period, they are only planted for the luxury of the table. All other fruits, or vegetables, congenial to the tropics, exist here, and even some European ones. 
In many quarters of the island large quarries of limestone, resembling, in some degree, marble, abound. Bricks and articles of pottery are likewise burnt, the clay having been found of a superior quality : of late tanneries have been established, and a substitute for hemp in making white rope has been discovered, and proved of use to the planters. 
The island is benefited with extensive wild savannahs, on which quantities of cattle, horses, and mules, are fed in common, but might be extended to exportation. The woods abound with game of different sorts, amongst which are deer, the lap or laba, the cuenca, a species of wild hog of exquisite flavour, and a variety of others of the same description. Among the feathered are the wild turkey, the ramier, the parrot, &c. with which the markets are daily supplied. 
The Lake Brea, or of pitch, is a most wonderful phenomenon ; it is of considerable size, about 150 acres, and capable of supplying all the naval dockyards of England, if not Europe. The Spanish government had shortly previously to the British conquest of the island found out its value, and intended to have made use of no other for their naval yards ; even at this day, the neighbours carry off, whenever they can, quantities for pitching their vessels and launches. It is of a bituminous quality, and most efficacious against worms, which are so destructive to shipping upon all the coast of Guayana. Its process is very simple, requiring only tallow to melt and refine it, which can be had at a very small price from the main, where such innumerable flocks of cattle are bred, and daily slaughtered for their hides only ; and as to fuel, it is at hand, and enough for centuries to come. 
Abundance of the finest timber, woods for construction, are to be found all over the island,  many of which are fit for the royal navy ; the best of them are as follows :  
Quarters within the Gulf, including Cuva.

The capital of the island, properly speaking, is St. Joseph de Oruna ; for all public acts were dated from thence by the Spaniards. It is a small village of plastered houses.

[anchored his vessels at Point a Brea, and ascended the river Caroni, into which the branch of the St. Joseph's empties itself. Since the capture, Port of Spain has supplanted St. Joseph's, and is the residence of the governor, and where all the courts are held. This town was lately burnt down, but is fast rebuilding Avith stone, and bids fair to surpass all others in that part of the world in size and handsome buildings, being regularly laid out at right angles, and blessed with the best of water from numerous wells : indeed, every valley throughout the island has a stream, larger or smaller, running through it. New towns have been laid out at St. Joseph's, St. Juan, St. Fernando, and Guayquayaro, but are yet in their infancy. 
The Spaniards and French enjoy the full extent of their religion, and have their churches accordingly, and their clergy are paid by government. The few Indians that remained on the island had been distributed into several missions by the Spaniards, and supplied with resident priests : the chief of them is Arima, which is a charming and healthy village, nearly in the middle of the road which goes across the island. These people are a docile quiet race, and are useful in cutting down lands for clearing; so are the Peons, who are a mixture of them and Spaniards. It has been with some trouble that the use of the stiletto has been restricted among them. The English chapel was burnt in the great fire; but a new church is about to be erected. The Missionary Society have built one lately. 
It had been the intention of the Spanish government to have constituted Chaguarama Harbour and the peninsula of Point Gourde their naval and military stations for the Windward Islands. The late Captain Columbine, of the navy, ascertained the uselessness of the first, and the incapability of the second, after a longdiscussion and struggle, was fully proved, and the strong hold has been removed to the hill, now called Fort George, a position which bids fair to preserve the sovereignty of the island, having every necessary qualification for a gar-  rison.  
Trinidad, although discovered in 1498, was not taken possession of by the Spaniards till about 1592: its importance was not noticed until the peace of Paris, when every measure was adopted for its rapid settlement. Encouragement was held out to all nations to colonize it (so unusual to the Spanish policy) ; lands were liberally granted; utensils for agriculture pro-  vided ; and Negroes were imported at great expense by the King of Spain, and afterwards sold to the new settlers at a very long credit, and comparatively at a small price. Induced by this, numbers of debtors and unfortunate people flocked thither from all the other colonies of the Antilles. The convulsions of France helped to increase the population ; both royalists and regicides successively emigrating there with the property each had been enabled to save. The island assumed the most rapid and flourishing appearance, and had the happiness, during that period, to have for its governor Don Chacou, a man of the most unbounded liberality, and who, if he had a bias, it was in favour of the British. The island was taken in 1797, without any resistance, by the late General Sir Ralph Abercromby ; indeed, the want of troops for its defence, and the state of the colony from such a congregate mixture of inhabitants, lendered it a sure and easy conquest. The Spanish squadron, consisting of some sail of the line and a few frigates, fell at the same time, and which had been anchored in the harbour of Chaguarama. 
The island is by far the finest of the W. India cluster ; the soil throughout being fit for every kind of culture, and the e. and s. coasts are not to be surpassed in the disposition of the land, the undulations of which are beautiful in the extreme ; and the position commands a safe and short passage to the several mouths of the river Orinoco, a river, the importance of which is very little known or understood at present. On the e. side is the extensive coco walk, and which gives its name to the bay ; it is selfplanted, the original nuts, as it is said, having been drifted ashore from some vessel which had been lost or wrecked off the coast. This walk now occupies a very long space or skirting, from the nuts of which abundance of oil may be extracted sufficient for consumption, and even exportation. In short, Trinidad can furnish various materials for a navy, such as timbers, plank, pitch, &c. and finally is capable of commanding, by the shortest route, the most ample share of the commerce of Lima and of Quito.

Trinidad, an island of the Strait of Magellan, near the island Santa Cruz. On the w. side of it the sea is very boisterous, but on the c. quiet and tranquil. It is low and desert, but covered with trees. [See Trinity Isle.] 
Trinidad, a city of the island of Cuba, situate on the s. side of the island, and on the shore of a river of the same name, with a celebrated port, at which is carried on the traffic in sugar and tobacco, both of excellent quality. Its natives, who are much given to seafaring, are good mariners. The English pillaged it in 1704. [A  very severe hurricane was felt here on the 14th of October, 1812; the damage sustained was incalculable; the houses which had fallen, and were reduced to a tottering condition, amounted to 500. In the country it was more severely felt, some breeding pens had lost upwards of 500 head of cattle ; many of the vessels which were at anchor in the harbour of Casilda were driven on shore, and others sunk. The convents of the Popa, with its hospital, viz. Francisca de Paula and Santa Anna, were all materially injured.] This city lies in lat. 21° 42' n. long. 80° 6' w. 
Trinidad, another city, of the kingdom of Guatemala, on the shore of the river Belen, in the province of Costarica, three leagues distant from the sea, but by an intransitable rout. It is 82 miles e. s. e. from Guatemala, in lat. 13° 46 / n. long. 90° 15' w. 
Trinidad, another, of the island Martinique, one of the Caribes, in a large bay, formed on the s. e. by the point of Caravela, which is two leagues long, and on the opposite side by a very high mountain united to the main by an isthmus of 200 feet wide. The e. part of this bay, which looks to its interior, is surrounded by a chain of rocks flush with the water, but appearing very visir bly at the ebb. The population is very flourishing, it being the residence of the governor of Cabesterre, besides many rich merchants, through the numerous trading vessels arriving here, especially from Nantes, as being sure of finding a ready dispatch of their cargoes, inasmuch as the inhar bitants of the district are ready to avail themselves of a supply at first hand, instead of buying on retail at Basseterre, not to mention that all vessels are here safe from hurricanes ; and another advantage, that, for their return to Eu-    606      rope, they start to the leeward of all the other islands, and escape a voyage of 300 leagues, which they would make were they to proceed by St. Domingo, or Puerto Rico. Although the parish and curacy of this city extends over the whole of Cabesterre, the church is built of wood. It yields much cacao, cotton, and sugar, which are the staples of its commerce. 
Trinidad, a town and capital of the province and alcaldia mayor of Sonsonate in the kingdom of Guatemala, situate near a bay on the coast of the S. Sea, four leagues from Acaxatla, 65 miles s. e. of Petapa, and 162 from Guatemala. It contains 450 families of Spaniards, exclusive of Mulattoes, Indians, and people of colour, five churches, and a monastery of nuns. It is the place of export for all the merchandise of Mexico and Peru, is three leagues from the bay ; and for this reason is considered the most desirable entrepot to those two kingdoms, although it is without defence. Notwithstanding the coast is too low for the shelter of vessels, the achorage is very good.

TROIS ==[[Rivieres|RIVIERES]]==, Three Rivers, or Treble River, a city of the province and government of Canada, thus called from three rivers, which unite themselves at a quarter of a mile from it, and enter the great river St. Lawrence. It was formerly the capital of the country, when the same belonged to the French, and was very much frequented by different nations of Indians, who used to come down these rivers to commerce in sfeins. It was the resi-    dence of the governor, who had under him a mayor, and in it was a convent of religious Franciscans, to whose care it belonged. This city was looked upon as the general emporium for merchandise, where all the natives of the country flocked to sell their skins, and other articles of traffic, previously to its being taken by the English, together with the establishment of Montreal ; but it was delivered up in 1635, and revisited by the above religious order in 1673 ; though, in 1760, it was retaken, as well as Quebec, Montreal, and all the rest of Canada, by the English generals, Wolf, Murray, and Amherst, and belongs to that crown at the present day. The population of the city is small, though the inhabitants are rich, and have large houses splendidly furnished. The country in the vicinity is barren in grain and fruits, but very pleasant. Its valleys, which are very delightful, lie about a gunshot from each other. The river is always covered with fishermen's boats, and affords an abundant supply, especially of large eels, which are driven down by the force of the tides from the sea. They catch them in baskets, and, when salted down in barrels, they are preserved for a long time good. This city is 55 miles s. w. of Quebec, and 62 n. e. of Montreal ; the navigation from one to the other is extremely delightful. [Three Rivers is very small, compared with Montreal and Quebec; but in size it ranks as the third town in Lower Canada. It is, however, scarcely larger than some English villages. Mr. Lambert, (whose account of this place is the  latest and the best) was not able to ascertain the exact number of houses and inhabitants; but the former, he believes, not to exceed 250, nor the latter 1500. There are very few respectable looking houses in the place ; the rest are paltry wooden houses, containing a few rooms on the ground floor, and a garret above. Some of them are in better condition than others ; but, for the most part, they appear to be falling to decay, from neglect. It is very seldom that the houses in Canada have any paint bestowed upon them ; but they are often whitewashed : yet few in Three Rivers have even this decoration to recommend them. 
The houses are mostly built with small intervals between them ; apparently to prevent accidents from fire. The streets are narrow, and unpaved, and on a dry windy day, the sand and dust fly about in clouds. The footpaths are badly kept up, by pieces of timber placed about three feet from the houses. Notwithstanding the]    eon  

TR0 1S RIVIERES.  
[inconveniences of the arid soil of Three Rivers, it has its advantages, inasmuch as you may walk out immediately after the heaviest rain, without soilingyour shoes. 
The woods being almost close at the back of the town, favour the retreat of innumerable musquitoes and sandflies. These with the multitude of common flies which inhabit the town, are extremely troublesome in sultry weather. 
The public buildings of Three Rivers, at the present day, are the convent of St. Ursule, the Roman Catholic church, the barracks, and the old monastery of the Recollets, or Franciscan friars ; which latter is now converted into a gaol, a court of justice, offices for the sheriff and prothonotary, a billiardroom, and an episcopalian chapel. The convent of St. Ursule was founded in 1677, by M. de St. Valier, bishop of Quebec, for the education of female children, and as an asylum for the poor, the sick, and those who were tired of the world. The number of nuns, at present, does not amount to more than twenty ; they are, for the most part, elderly women, and are governed by a superior. This nunnery was burnt down, for the second time, in 1806, and is not yet completely rebuilt. In consequence of the fire, the nuns were distributed in the convents of Quebec and Montreal ; and subscriptions were set on foot throughout the country, for the purpose of building a new one. The funds of the Ursulines were very poor, and the British inhabitants, much to their honour, contributed, in common with the French people, in aid of the institution ; a convincing proof of the unanimity of Catholics and Protestants in that country. The new convent was opened early in 1808, for the reception of the nuns, though then not more than half finished. The house is very long, and built in the form of a cross : the chapel, for the performance of mass, is in the centre on the groundfloor ; together with the refectory ; the hall, and kitchen ; the rooms for educating the children ; and the apartments of the cure, or minister, who resides in the convent, and performs the religious duties of the house and chapel. The present resident is the Abbe de Calonne, brother to the celebrated prime minister of Louis XVI. He was allowed by the English government to retire to Canada, and arrived in the autumn of 1807. He is said to be a very amiable and accomplished man, and appears about sixty years of age. 
The French church, in which service is performed by the grand vicar, and his assistants, is a plain stone building, roofed with shingles painted red, and ornamented with a small belfry and  spire, covered with sheets of tin. In the interior is a handsome altar piece, adorned with gilt ornaments, silver candlesticks, flagons, wax tapers, crucifixes, &c. The church is generally well attended, and in summer is often very crowded ; duringthat season, a great many people sit or kneel in the open air, close by the doors, or under the windows of the church ; the mass being sung loud enough for them to hear without. 
The English church is very small, being part of the chapel formerly occupied by the Franciscan friars, who resided in the adjoining building. The other part is appropriated to a court of justice, and is divided from the place of worship by a slight partition. It is only of late years, that an English minister has resided in the town ; and, from appearances, there indeed seems very little occasion for him even now, since it is not unusual to see the French church overflowing, morning and afternoon, on Sundays, and open every day in the. week besides ; while the English church, not a fourth of the size, is shut up all the week, except for two hours on Sunday morning, and then never half filled. The Protestant inhabitants are nevertheless sufficiently numerous to crowd it to excess. 
The Recollet building is of stone, and much dilapidated. Next to the church and courthouse, are the offices of the prothonotary, adjoining which, on the ground floor, are the rooms that are at present converted into a goal. Above them are the sheriff's office, and the subscription billiardroom. There are several small taverns or publichouses in Three Rivers, kept by French Canadians ; but only one decent house for the accommodation of respectable travellers. The building now occupied by the soldiers of the Canadian Fencibles for barracks, was formerly the residence of the French governor. It is built of stone, and compared to the houses in the town is of considerable magnitude. It is situated on the most elevated part of the town, and has a courtyard in front, inclosed by a wall and gates ; an old stone building near it, is turned into a guardhouse. On the right side of the barracks is an excellent garden, and on the left is a small lawn, where the soldiers are drilled and exercised. 
The Canadian fencible regiment is commanded by Colonel Shank, who resides at Three Rivers! It was formerly raised in Scotland, and consisted of a thousand men, but in consequence of some misunderstanding, the soldiers, who were all married men with large families, refused to embark for Canada ; upon which the regiment was]

TROIS RIVIERES.  [disbanded, and the officers, together with some of the noncommissioned officers, were sent out to Canada, to recruit in that country. They have been out upwards of three years, and have procured about 500 men, the majority of whom are French Canadians ; there are also many Americans from the United States among them. Most of the officers are Scotchmen, and were employed in the American war ; for their services on that occasion they had grants of land in the country. Colonel Shank particularly distinguished himself in some engagements during that contest. He afterwards commanded the Queen's Rangers, and received from government a large tract of land in Upper Canada. The French Canadians make tolerable steady soldiers ; but the Europeans that are picked up in different parts of the country, are generally a drunken dissolute set, and give the officers a great deal of trouble by their frequent desertion. The province, of late years, has paid the inhabitants £.10 or £.12 for every deserter they apprehend, and this has made the people very alert, so that few now can escape out of the country. 
The remains of two redoubts, or fortifications, thrown up by the English army in the American war, are still visible on the common, and upon the hill at the back of the town. The latter commands the whole of Three Rivers, and is furnished with a well in the centre, for supplyingthe soldiers with water. A large cross is erected near the spot, adorned with the instruments used at the crucifixion ofourSaviour,andotherornaments. 
The trade of Three Rivers is confined chiefly to the supplying of the inhabitants of the town and surrounding country, with European manufactured goods and W. Indian produce. The family of the Harts, who are Jews, carry on nearly all the business that is transacted in the town. There are four brothers, three of whom reside in Three Rivers, and have separate stores. The other, Alexander Hart, resides at Montreal. They are said to be possessed of considerable property, and besides the stores which thev keep, deal largely in furs, potash, &c. one of them is a manufacturer of pot and pearl ash, and a brewer of ale and spruce beer. They purchase most of the furs, brought down from the interior by a small party of Indians, who pay an annual visit to Three Rivers. This trade, which a century and a half ago was the total support of the town, is now greatly diminished. The agents of the N. W. Company are scattered over every part of the ulterior, and much money has been sunk in order *o monopclise the whole of the fur trade. But a 

VOL. IV.  few of the Indians, from the back country, choose to bring their furs to the Harts, at Three Rivers, and receive European goods and money in exchange, very often to a considerable amount. An Indian once gave Mr. E. Hart, 60 guineas for a clock, and five guineas for a brilliant ring to decorate the finger of his squaw. Another has been known to pay four or five guineas for a little cannister of gunpowder tea, which he carried away with him under his dirty blanket. Many of the Indians, who are fond of dress, will go to a great expense in the purchase of silver ornaments, and superfine scarlet or blue cloth, coloured silk, &c. with which they decorate themselves in a costly manner. During their stay, they encamp about a mile from the town, and are generally in a state of intoxication the whole time, so that when they return in the autumn to their hunting grounds, they have most commonly spent all their money. They are then obliged to go in debt to the Harts, sometimes to the amount of several hundred dollars, which they punctually repay in furs the following year. But if they die in the mean time, the money is lost. 
There are but few other stores of any consideration in Three Rivers, and they are kept chiefly by French people. These stores contain almost every description of goods that can be named, and exhibit a motley collection of woollendrapery, haberdashery, hosiery, linendrapery, grocery, cheesemongery, stationery, ironmongery, and the contents of the oil shop, the gin shop, and the wine vaults. The storekeepers charge from 50 to 100 per cent, profit upon most of their goods, and sometimes a great deal more. The Harts import a considerable portion of their goods from England, the rest they purchase at the Quebec auctions ; they also deal largely in pot and pearl ashes and furs, which they remit to England. 
A store belonging to Messrs. Munro and Bell, of Quebec, is established at Three Rivers, for the sale of the castiron stoves, potash kettles, and bariron, manufactured at the St. Maurice forges which belong to those gentlemen. The store is superintended by Mr. Graves, and the forges by Mr. M'Cauley. They make about 1000 stoves per annum ; the small single stoves sell for £3. and the larger sort for £6. each. The double stoves, which have an oven at the top, are sold for £10 or £12. according to the size. Potash kettles sell from £.20 to £.25 each. Fresh veins of ore are daily discovered, and purchased of the people in whose land it is found, at a trifling price."]    ■■     T R O  
[Most of the large bark canoes for the N. W. Company are made at Three Rivers; and several women in the town make a variety of handsome toys, pocketbooks, purses, work baskets, pincushions, &c. of bark, curiously ornamented with flowers worked on the bark with elk hair, dyed of various colours. The Indians make a few bark works of an inferior description. 
At a short distance from the town there is a brickmaker, and, it is thought, the only one in Canada. The bricks are nearly of the same size as those in England, but not quite so thick ; they are of a deep red, and are made in a peculiar manner. Instead of throwing the clay in a mould, it is spread out to a great extent on a smooth piece of ground, of the thickness of one brick, the clay is then cut into parallelograms, each of which are afterwards subdivided into nine bricks ; they are then left to dry, and when sufficiently hard, are taken up and piled in stacks, after which, they are formed into a kiln and burnt as in England. 
The genteel society of Three Rivers is very small, and consists of the officers of the Canadian regiment, the provincial judge, sheriff, English and French advocates ; the Protestant and Catholic clergy ; the grand voyer of the district ; the colonel of militia; and the family of the Harts, who are the only merchants or storekeepers that are classed among the gentry of Three Rivers. 
The market is held twice a week, on the post days ; and in general the supplies are scarcely sufficient for the consumption of the town. The country people come from Champlain across the St. Maurice river, and from Becancour on the opposite shore of the St. Lawrence. They arrive at Three Rivers in the summer, as early as five o'clock in the morning, and most of the inhabitants are in the market place frequently an hour before their arrival, in order to have their choice of the provisions. By eight o'clock the market is generally over. 
Many of the females at Three Rivers are troubled with wens, swelled necks, andother disorders of the throat, as mumps, swelling of the glands, &c. In other parts of Canada, there are but few who are afflicted with those complaints ; but in Three Rivers they seem to be more general, particularly among the women. Some are of opinion, that they are occasioned by the wellwater of the town ; others, that they are caused by the water of the St. Lawrence, which is impregnated with snow and ice upwards of six months in the year. But if swelled necks were   occasioned by snow water, why should they not prevail equally at Quebec and Montreal, where the river water is used in abundance ? It is certain, however, that in some of the mountainous parts of Switzerland and Styria, the women have large wens and swellings on their necks, called by the Styrians bronchoceles, which are supposed to arise from the frequent use of snow water. It is possible, therefore, that the same disease in Canada may arise, in some measure, from a similar cause. 
In other respects Three Rivers is favourable to health, and possesses a more steady climate than Quebec, which being situated in the neighbourhood of so many lofty mountains, is oftener subject to rain, and frequent variations of the weather. 
Small as the town of Three Rivers is, the number of foundlings, who are placed under the care of a poor person to bring up, are equal, in proportion to its population, to the number of children at the Foundling Hospital in London. It would be creditable to the inhabitants of Three Rivers, were they as well taken care of as in London ; but the contrary is the case : for in consequence of the scanty allowance for their support, little attention is paid to them, and we are told that few live to maturity.

It is on the easternmost part of the peninsula of Cape Cod, 47 miles s. e. of Boston, in a straight line, but as the road runs it is 110, and 40 from the courthouse of Barnstaple. It is the Pamet of the Indians, and after its settlement in 1700 was some time called Dangerfield ; it was incorporated under its present name in 1709, and contains 1193 inhabitants. Only one family of Indians remained a few years since, and lived on Pamet Point. In the valley called Great Hollow, a creek sets up from the bay, at the mouth of which is a tide harbour. The other landing places are of small note. Pamet Harbour is about 100 yards wide at the mouth, but is wider within ; and if repaired would be of public utility. It lies above eight miles s. e. of Cape Cod Harbour. The hill on which the meetinghouse stands branches from the high land of Cape Cod, well known to seamen. The mountain of clay in Truro, in the midst of sandy hills, seems to have been placed there by the God of Nature, to serve as a foundation for a lighthouse, which if erected might save the lives of thousands, and millions of property. The soil of Truro is, in most places, sandy, like Provincetown ; and the inhabitants derive their principal subsistence from the sea, which here abounds with vast variety of fish. Great part of their corn and vegetables are procured from Boston and the neighbouring towns. Two inhabitants of Truro f Captains David Smith and Gamaliel Collings, were the first who adventured to Falkland Islands in pursuit of whales. This voyage, which was crowned with success, was undertaken in 1774, by the advice of Admiral Montague of the British navy. The whalemen of Truro now visit the coast of Guayana and Brazil. Many of the masters of ships employed from Boston and other ports, are natives of Truro. The elderly men and small boys remain at home to cultivate the ground ; the rest are at sea twothirds of the year. The women are generally employed in spinning, weaving, knitting. &c] 

==[[Truxillo|TRUXILLO]]==, a province and corregbniento of the kingdom of Peru, bounded on the n. e. by the province of Caxamarca, on the n. by that of Sana, on the c. by that of Guamachuco, on the s. e. by that of Santa, and having for its  miles n. by w. of Halifax, and 40 from Pictou. limits on the s. the river Sana, and the royal It was settled bv the North-Irish, some Scotch, road leading to Lima, from whence it extends 4 1 2  TRUX1LL  
24 leagues ; and being bounded on the s. w. and w. by the S. Sea, the coast of which runs j. e. and n. w. It is composed of three valleys, namely, of Chiraru, Viru, and Chicama, in which it rains only in the months of June, July, and August, a sort of dew called there garua. It is 27 leagues long and 10 broad, and has in its jurisdiction three ports, Malabrigo, Guariape, and Guanchaco ; it is of a very fine temperature although rather cold, very healthy, and the ground agreeable and fertile. Several rivers water and fertilize it, especially that of Moche, which is a source of great wealth. It produces a great deal of wheat, maize, wine, olives, sugarcanes, and all sorts of grain, flowers, limes, esculent plants, and fruits, such as plantains, pines, lucmas, granadillas, guuyabas, mameyes, palillos, cucumbers, tumbos, and chirimoyas, which are esteemed the most delicate of all Peru. Formerly the corn they reaped was so abundant, that the earth yielded regularly in the harvest two hundred fold, and the produce of the valley of Chicama alone amounted to 160,000 bushels; but since the great earthquake, which happened on the 20th of October, 1687, the soil has been so sterile, that hardly any thing yielded fruit for more than SO years ; but it now begins to recover by degrees its ancient fertility. Almost the whole province is filled with plantations, which yield a great quantity of sugar and other productions, In which they carry on a great trade. 
Truxillo, the capital, is the city of the same name, suffragan of Lima, erected by Paul V. in 1609. It was founded by Don Francis Pizarro, Marquis of Charcas and Atavillos, conqueror of Peru, in 1535, and named by him in memory of his native place in Estramadura. It is situate in an agreeable and fine plain, called De Chimu, from originally possessing the land of a chief of that name, which signifies a powerful lord : it is abundant in corn and sugar, with which they make exquisite sweetmeats, that constitute the principal article of their commerce ; its climate is cold and dry, but very mild and wholesome ; the soil is sandy, and consequently inconvenient for walking, and for the inhabitants. It is of an oval figure, and surrounded with a wall of bricks unbaked, built by the viceroy, the Duke of Palata, having 15 bastions, and as many curtains ; the streets are 45 feet broad, and run n. e. and s. w. ; the houses are very pleasant, and magnificently ornamented : it has, besides the cathedral, three parishes, St. Ann's, St. Sebastian's, and St. Stephen's ; convents of monks of the orders of St. Francis, St. Domingo, La Merced,  and St. Austin, a college which was of the Jesuits, and an hospital of the Bethlemites ; monasteries of the nuns of St. Clare, and of the barefooted Carmelites, and a seminary. 
It has suffered much from several earthquakes: first, on the 14th of February, 1619, in memory of which the city voted St. Valentine for its patron ; next, on the 6th of January, 1625 ; then on the 20th October, 1759, and 2d September. 1759. Great riches have been discovered in this district, which were hidden by the Indians on the invasion of the Spaniards ; John Gutierrez de Toledo, in particular, discovered a quantity in 1576 ; the king's share, being onefifth, amounted to 58,527 castellanos of gold. 
At the distance of one league runs the river Mocha, which fertilizes the district, and from which they draw, through conduits, water, as well for the consumption of the people as for the irrigating the orchards and gardens. The inhabitants, who amount to more than 9000, and amongst whom are many illustrious families descended from the conquerors, are docile, affable, liberal, and of sharp intellects. The arms are a shield azure, bearing a griffon, and in the centre two columns, white and blue, over water, in which is placed a crown of gold crossed with two sticks, and at the bottom the letter K. It lies three quarters of a league from the sea. 
[The intendancy of Truxillo contained, according to the official accounts in the Guia del Peru, in the year 1797, 87 doctrinal curacies, five cities, two towns, and 142 settlements annexed to the same, containing 230,967 souls, viz. 460 clergy, 160 monks, 162 nuns, 19,098 Spaniards, 115,647 Indians, 76,949 Mustees, 13,757 free Mulattoes, and 4725 slaves. 
There are two districts belonging to this intendancy, called Cescado de Truxillo and Lambayeque. The former contained, in the year 1797, 10 doctrinal curacies, and six settlements annexed, inhabited by 12,032 souls, viz. 144 clergy, 60 monks, 129 nuns, 1431 Spaniards, 4577 Indians, 1549 Mustees, 2357 free Mulattoes, and 1582 slaves ; and the latter (Lambayeque) contained20doctrinal curacies and seven settlements annexed, inhabited by 35,192 souls, viz. 62 clergy, 27 monks, 2299 'Spaniards, 22,333 Indians, 5448 Mustees. 3192 free Mulattoes, 'and 1831 slaves. 
The city is situate 268 miles n. n. to. from Lima, in lat. 8° 8" s. and long. 78° 53' w.]

Don Balthazar Jayine Martinez Companon was precentor of the holy metropolitan church of Lima, when his majesty presented him to the bishopric of Truxillo in 1778, and which he now actually holds. 
[N. B. We find by the Guia del Peru, a work from which we have .quoted above, that the last mentioned bishop governed till 1788 ; but it does not say whether he died in that year, nor is the series continued from that period in any work we have been able to discover.] 
Truxillo, another city, of the same name as the above, in the province and district of Venezuela, and in the new kingdom of Granada : Captain Diego Garcia de Parades founded it in a place called Escuque, on the summit of a mountain close to the large river Motatan, where he remained but a short time ; for the youth of the place havjng taken improper liberties with the daughters and wives of the neighbouring Indians, the latter, being greatly irritated, one night assaulted the city and put a number of the offenders to death ; and they continued t\\e siege so as to oblige the inhabitants to depart in the following years, 1557 and 1558. It was, however, resettled under Francis Ruiz, who gave it the name of Mirabel, which it retained very few days, having resumed the original name : but experiencing the inconveniences of continual rains, repeated storms, and owing to the humidity of the neighbourhood, the people were sent to Cabecera, one of the valleys on the banks of the river Bocono ; here they fomented such discord and dissentions among their neighbours, that they were sent immediately afterwards to another place, called De los Truenos, at the mouth of the river Motatan, where no grain was produced, from the plague of ants, which destroyed the whole of it ; nor did the cattle increase, from the voracity of the tigers, which are so obnoxious, even to  

TRUXILLO.  the inhabitants, that they were obliged to decamp for a third time ; establishing themselves in another place yet more inconvenient, four leagues lower down the same river on the centre of a mountain so rugged, wet, and full of mosquitoes, snakes, tigers, and insects ; that, persecuted with so many calamities, and by the badness of the temperature of the neighbourhood, they were sent a fourth time, six leagues more to the e. of the valley of Pampa, where they were able to remain but a short time, on account of the excessive heat and humidity of the country ; and they then exclaimed bitterly, but in vain, against the uncertainty of climate, since they were doomed from the above cause, to transmigrate, until the city might be said to be portable. They however bore with these evils until 1570, when, obliged to remove, they fixed their fifth and last foundation, in the present site ; in a valley of a wholesome and more moderate climate, which extends about a league n. and s. ; but is so confined, that one half the city admits of but two streets : and the other half, so much more confined, that it admits of only one. It appears, that the climate converted the fractious and quarrelsome tempers of the people, to dispositions more quiet and pacific ; since discord and strife are unheard of here. And it is sufficient throughout all the kingdoms to characterise a man as ingenious, and of a good disposition, his being known to be of Truxillo. 
This city became one of the most beautiful and opulent by the great trade in its productions, especially in cacao, to the improvement of which the inhabitants applied themselves ; planting a great number of trees in the valleys of Poco, which, transported by the lake to Gibraltar, produced them immense riches: with which they erected costly and beautiful houses ; but felicity changing to calamity, they have been since so dejected, that at present hardly a shadow of their greatness remains ; and losing the cacao trees by the inundations of the river, scarcely any trade or commerce exists. To this misfortune followed the sacking of the city, in 1678, by the pirate, Francis Peter Gramont, who burnt and destroyed the sumptuous edifices. At present there are somewhat more than 300 inhabitants, and, besides the parish church, two convents of the monks of St. Francis and St. Domingo ; one hermitage of Our Lady of Chiquinquia, in which there is founded an hospital, and two nunneries of Dominicans, in which they manufacture beautifully, many curiosities and pieces of needle'- work, which are much esteemed throughout the kingdom,  
This district is very abundant in corn, barley, maize, cotton, pulse, and similar seeds ; they make a great quantity of sugar, which affords them exquisite preserves, and have every sort of fruit to be found in America, and many of those of Europe. They rear an immense number of ewes and goats, fowls, turkeys, and other birds ; so that they want nothing that can be thought necessary for the luxury or convenience of life. But these advantages are counterpoised by the calamity under which all the inhabitants suffer, namely the cotos, or swellings of the throat, caused no doubt by the waters of the river being impregnated with metals. 
[There is no city in the province of Venezuela, that has made such rapid improvenent as Truxillo. The salubrity of the air, and the fertility of the soil, have attracted many settlers ; which has increased the number of its inhabitants to 7,G00 persons. The remains of many superb buildings sufficiently attest the magnificence of the town before it was destroyed by Gramont. 
Little with regard to its productions can be said, in addition to what was related at the time Alcedo wrote ; the sheep that are bred here, are of an extraordinary size, and the mutton is preferable to that of any other part of the province. The cheeses are also held in high estimation, and the inhabitants are famous for the cleansing and carding of wool, which they manufacture for trade. The women are in a much better condition than in the other towns, on account of their industry in making and disposing of preserves. 
There is a trade from Truxillo to Maracaibo, by the lake, which is 42 miles to the w. ; but the chief traffic is with Carona, where they send the skins of the sheep and goats to be dressed ; but the carriage by this rout is very inconvenient, as they have to pass over some unwholesome plains. This city has a cabildo for its police. It lies 77 miles to the s. of Coro, 58 to the s. w. of Tucuyo, and 42 from the lake of Maracaibo, and 59 n. of Varinas. In lat. 8° 33' n. long. 70° 15' 30" w.~] 
Truxillo, another city, capital of the province and government of Honduras in the kingdom of Guatemala : founded by Francis de las Casas in 1524. It is situated between two rivers of good water, and abounding in fish. The climate is temperate, fertile in all kinds of grain, and there is abundance of cattle, particularly black cattle ; which is much more fleshy than that of Spain. It produces much honey and wax, and the vines and wheat yield twice a year. The lemons, oranges, and the other fruits of Europe have so multiplied, that they are no  TUB  longer looked upon as any rarity. It produces in like manner a quantity of sugarcanes from which they make sugar ; also, the canopotola, or purging cassia. Inks district it has mines of the richest gold. 
It was named Truxillo, from the greater part of its founders being of the city of that name in Estremadura ; it was the capital of the province, and its cathedral was therefore erected into a bishopric, continuing so until 1558, when it was translated to Valladolid, from whence it is 60 leagues distant. The parish church is very large and good, it has a convent of monks, of La Merced, an hospital with the name of Our Lady of La Conception, and a good port, which is very commodious and celebrated; the principal one of this coast, and from whence Hernan Cortes embarked on his return to Mexico from the journey to Ibueras ; the same was pillaged by the Dutch at the end of the last century.

==[[Tucuman|TUCUMAN]]==, a province and government of Peru, belonging to the viceroyalty of Buenos Ayres ; bounded on the n. by the province of Chichas and Lipes ; from the n. w. to w. by that of Atacama, and on the w. and s. w. by that of Cuyo of the kingdom of Chile. The territory from this latter rhumb to the s. e. being a desert and having the plains overrun by savage Indians ; namely, the Aucaes, Huarcas or Pampas, Pihuenches, Puelches, Uncos, aud other nations which inhabit the serranias or mountains contiguous to the cordillera or smaller chain of Chile : which extends to the Straits of Magellan. This province is bounded towards the 5. e. by the jurisdiction of Santa Fe, belonging to the govern4.K  ciia  
TUCU M A N.  gones the  ment of Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata ■ and from the e. point to the n. where it joins the province of Chichas: it has for limits, the delightful regions of Chaco Gualamba, an uncultivated and mountainous country inhabited by different savage nations. 
Tucuman, extends from 22° to 33\ ° ; and its length is from the rivulet of Quiaca, which divides it from Chichas unto Melingue, towards Buenos Ayres, almost 370 leagues ; which they travel in carts. The breadth is, at the widest, 190 from e. to w. 
The first discoverers of this country divided it into three provinces, with respect to the three nations they found there ; namely, the Juries who occupied the eastern part, the Diaguiras the western, in many valleys : and the Comichinto the s. where at the present day stands city of Cordova. These latter Indians dwelt in caves underneath the earth. Diego de Roxas, first discovered and conquered this province in 1543, by order of the Licentiate Vaca de Castro, governor of Peru ; with some of those captains who served against Diego de Almagro the younger. These, entering the plains, encountered some settlements of Indians ; and in the valleys of Salta and Calchaqui, certain tribes who were bold enough to face the Spaniards, when a serious affray took place, in which Diego de Roxas lost his life. 
After several disturbances in the Spanish armies about a successor to the command, and the eonquest of the territory appearing desperate, they returned to Peru just at the time that the Brigadier General Francis de Carbajal had defeated Diego de Centeno, in the battle of Pocona ; and who immediately turned his victorious arms against the new comers. After Peter de la Gasca conquered Gonzalo Pizarro in Xaquixahuana in 1548, he entrusted the conquest of Tucuman to John Nunes de Prado, who commenced it in 1550, with little more than 80 men. Founding near the sierra^ a city they called Barco, in compliment to Gasca, who was of the settlement of that name, near Avila. 
Francisco de Villagra, passing by the town in 1551, as he was carrying succours to Peter de Valdivia, for the conquest of Chile, subdued the city and its founder to his obedience, in the name of Valdivia ; pretending that the province was a part of that kingdom. And immediately that he had attained his object, he sent thither as his lieutenant, Francis de Aguirre, who removed the said city of Barco, to the boundary of the Juries Indians ; and it was for many years the capital  province, subject to  the kingdom  of  of that Chile. 
Aguirre reduced and registered 47,000 Juries and Toconotes Indians at Santiago, the river Salado, and La Sierra : distributing them into 56 parishes. And John de Zuriata, who succeeded him in the government, founded a city in the valley of Calchaqui ; as also another in the valley of Conando, 80 leagues to the s. s. e. which he called London, in compliment to Queen Mary of England, who had espoused Philip II. These cities were afterwards destroyed by the Indians, during the government of Castaneda. 
The climate of this province is hot, in proportion to its distance from the torrid zone ; and it is observed that those places nearest the equator, are cold in the degree, as the country becomes more elevated : until it joins the mountainous tracts, or cordillera of Peru. The seasons are regular, and the fertility general throughout ; as the soil is fat and porous to a certain depth. It produces all sorts of seeds, esculent plants, and fruits in abundance ; with plenty of excellent pasture for the immense breeds of mules, horses, mares, and other sorts of cattle. And, what might appear incredible is, that if the earth does not yield more produce, it is merely because there are not a proportionate number of inhabitants for the consumption. The average amount of these may be taken at 100,000, whereas the extent and fertility of the country is equivalent to the support of four millions. In some places they have wine, of which they make brandy ; they have abundance of cotton, and of a very fine quality ; excellent timber for building, with which tney do not neglect to trade : especially in boards, which are carried in carts drawn by oxen, from the city of St. Michael to Salta, Santa Fe, and Buenos Ayres. 
It also supplies the timber which is necessary at Potosi, for the engines of the miners : receiving for each axletree, which by the bve ismade of the very strongest and best wood, from 1800 to 2000 dollars, on account of the labour of transporting such bulky articles over rugged and difficult roads. It has also guayacanes, box trees, laurels, pines, dragon trees, walnut trees, very high palm trees, and many others. They gather here a quantity of honey, of which they have twelve different kinds ; also an acid, which is made by a species of bee under the earth. A great quantity of white wax, of the smooth podded tare of which they make mead ; cochineal, indigo, and flax, but which are productions of little use : since they do not benefit by them. They  

TUCUMA N.  abound in every species of game, which they do not destroy, such as tigers, and small lions that they call pumas, hogs, deer, elks, quiriquinchos, hares, viscachas, anteaters, huanacos, vicunas, ostriches, and many insects ; various species of snakes, amongst which is that they call ampolaba, which appears like the trunk of a large tree, and which feeds on small animals that it attracts with its breath, the same being tame and unwieldy : here are also a multitude of large spiders' webs, which might supply the place of silk. 
In the rivers and lakes of this province is found abundance of fish, sparus aurata, (Linn.) dentados, eels, and many other sorts. 
Many rivers water this province, all which, with the exception of two, after having run many leagues, disappear, forming lakes, or losing themselves in the earth : the principal rivers are the Salado, the Xuxuy, the Dulce, and the Quarto. There is no dearth of mines in this province ; for, although the greater part is level, there are high lands where Nature has deposited her treasures ; for instance, in the serranias, which, on the w. run towards Peru, and are branches of the cordillera, as is that of Aconcagua : there are tracts always covered with snow, in which there are mines of silver, several veins of which were worked at the end of the last century (the 17th), but which were abandoned, on account of wars and disturbances with the Indians of Chaco. There have been lately discovered the entrances of many mines worked by the Indians before the conquest, the metal of which, it appears, they worked by fusion. Similar mouths have also been discovered in a place called Pulares, in the valley of Chalcaqui, and in two other places of the mountains, called Tampatamba and Paeta, and in that of Acui, near which are also mines of copper, and towards the confines that divide this province from Atacama, are the gold mines of Incahuasi, and of Olaros ; and in La Ouna are others, the working of which is assisted by some Indians of the settlements of Casivinco and Cochinoca, belonging to the estate of the Marquis of Valle del Toxo (the only title that nobleman enjoys), and other loy, were discovered  likewise of gold,  though of base al and worked in  
1757,  in the serranias of Cordoba; others also in the mountain of the district of Rioxa, but which have not been worked for want of hands. 
The principal trade of this province is that in mules, which they bring from the jurisdictions of Cordova, Santa Fe, and Buenos Ayres, buying  them for two, three, or four dollars. These animals are suffered to winter in the confines of Salta, in order to fatten and give them fresh vigour, (for many of them are often much injured in travelling), whence those fit for service are taken and sold every year to the number of from 30,000 to 50,000. The purchasers immediately drive them to the provinces of Peru, where they are worth from 12 to 17 dollars each. They also often drive with them from 14,000 to 16,000 cows for the miners, the original price of which is from 12 to 14 reals, and one for the hide, of which they make very good sandals. This province also trades in soap, which it sends in trunks covered with hides to Peru, paying a duty to the king of 11 reals for each cargo, besides a toll of three for each cow, and six for a mule, according to the decree of 1740, by which the produce was destined for the defence of the frontier against the unsubjected Indians, and for the pay of the troops, and support of the forts constructed for that purpose. The mules are subject to a disease in their hoofs, which is here badly named del baso (of the milt), and the drivers assert, that it is contagious, and is communicated to those that are healthy, by passing over the ground on which the diseased have trodden ; but in reality it is nothing but the feet being bruised by the great distance they travel, especially if they have tender feet, and therefore those who are experienced will take care, during the winter, which they generally pass near Salta, to procure pastures that are dry, and not liable to be overflowed, whereby the hoof may be predisposed to the above disease, by being rendered spongy and porous. 
There is scarcely a province the population of which has experienced so many changes, by the continual irruptions of the Indians, as this ; for they surround it on the e. and s. and formerly by the w. and have assaulted and annoyed the people, so as to drive them from their fields, retiring immediately that they had committed the first hostility ; when, although they might leave many killed, they invariably would return loaded with spoil; for which reason the province has been always in arms, and has not increased its population in proportion to its extent, climate, and fertility. It is moreover obliged, in order to check the same infidel Indians, to maintain, as a defence, several garrisons and fortresses in the places most exposed to their invasions, and there the number of inhabitants is frequently very considerable : these garrisons are at present 4 k 2  m  TUCUMAN.

The monks of the extinguished order of the Jesuits established some missions where various settlements were founded, containing 24,000 persons reduced to social life, who have served at times as militia to the governors when they have attempted to invade Chaco ; and they were very dexterous in the use of arrows, darts, and lances. They are very inimical to the Indians of Chaco, and particularly to the Mataguayos, which is the most numerous, unfaithful, and traitorous nation of all. The above subjected people are employed in agricultural occupations, and raise abundant crops of maize, zapayos, and other seeds and fruits : they cultivate tobacco, cotton, and agipara, for their trade with the neighbouring cities, and their time is distributed with the greatest regularity between their labour and instructions; and thus they acquire many commodities which they had not before. They are at present under the care of the monks of St. Francis. 
There is a tradition here, of the province having been inhabited by giants ; some of the bones of whom have been discovered washed up by torrents out of the beds of deep ravines, and some little time back there were found in the curacy of La Punilla, of the jurisdiction of Cordoba, a human skull four fingers thick. The number of inhabitants amounts, as we have already observed, to 100,000, and the capita], 
Tucuman, is the city of the same name, with the dedicatory title of St. Michael, founded in 1564 by Don Diego de Yillarroel, and translated in 1685 by the governor Don Fernando de MendozaMate deLuna, on account of an inundation in 1680, which swept away the church and a street of houses. It is 12 leagues from the place where it first stood, in a pleasant field, though without water, and the inhabitants can hardly procure any, except what they draw from some wells, and from a trench which has been made from the river, running at a league's distance, by the first founders, and lately repaired by the governor Don Geronimo Matorras. It is of a mild temperature, and very abundant in fruits ; it is the head of a bishopric erected in 1570, and contains, besides the cathedral church, dedicated to St. Michael, patron of the city, a con-  vent of monks of St. Francis, another of La Merced, and a college which belonged to the Jesuits. It has some trade, although very trifling in the breed and sale of mules, but the principal traffic consists in taming oxen for the carts. [It is 1170 geographical miles in a direct line, crossing part of the Peruvian Sea, by the said direct line, from Lima, 462 to the s. of La Plata, and lies in lat. 26° 49' s. and long. 64° 36' ©.]
